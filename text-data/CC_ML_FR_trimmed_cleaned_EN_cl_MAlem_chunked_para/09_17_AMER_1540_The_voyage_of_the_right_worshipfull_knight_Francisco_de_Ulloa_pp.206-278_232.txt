wind whereof we have most need , to follow our voyage , whereat we be all glad for the great desire which we have to depart out of that place . therefore we begin to set sail , and to pass towards the point of the island , and to shape our course towards the coast of the firm land , to view the situation thereof . and as we pass the island , and be betwixt it and the main , then northwest be a contrary wind begin to blow , which increase so by degree , that we be constrain to let fall the bonnet of our sail , to save they , strike they very low .
