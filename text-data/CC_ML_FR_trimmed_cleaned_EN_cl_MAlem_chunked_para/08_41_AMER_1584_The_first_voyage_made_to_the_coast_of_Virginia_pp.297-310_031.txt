love , and faithful , void of all guile and treason , and such as live after the manner of the golden age . the people only care how to defend themselves from the cold in their short winter , and to feed themselves with such meat as the soil afford : there meat be very well sodden and they make broth very sweet and savoury : their vessel be earthen pot , very large , white and sweet , their dish be wooden platter of sweet timber : within the place where they feed be their lodging , and within that their idol , which their i dole . they worship , of who they speak incredible thing .
