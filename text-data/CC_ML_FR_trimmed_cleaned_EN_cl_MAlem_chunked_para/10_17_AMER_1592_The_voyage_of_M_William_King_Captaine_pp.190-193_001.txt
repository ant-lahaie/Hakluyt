canary island , where we land threescore man , and fetch a caravel out of a harbour on the south side , and from a small island we take a demy - canon of brass in despite of the inhabitant , which play upon we with their small shot at our first land : of who we slay three ; and give they the repulse . Thence we go to the grand 190 Canaria , where we board a bark lie at anchor : out of which we be drive by great store of shot from the island . from thence we direct our course for the west Indies , and fall with the isle of Dominica about the ten of April .
