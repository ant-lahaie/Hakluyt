take in two butt of water which we have spend . during the space of these eight day we seek to make sail two or three time , but as we go out a little beyond the point of this isle , we find the wind so boisterous and contrary , and the sea so grow , that of force we be constrain to return under the succour of the island , and often time we be in great fear that we shall not be able to get in thither again . during this time that we can not proceed on our journey , we employ our self in catch a few fish for the Lent . from Shrovesunday be
