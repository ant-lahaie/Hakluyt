fair house of grey friar , howbeit we see none of they . here we be tell by the Spaniard in the town , that we have not pass fifteen english mile from thence to Mexico , whereof we be all very joyful and glad , hope that when we come thither , we shall either be relieve , and set free out of bond , or else be quick dispatch out of our life : for see our self thus carry bind from place to place , although some use we courteous , yet can we never joy , nor be merry till we may perceive our self set free from that bondage , either by death or otherwise .
