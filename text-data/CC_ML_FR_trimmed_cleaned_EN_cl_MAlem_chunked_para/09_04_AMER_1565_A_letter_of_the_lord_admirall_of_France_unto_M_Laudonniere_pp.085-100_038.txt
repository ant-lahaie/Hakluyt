next day morning , be scarce able to draw my breath any more , i betake i to my prayer with the soldier which be with i , who name be John du chemin : for i feel my self so feeble , that i be afraid i shall die sudden : and in truth if he have not embrace i in both his arm , and so hold i up , it have not be possible to save i . after we have make a end of our prayer , i hear a voice , which in my judgement be one of they which i have send , which be over against the ship and call for the ship boat
