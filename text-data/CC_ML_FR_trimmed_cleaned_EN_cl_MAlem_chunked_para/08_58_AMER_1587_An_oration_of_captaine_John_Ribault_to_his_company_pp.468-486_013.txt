so w | sejy your charge , and govern so modest your small company which i leave you , which with so good cheer remain under your obedience , that i never have occasion but to commend you , and to recount unto the king ( as i be desirous ) the faithful service which before we all you undertake to do he in his new France : and you companion , ( quoth he to the soldier ) i beseech you also to esteem of captain Albert as if he be my self that stay here with you , yield he that obedience which a true soldier owe unto his general and captain , live as brethren one with another
