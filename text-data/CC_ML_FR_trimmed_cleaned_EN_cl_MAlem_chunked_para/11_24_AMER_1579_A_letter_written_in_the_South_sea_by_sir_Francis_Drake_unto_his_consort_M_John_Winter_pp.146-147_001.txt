de Anton , i pray you pay they double the value for it , which i will satisfy again , and command your man not to do she any hurt : and what composition or agreement we have make , at my return into England i will by God help perform , although i be in doubt that this letter will never come to your hand : notwithstanding i be the man i have promise to be : beseech God , the saviour of all the world , to have we in his keep , to who only i give all honour , praise and glory . what i have write , be not only to you m . winter , but also to m . Thomas , m . Charles
