as the rain water which do fall from the mountain may do hurt unto the city , there at the foot of the mountain we will make a great pond to receive in all the water which do fall from the mountain , and so from thence to go into the sea , as more at large your majesty may see by my platform . if it will please your majesty , it be good that the city of number de Dios may be bring and build in this harbour : it will not be very chargeable unto the citizen by reason that all their house be make of timber , and they may benefit themselves with the same again ,
