the rudder of the say ship , which they look for every day . this band of man shoot at we from the shore with their musket , but hit none of we , and we shoot at they again : they also man a frigate and send it out after our boat to have take we , but we with sail and oar go from they : and when they perceive that they can not fetch we , but that they must come within danger of the ordinance of our ship , they stand in with the shore again and land their man , and present send their frigate about the point , but whether we know not .
