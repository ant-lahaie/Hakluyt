it must be in one of four place , or else not at all . and further i can assure you upon the peril of my life , that this voyage may be perform without further charge , nay with certain profit to the adventurer , if i may have but your favour in the action . i hope i shall find favour with you to see your card i pray God it be so true as the card shall be which i will bring you : and i hope in God , that your skill in navigation shall be gaineful unto you , although at the first it have not prove so . and thus with my humble commendation i commit you to God , desire no long to live , than i shall be you most faithful to command . Exon this fourteenth of October . 1586 . you to command John Davis .
