follow my way , till i come within sight of Cevola , which be situate on a plain at the foot of a round hill , and make show to be a fair city , and be better seat than any that i have see in these part . the house be build in order , accord as the indian tell i , all make of stone with diverse story , and flat roof , as far as i can discern from a mountain , whither i ascend to view the city . the people be somewhat white , they wear apparel , and lie in bed , their weapon be bow , they have emrald and other jewel ,
