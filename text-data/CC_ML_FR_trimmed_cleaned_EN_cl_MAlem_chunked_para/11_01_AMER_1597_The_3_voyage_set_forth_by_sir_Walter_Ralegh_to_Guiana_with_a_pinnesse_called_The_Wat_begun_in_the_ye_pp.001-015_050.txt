we make the island of Flores and Corvo : and the eight and twenty of June we make the lisart , and that night come all safe to Plymmouth , bless be God . between the isle of Barbuda in the west Indies and England we have three mighty storm , many calm , and some contrary wind . and upon the fourteen of June 1597 , there be diverse whale play about our pinnace , one of they cross our stem , and go under , rub she back against our keel : but by none of all these we sustain any loss . thank be to he that govern all thing . write by master Thomas Masham .
