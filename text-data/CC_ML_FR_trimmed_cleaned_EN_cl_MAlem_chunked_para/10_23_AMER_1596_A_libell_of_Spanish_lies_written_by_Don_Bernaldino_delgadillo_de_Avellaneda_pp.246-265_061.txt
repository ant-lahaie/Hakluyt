kingdom wherein we abide be enemy ( by reason of which there be no mean in either of they , to maintain that i have write ) let he make choice of any indifferent kingdom of equal distance from either realm , and i will there be ready to maintain as much as i have write : but if by my employment into France i be so stay by her majesty commandments , that i can out of that realm meet he in any other , i can see why he shall take any exception to that , consider the equality of the place , and that the army of both our prince be there resident .
