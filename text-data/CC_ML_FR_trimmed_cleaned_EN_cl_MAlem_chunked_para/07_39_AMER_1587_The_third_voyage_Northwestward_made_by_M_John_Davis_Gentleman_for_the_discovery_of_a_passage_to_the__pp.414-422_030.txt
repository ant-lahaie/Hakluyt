at Southwest . the 17 we meet a ship at sea , and as far as we can judge it be a biskaine : we think she go a fish abundance of for whale ; for in 52 degree or thereabouts we see very whale in m d € et £€ s . < # e ’ the 18 be fair , with a good gale at west . the 19 fair also , with much wind at west and by south . they arrive at Dartmouth the 15 of September . and thus after much variable weather and change of wind we arrive the 15 of September in Dartmouth anno 1587 , give thank to God for our safe arrival .
