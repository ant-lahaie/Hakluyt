at saint Lucar in Andaluzia : that before the say year one Thomas Tison a Englishman have find the way to the west Indies , and be there resident : unto who the aforesaid m . Nicolas Thorne send armour and other commodity specify in the letter aforesaid . This Thomas Tison ( so far as i can conjecture ) may seem to have be some secret factor for m . thorn and other english merchant in those remote part ; whereby it be probable that some of our merchant have a kind of trade to the west Indies even in those ancient time and before also : neither do i see any reason why the Spaniard shall debar we from it at this present .
