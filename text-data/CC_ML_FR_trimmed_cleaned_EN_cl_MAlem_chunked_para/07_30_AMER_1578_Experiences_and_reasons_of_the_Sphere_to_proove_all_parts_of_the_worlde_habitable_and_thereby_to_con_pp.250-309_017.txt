if they be unequal and oblique , the heat be the less , as towards both pole , which reason be very good and substantiali : for the perpendicular beam reflect and reverberate in themselves , so that the heat be double , every beam strike twice , and by unite be multiply , and continue strong in form of a column . but in our latitude of 50 . and 60 . degree , the sun beam descend oblique and slant wise , and so strike but once and depart , and therefore our 255 heat be cause by two mean that be by his manner of angle and by his continuance . note this reason . heat be
