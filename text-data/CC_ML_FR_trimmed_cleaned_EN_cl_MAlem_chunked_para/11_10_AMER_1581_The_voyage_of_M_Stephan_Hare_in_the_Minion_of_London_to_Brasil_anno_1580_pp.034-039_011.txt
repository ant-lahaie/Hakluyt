we arrive at saint Sebastian the 15 . day , and there shift our ballast , and have in stone , and hail our ship a ground to stop our leak , and carry our cask a shore to be hoop for water , which indeed may better have be do in Santos , before the Ministrador come thither : yet we finish all thing pertain to our ship , by the 22 . of this month , at saint Sebastian . the first day of July Thomas Babington come aboard with William euet , in our pinnace , and the rest of our man that go for they : but there be no pilot bring accord to promise to carry we to Baya .
