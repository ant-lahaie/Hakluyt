with who before you will inherit gold , you will loose gold , for which you loose your soul ; you that choose nought for right , but certainty , and fear that valour will get only blow , place you faith in incredulity . sit till you see a wonder , virtue rich : till honour have gold , rob gold of honour , till as man hate desert that get nought , they loathe all get that deserve not aught ; and use you gold - made man as dregs of man ; and till your poison soul , like spider lurk in sluttish chin eke , in mist of cobweb hide your foggy body and your dunghill pride . o
