to the full from the city of saint Michael : and though there be but the ten part of those thing , it be a great matter . herewithal i have send your lordship a letter , which i receive from the say father : the Indians tell i , that all the people of the country do great reverence he : and i believe he may travel many league far in that sort . he say , that if he find any good country , he will write to i thereof : i will not go thither without inform your lordship of my journey . i hope in God , that by one way or other we shall discover some good thing .
