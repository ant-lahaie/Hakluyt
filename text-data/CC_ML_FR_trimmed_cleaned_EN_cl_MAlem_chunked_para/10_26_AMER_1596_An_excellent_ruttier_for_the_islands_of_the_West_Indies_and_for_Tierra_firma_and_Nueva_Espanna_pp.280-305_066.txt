thou must do until thou bring thy self into the chanel . and if be in the chanel thou find the wind large , thou shall stir Northeast , with a care to go clean off the shold of the mimbre or the osiar . and if be in the chanel thou meet with the wind at north , than thou must turn with a little sail 4 . glass one way , and 4 . another , as thou think good . and if thou can not bear sail , than thou may go with all thy sail down , except when thou will cast about , thou may loose some small sail to wind thy ship . i
