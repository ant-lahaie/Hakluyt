: we believe , that perfect wisdom in this mobility of all human affair , refuse not with any price to purchase safety : and we just do acknowledge that the castilian from bare legged mountainer have attain to their greatness by labour and industrie * to sleep then , because it cost nothing ; to embrace the present time , because it flatter we with deceitful contentment ; and to kiss security , say , what evil happen unto we ? be the plain high way to a fearful downfall : from which the lord in his mercy deliver we , and give we a understand heart , in time to see , and to seek that , which belong unto our peace .
