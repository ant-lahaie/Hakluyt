birth off . and if thou chance to be benight when thou fall with the bay , and will go into the bay , thou shall carry thy lead in thy hand , and be sound : and find thy self in rocky ground , thou shall steer north because of shun the puercos : and yet give they not thediamant . too great a birth because of the diamant , and so thou may go in , sound when thou think good . And be benight and then not east and west with the bay , and if thou do not go into it , then make the large board thou can keep off till day . the canary .
