the second discovery thereof . the english voyage historic of Messer Nicolas and Messer Antonio Zeni ( which for some few respect may perhaps be call in question ) i have here annex the judgement of that famous cosmographer Abraham Ortelius , or rather the yield and submit of his judgement thereunto : who in his theatrum orbis , folio 6. next before the map of Mar deal Zur , borrow proof and authority out of this relation , to show that the north-east part of America call Estotiland , and in the original always affirm to be a island , be about the year 1390 discover by the aforesaid venetian gendeman Messer Antonio Zeno , above 100 year before ever Christopher Columbus set sail for those western region ; and that the northern sea be even then sail by our european pilot through the help of the loadstone : with diverse other particular concern the custom , religion and wealth of the southern Americans , which be most evidendy confirm by all the late and modern spanish history of Nueva Espanna and Peru. a nd here i shall not ( as i suppose ) commit any great inconvenience , or absurdity , in add unto this history of the new world , certain particular as touch the first discovery thereof , not common know . which discovery all the writer of our time ascribe ( and that not unworthy ) unto Christopher Columbus . for by he it be in a manner first discover , make know , and profitable communicate unto the christian world , in the year of our lord 1492. howbeit i find that the north part thereof call Estotiland , ( which most of all extend towards our Europe and the island of the same , namely , Groneland , island , and Frisland , ) be long ago find out by certain fisher of the isle of Frisland , drive by tempest upon the shore thereof : and be afterward about the year 1390 discover a new , by one Antonio Zeno a gentleman of Venice ; which sail thither under the conduct of Zichmni king of the say isle of Frisland , a prince in those part of great 464 Nicholas and Antonio Zeno a.d. c . 1380-90 . valour , and renown for his martial exploit and victory . of which expedition of Zichmni there be extant in italian certain collection or abridgement gather by Francisco Marcolino out of the letter of m. Nicolo and Antonio Zeni two gentleman of Venice which live in those part . out of which collection i do add concern the description of Estotiland aforesaid these particular follow . Estotiland ( say he ) abound with all thing necessary for mankind . in the mid thereof stand a exceed high mountain , from which issue four river that moisten all the country . the inhabitant be witty and most expert in all mechanical art . they have a kind of peculiar language and letter . howbeit in this king library be preserve certain latin book , which they understand not , be perhaps leave there not many year before by some Europeans , which traffic thither . they have all kind of metal ; but especial gold , wherewith they mighty abound . they traffic with the people of Groneland : from whence they fetch skin , pitch and brimstone . the inhabitant report that towards the south , there be region abound with gold , and very populous : they have many and huge wood , from whence they take timber for the build of ship and city , whereof and of castle there be great store . the use of the loadstone for navigation be unknown unto they . they make relation also of a certain region towards the south , call Drogio , which Drogio . be inhabit by cannibal , unto who man flesh be delicate meat : whereof be destitute they live by fish , which they use very much . beyond this be large region , and as it be a new world : but the people be barbarous and go naked : howbeit against the cold they cloth themselves in beast skin . Theise have no kind of metal : and they live by hunt . their weapon be certain long staff with sharp point , and bow . they wage war one against another . they have governor , and obey certain law . but from hence seven 465 2 g more towards the south the climate be much more temperate : and there be city , and temple of idol , unto who they sacrifice live man , who flesh they afterward devour . Theise nation have the use of silver and gold . thus much of this tract of land out of the aforesaid collection or abridgement . wherein this also be worthy the observation , that even then our european pilot sail those sea by the help of the loadstone . for concern the use thereof in navigation , i suppose there be not to be find a more ancient testimony . and these thing i have annex the rather unto this table of Mar deal Zur ; consider that none of those author which have write the history of the new world , have in any part of their write , mention one word thereof . hitherto Ortelius . end of volume Vii .
