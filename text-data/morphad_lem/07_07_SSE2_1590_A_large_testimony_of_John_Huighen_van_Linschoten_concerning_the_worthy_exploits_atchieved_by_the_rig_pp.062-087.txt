Plymouth the 24 of October . 1591. your worship love friend Robert Flicke . a large testimony of John Huighen van linschoten Hollander , concern the worthy exploit achieve by the right honourable the earl of Cumberland , by sir Martine Frobisher , sir Richard Greenvile , and diverse other English captain , about the isle of the azore , and upon the coast of Spain and Portugal , in the year 1589 , 1590 , 1591 , etc record in his excellent discourse of voyage to the east and west Indies , cap . 96. 97. and 99 he 22 of July 1589 about evening , be by the island of Flores and Corvo , we perceive 3 ship that make towards we , which come from under the land , which put we in great fear : for they come close by our admiral , and shoot diverse time at he , and at another ship of our company , whereby we perceive they to be Englishman , for they bear a english flag upon their 62 linschoten’s large testimony a.d. 1589-91 . main top , but none of they show to be above 60 ton in greatness . about evening they follow after we , and all night bear lantern with candle burn in they at their sterne , although the moon shine . the same night pass hard by the island of Fayal , the next day be between the island of S. George that lie on our right hand , and the small island call Graciosa on our left hand , we espy the 3 english ship still follow we you take counsel together , whereof one sail backward , think that some other ship have come after we without company , and for a time be out of sight , but it be not long before it come again to you other two , wherewith they take counsel and come all 3 together against our ship , because we lay in the lee of all our ship , and have you island of S. George on the one side in stead of a sconce , think to deal so with we , that in you end we shall be constrain to run upon the shore , whereof we want not much , and in that manner with their [ ii two . 179. ] flag open display , come lusty towards we , sound their trumpet , and sail at the least three time about we , beat we with musket and caliver , and some great piece , and do we not hurt in the body of our ship , but spoil all our sail and rope , and to conclude , we be so plague by they , that no man dare put forth his head , and when we shoot off a piece , we have at the least a hour work to lade it again , whereby we have so great a noise and cry in the ship , as if we have all be cast away , whereat the english man themselves begin to mock we , and with a thousand jest word call unto we . in the mean time the other ship hoist all their sail , and do the best they can to sail to the island of Tercera , not look once behind they to help we , doubt they shall come too late thither , not care for we , but think themselves to have do sufficient so they save their own stake , whereby it may easy be see what company they keep one with the other , and what order be among they . in the end the english man perceive small advantage against we , ( little know in what case and fear we be , as also because we be not far from Tercera ) leave we , which make we not a little to rejoice , as think our self to be rise from death to life , although we be not well assure , neither yet void of fear till we lay in the road before Tercera , and under the safety of the Portugal fort , and that we may get thither in good time we make all the sail we can : on the other side we be in great doubt , because we know not what they do in the island , nor whither they be our friend or enemy , and we doubt so much the more , because we find no man of war nor any caravel of advice from portingal , as we make our account to do , that may convoy we from thence , or give we advise , as in that country ordinary they use to do : and because the english - man have be so victorious in those part , it make we suspect that it go not well with Spain : they of the island of Tercera be in no less fear than we , for see our fleet , they think we to be Englishman , and that we come to overrun the island , because the 3. Englishmen have bind up their flag , and come in company with we : for the which cause the island send out two caravel that lie there with advise from the king , for the indian ship that shall come thither . those caravel come to view we , and perceive what we be , make after we , whereupon . the english ship leave we , and make towards they , because the caravel think they to be friend , and shun they not , as suppose they to be of our company , but we shoot four or five time and make sign unto they that they shall make towards the island , which they present do . the Englishman perceive that , do put forward into the sea , and so the caravel hoard we tell we that the man of the island be all in arm , as have receive advice from Portugal , that sir Francis Drake be in readiness , and will come unto those island . they likewise bring we news of the overthrow of the spanish fleet before England , and that the english man have be before the gate of Lisbon : whereupon the king give we commandment that we shall put into the island of Tercera , and there lie under the safety of the castle until we receive further advise what we shall do , or whether we shall sail : for that they think it too dangerous for we to go to Lisbon . those news put our fleet in great fear , and make we look upon each other not know what to say , as be dangerous for they to put into the road , because it lie open to the sea : so that the indian ship , although they have express commandment from the king , yet they dare not anchor there , but only use to come thither , and to lie to and fro , send their boat on land to fetch such necessary as they want , without anker : but be by necessity compel thereunto , as also by the king commandment , and for that we understand the earl of Cumberland not to be far from those island with certain ship of war , we make necessity a virtue , and enter the road , anchor close under the castle , stay for advise and order from the king , to perform our voyage , it be then the 24. of July , and saint James day . the day before the earl of Cumberland with 6. or 7. ship of war , sail by the island of Tercera , and to their great good fortune pass out of sight , so that they dispatch themselves in all haste , and for the more security , take with they 4. hundred Spaniard , of those that lie in garrison in the island , and with they they sail towards Lisbon , have a good wind : so that within 11 day after they arrive in the river of Lisbon with great gladness and triumph : for if they have stay but one day long before they have enter the river , they have all be take by captain drake , who with 40 ship come before Cascais at the same time that the indian ship , cast anchor in the river of Lisbon , be guard thither by diverse galley . while i remain in Tercera , the earl of Cumb. come to saint marie , to take in fresh water , and some other seven 65 e a » . 1589-91 . victual : but the inhabitant will not suffer he to have it , but wound both himself and diverse of his man , whereby they be force to depart without have any thing there . the earl of Cumberland while i lie in Tercera , come unto the isle of Graciosa , where himself in person , with seven or eight in his company go on land , ask [ ii two . 180. ] certain beast , hen , and other victual , with wine and fresh water , which they willing give he , and therewith he depart from thence , without do they any hurt : for the which the inhabitant thank he , and commend he for his courtesy , and keep of his promise . the same time that the earl of Cumberland be in the island of Graciosa , he come likewise to Fayall , where at the first time that he come , they begin to resist he , but by reason of some controversy among they , they let he land , where he raze the castle to the ground , and sink all their ordinance in the sea , take with he certain caravel and ship that lie in the road , with provision of all thing that he want : and therewith depart again to sea . whereupon the king cause the principali actor therein to be punish , and send a company of soldier thither again , which go out of Tercera , with all kind of warlike munition , and great shot , make the foretresse up again , the better to defend the island , trust no more in the Portugal . the 99 chapter . the nine of October 1589. there arrive in Tercera fourteen ship that come from the spanish Indies , lade with cochenile , hide , gold , silver , pearl , and other rich ware . they be fifty in company , when they depart out of the haven of Havana , whereof , in their come out of the channel , eleven sink in the same channel by foul weather , the rest by a storm be scatter and separate one from the other . the next day there come another ship of the same company , that sail close under the island , so to get into the road : where she meet with a english ship that have not above three cast piece , and the Spaniard 12. they fight a long time together , which we be in the island may stand and behold : whereupon the governor of Tercera send two boat of musketeer to help the ship : but before they can come at she , the english ship have shoot she under water , and we see she sink into the sea with all her sail up , and not any thing see of she above the water . the Englishman with their boat save the captain and about thirty other with he , but not one pennyworth of the good , and yet in the ship there be at the least to the value of two hundred thousand ducat in gold , silver , and pearl , the rest of the man be drown which might-be about fifty person , among the which be some friar and woman , which the Englishman will not save . those that they have save they set on land : and then they sail away . the seven and twenty of the same month , the say fourteen ship have refresh themselves in the island depart from Tercera towards Seville , and come upon the coast of Spain they be take by the english ship that lie there to watch for they , two only except which escape away , and the rest be whole carry into England . about the same time the earl of Cumberland with one of the queen ship , and five or six more , keep about those island and come oftentimes so close under the island , and to the road of Angra , that the people on land may easy tell all his man that he have aboard , and know such as walk on the hatch : they of the island not once shoot at they , although they may easy have do it , for they be within musket shoot both of the town and fort . in these place he continue for the space of two month , and sail round about the island , and land in Graciosa and Fayal , as in the description of those island i have already declare . here he take diverse ship and caravel , which he send into 67 England : so that those of the island dare not once put forth their head . at the same time about three or fbure day after the earl of Cumberland have be in the island of Fayal , and be depart from thence , there arrive in the say island of Fayal six indian ship , who generali be one Juan derive : and there they discharge in the hand 4 million of gold and silver . and have with all speed refresh their ship , fear the come of the Englishman they set sail , and arrive safe in saint Lucar , not meet with the enemy , to the great good luck of the Spaniard and hard fortune of the Englishman : for that within less than two day after the gold and silver be lade again into the spanish ship , the earl of Cumberland sail again by that island : so that it appear that God will not let they have it , for if they have once have sight thereof , without doubt it have be they , as the Spaniard themselves confess . in the month of November there arrive in Tercera two great ship , which be the admiral and viceadmiral of the fleet lade with silver , who with stormy weather be separate from the fleet , and have be in great torment and distress , and ready to sink : for they be force to use all their pump : so that they wish a thousand time to have meet with the Englishman to who they will willing have give their silver and all that ever they bring with they , only to save their life . and although the earl of Cumberland lie still [ ii two . 181. ] about those island , yet they meet not with he , so that after much pain and labour they get into the road before Angra , where with all speed they unlade and discharge above five million of silver , all in piece of 8 or 10 pound great : so that the whole key lie cover with plate and chest of silver , full of ryale of eight , most wonderful to behold , ( each million be ten hundred thousand ducat , ) beside pearl , gold , and other stone , which be not register . the admiral and chief commander of those ship and fleet call Alvero 68 Flores de quiniones be sick of the neapolitan disease , and be bring to land , whereof not long after he die in Sivillia . he bring with he the king broad seal and full authority to be generali and chief commander upon the sea , and of all fleet or ship , and of all place and island , or land wheresoever he come : whereupon the governor of Tercera do he great honour , and between they it be conclude , perceive the weakness of their ship , and the danger of the Englishman , that they will send the ship empty with soldier to convey they , either to Seville or Lisbon , where they can first arrive , with advise unto his majesty of all that have pass , and that he will give order to fetch the silver with good and safe convoy . whereupon the say Alvero Flores stay there , under colour of keep the silver , but special because of his disease , and for that they be afraid of the Englishman . This Alvero Flores have alone for his own part above 50000 ducat in pearl which he show unto we , and seek to sell they or barter they with we for spice or lil of exchange . the say two ship set sail with 3 or 4 hundred man , as well soldier as other that come with they out of India , and be at sea have a storm , wherewith the admiral burst and sink in the sea , and not one man save . the vice-admiral cut down her mast , and run the ship on ground hard by Setuval , where it burst in piece , some of the man save themselves by swim , that bring the news , but the rest be drown . in the same month there come two great ship out of the spanish Indies , and be within half a mile of the road of Tercera , they meet with a english ship , which , after they have fight long together , take they both . about 7 or 8 month before , there have be a english ship in Tercera , that under the name of a Frenchman come to traffic in the island , there to lade woad , and be discover be both ship and good confiscate to the king use , and all the man keep prisoner : yet go they up and down the street to get their live , by labour like slave , be in deed as safe in that island , as if they have be in prison . but in the end upon a Sunday , all the sailor go down behind the hill call Bresil : where they find a fisherboat , whereinto they get and row into the sea to the earl of cumberland ship , which to their great fortune chance at that time to come by the island , and anchor with his ship about half a mile from the road of Angra , hard by two small island , which lie about a base shoot from the island and be full of goat , deer and sheep , belong to the inhabitant of the island of Tercera . those sailor know it well , and thereupon they row unto they with their boat , and lie at anchor that day , they fetch as many goat and sheep as they have need of : which those of the town and of the island well see and behold , yet dare not once go forth : so there remain no more on land but the master and the merchant of the say english ship . this master have a brother in law dwell in England , who have news of his brother imprisonment in Tercera , get licence of the queen of England to set forth a ship , therewith to see if he can recover his loss of the Spaniard by take some of they , and so to redeem his brother that lie prisoner in Tercera , and he it be that take the two spanish ship before the town , the master of the ship aforesaid stand on the shore by i , and look upon they , for he be my great acquaintance . the ship be take that be worth 300 thousand ducat , he send all the man on land save only two of the principali gentleman , which he keep aboard thereby to ransom his brother : and send the pilot of one of the indian ship that be take , with a letter to the governor of Tercera : wherein he write that he shall deliver he his brother , and he will send the 2 gentleman on land : if not , he will sail with they into England , as indeed he do , because the governor will not do it , say linschoten’s large testimony a.d. 1589-91 . that the gentleman may make that suit to the king of Spain himself . this spanish pilot we bid to supper with we , and the Englishman likewise , where he show we all the manner of their fight , much commend the order and manner of the Englishman fight , as also their courteous use of he : but in the end the english pilot likewise steal away in a french ship , without pay any ransom as yet . in the month of Januarie 1590 there arrive one ship alone in Tercera , that come from the spanish Indies , and bring news that there be a fleet of a hundred ship which put out from the firm land of the spanish Indies , and by a storm be drive upon the coast call Florida , where they be all cast away , she have only escape , wherein there be great riches , and many man lose , as it may well be think : so that they make their account , that of 220 ship that for certain be know to have put out of Nova Spagna , saint Domingo , Havana , Capo verde , Brasilia , Guinea , etc [ ii two . 182. ] in the year 1589. to sail for Spain and Portugal , there be not above 14 or 15 of they arrive there in safety , all the rest be either drown , burst or take . in the same month of January there arrive in Tercera 15 or 16 ship that come from Sivil , which be most flyboat of the low country , and some briton that be arrest in Spain : these come full of soldier , and well appoint with munition , to lade the silver that lie in Tercera , and to fetch Alvares de flores by the king commandment into Spain . and because that time of the year there be always storm about those hand , therefore they dare not enter into the road of Tercera , for that as then it blow so great a storm that some of their ship that have anchor be force to cut down their mast , and be in danger to be lose : and among the rest a ship of Biscaie run against the land and be strike in piece , but all the man save themselves . the other ship be force to keep the sea and separate themselves one from the other , where wind and weather will drive they until the 15 of march for that in all that time they can not have one day of fair weather to anchor in , whereby they endure much misery , curse both the silver and the hand . this storm be pass , they chance to meet with a small english ship of about 40 ton in bigness , which by reason of the great wind can not bear all her sail : so they set upon she and take she , and with the english flag in their admiral stern , they come as proud into the haven as if they have conquer all the realm of England : but as the admiral that bear the english flag upon her stern be enter into the road , there come by chance two english ship by the hand that pay she so well for her pain , that they be force to cry misericordia , and without all doubt have take she , if she have be but a mile further in the sea : but because she get under the fortress , which also begin to shoot at the Englishman , they be force to leave she , and to put further into the sea , have slay five or six of the Spaniard . the Englishman that be take in the small ship be put under hatch , and couple in bolt , and after they have be prisoner 3 or 4 day , there be a spanish ensign-bearer in the ship that have a brother slay in the fleet that come for England , who as then mind to revenge his death , and withal to show his manhood on the english captive that be in the english ship , which they have take , as be aforesaid , take a poniard in his hand and go down under the hatch , where find the poor Englishmen sit in bolt , with the same poniard he stab six of they to the heart : which two other of they perceive , clasp each other about the middle , because they will not be murder by he , and throw themselves into the sea and there be drown . this act be of all the Spaniard much dislike and very ill take , so that they carry the Spaniard prisoner unto Lisbon , where be arrive , the king of Spain will he shall be send into England , that the queen of England may use he as she think good : which sentence his friend by intreaty get to be reverse , notwithstanding he command he shall without all favour be behead : but upon a good Friday the Cardinali go to mass , all the captain and commander make so great entreaty for he , that in the end they get his pardon . this i think good to note , that man may understand the bloody and dishonest mind of the Spaniard when they have man under their subjection . the same two english ship which follow the spanish admiral till he have get the fort of Tercera , as i say before , put into the sea , where they meet with another spanish ship be of the same fleet , that have likewise be scatter by the storm and be only miss , for the rest lie in the road . this small ship the Englishman take , and send all the man on shore , not hurt any of they : but if they have know what have be do unto the foresay english captive , i believe they will soon have revenge themselves , as afterward many a innocent soul pay for it . this ship thus take by the Englishman , be the same that be take and confiscate in the hand of Tercera by the Englishman that get out of the hand in a fisher boat ( as t said before ) and be sell unto the Spaniard that as then come from the Indies , wherewith they sail to saint Lucar , where it be also arrest by the duke , and appoint to go in company to fetch the silver in Tercera , because it be a ship that sail well , but among the Spaniard fleet it be the mean of the company . by this mean it be take from the Spaniard and carry into England , and the owner have it again when they least thought of it . the 19 of march the aforesaid ship be 19 in number , set sail , have lade the king silver , and receive in Alvero flores de quiniones , with his company and good provision of necessary , munition and 73 A.D. i589-9i . soldier that be full resolve ( as they make show ) to fight valiant to the last man before they will yield or lose their riches : and although they set their course for saint Lucar , the wind drive they unto Lisbon , which ( as it seem ) be willing by his force to help they , and to bring they thither in safety , although Alvero de flores , both against the wind and weather will perforce have sail to saint Lucar , but be constrain by the wind and importunity of the sailor that protest they will require their loss and damage of he , he be content to sail to Lisbon : from whence the silver be by land carry unto Sivil . at cape S. Vincent there lay a fleet of 20 english ship to watch for the armada , so that if they have put into saint Lucar , they have fall right into their hand , which if the wind have serve they have do . and therefore they may say that the wind have lend they a happy voyage : for if the Englishman have meet with they , they have sure be in great danger , and possible but few of they have escape , by reason of the fear wherewith they be possess , because fortune or rather God be whole against they : which be a sufficient cause to make the Spaniard out of heart , and to the contrary to give the Englishman more courage , and to make they bold for that they be victorious , stout and valiant : and see all their enterprise do take so good effect , that thereby they be become lord and master of the sea , and need care for no man , as it well appear by this brief discourse . the 7 of August 1590. a navy of english ship be see before Tercera , be 20 in number , and 5 of they the queen ship : their generali be one Martin Frobisher , as we after have intelligence . they come purposely to watch for the fleet of the spanish Indies , and for the indian ship , and the ship of the country in the west : which put the hander in great fear , special those of Fayal , for that the Englishman send a trumpet to the governor to ask certain wine , flesh , and other victual for their money and good friendship . they of Fayal do not only refuse to give ear unto they , but with a shot kill their messenger or trumpeter : which the Englishman take in evil part , send they word that they be best to look to themselves and stand upon their guard , for they mean to come and visit they whether they will or no . the governor make they answer , that he be there in the behalf of his majesty of Spain , and that he will do his best to keep they out , as he be bind : but nothing be do , although they of Fayal be in no little fear , send to Tercera for aid , from whence they have certain bark with powder and munition for war , with some biscuit and other necessary provision . the 30 of August we receive very certain news out of Portugal , that there be 80 ship put out of the groin lade with victual , munition , money and soldier , to go for Britain to aid the catholic and leaguer of France against the king of Navarre . at the same time two Netherlands hulk come out of Portugal ! to Tercera be half the sea over , meet with 4 of the queen ship , their generali be sir John Hawkins , that stay they , but let they go again without do they any harm . the netherlander report , that each of the queen ship have 80 piece of ordinance , and that captain Drake lie with 40 ship in the english channel watch for the army of the groin : and likewise that there lay at the cape S. Vincent ten other english ship , that if any ship escape from the hand , they may take they . Theise tiding put the hander in great fear , lest if they fail of the spanish fleet and get nothing by they , that than they will fall upon the hand , because they will not return empty home , whereupon they hold strait watch , send advice unto the king what news they hear . the first of September there come to the hand of S. Michael a Portugal ship out of the haven of phernambuck in Brasile , which bring news that the admiral of the Portugal fleet that come from India , have 75 miss the hand of S. Helena , be of necessity constrain to put into Phernambuck , although the king have express under a great penalty forbid he so to do , because of the worm that there do spoil the ship . the same ship wherein Bernardin Ribero be admiral the year before 1589. sail out of Lisbon into the Indies , with 5 ship in her company , whereof but 4 get into India , the 5 be never hear of , so that it be think to be cast away : the other four return safe again into Portugal , though the admiral be much spoil , because he meet with two english ship that fight long with he , and slay many of his man , but yet he escape from they . the 5 of the same month there arrive in Tercera a caravel of the hand of Corvo , and bring with her 50 man that have be spoil by the Englishman who have set they on shore in the hand of Corvo , be take out of a ship that come from the spanish Indies , they bring tiding that the Englishman have take 4 more of the indian ship , and a caravel with the king of Spain letter of advice for the ship come out of the Portugal Indies , and that with those which they have take , they be at the least 40 english ship together , so y* not one - bark escape they , but fall into their hand , and that therefore the Portugal ship come out of India dare not put into the hand , but take their course under 40 and 42 degree , and from thence sail to Lisbon , shun likewise the cape S. Vincent , otherwise they can not have have a prosperous journey of it , for that as than the sea be full of english ship . whereupon the king advise the fleet lie in Havana in the spanish Indies ready to come for Spain , that they shall stay there all that year till the next year , because of the great danger they may fall into by the Englishman , which be no small charge , and hindrance to the fleet , for that the ship that lie there do consume themselves , and in a manner eat up one another , by reason of the great number of people , together with the scarcity of all thing , 76 so that many ship choose rather one by one to adventure [ ii two . 184. . ] themselves alone to get home , than to stay there : all which fall into the Englishman hand , whereof diverse of great havoc the man be bring into Tercera , for that a whole °f^pantariis-day we can see nothing else , but spoil man set on shore , some out of one ship , some out of another , that pity it be to see all of they curse the Englishman and their own fortune , with those that have be the cause to provoke the Englishman to fight , and complain of the small remedy and order take therein by the king of Spain officer . the 19 of the same month there come to Tercera a caravel of Lisbon , with one of the king officer , to cause the good that be save out of the ship which come from Malacca ( for you which we stay there ) to be lade and send to Lisbon . and at the same time there put out of the groin one don Alonso de Ba^an , with 40 great ship of war to come unto the hand , there to watch for the fleet of the spanish and Portugal Indies , and the good of the Malacca ship be lade , they be to convoy they all together into the river of Lisbon : but be certain day at sea , always have a contrary wind , they can not get unto the hand , only two of they that be scatter from the fleet , arrive at Tercera , and not find the fleet , they present return to seek they : in the mean time the king change his mind , and cause the fleet to stay in India , as i say before : and therefore he send word unto don Alonso de Bassan , that he shall return again to the groin , which he present do ( without do any thing , nor once approach near the hand , save only the two foresay ship , for he well know that the Englishman lie by the hand of Corvo , but he will not visit they : and so he return to the haven the groin , whereby our good that come from Malacca be yet to ship , and truss up again , and force to stay a more fortunate time with patience perforce . the 23 of October there arrive in Tercera a caravel with advise out of Portugal , that of 5 ship which in the year 1590 be lade in Lisbon for the Indies , 4 of they be turn again to Portin . after they have be 4 month abroad , and that the admiral , wherein the viceroy call Mathias d’albukerk sail , have only get to India , as afterward news thereof be bring overland , have be at the least 11 month at sea and never see land , and come in great misery to Malacca . in this ship there die by the way 280 man , accord to a note by himself make , and send to the cardinal at Lisbon , with the name and surname of every man , together with a description of his voyage , and the misery they have endure , which be only do , because he will not lose the government of India : and for that cause he have swear either to lose his life , or to arrive in India , as in deed he do afterward , but to the great danger , loss and hindrance of his company , that be force to buy it with their life , and only for want of provision , as it may well be think : for he know full well that if he have return back again into Portugal as the other ship do , he shall have be cassier from his indian regiment , because the people begin already to murmur at he for his proud and lofty mind . and among other thing that show his pride the more , behind above the gallery of his ship he cause fortune to be paint , and his own picture w‘ a staff stand by she , as it be threaten fortune , with this posy , Quero que vencas , that be , i will have thou to overcome : which be read by the cardinal and other gentleman ( that to honour he bring he aboard his ship ) it be think to be a point of exceed folly : but it be no strange matter among the Portugal : for they above all other must of force let the fool peep out of their sleeve , special when they be in authority , for that i know the say Mathias d’albukerk in India , be a soldier and a captain , where he be esteem and account for one of the best of they , and much honour , and belove of all man , as behave himself courteous to every man , linschoten’s large testimony a.d. 1589-91 . whereby they all desire that he may be viceroy . but when he once have receive his patent with full power and authority from the king to be viceroy , he change so much from his former behaviour , that by reason of his pride , they all begin to fear and curse he , and that before he depart out of Lisbon , as it be often see in many man that be advance unto state and dignity . the 20 of Januarie 1591. there be news bring out of Portugal into Tercera , that the Englishman have take a ship that the king have send into the portugal-indy , wl advise to the viceroy for the return again of the 4 ship that shall have go to India , and because the ship be come back again , that ship be stuff and jade as full of good as possible it may be , have likewise in ready money 500 thousand ducat in royal of 8 , beside other ware . it depart from Lisbon in the month of November 1590. and meet with the Englishman , with who for a time it fight , but in the end it be take and carry into England with man and all , yet when they come there , the man be set at liberty , and return into Lisbon , where the captain be commit prisoner ; but he excuse himself and be release , with who i speak my self , and he make this report unto i . at the same time also they take a ship that come from the mine lade with gold , and 2 ship lade with pepper and spice that be to sail into Italy , the pepper only that be in they , be worth 170 thousand ducat : all these ship be carry into England , and make good prize . in the month of July 1591. there happen a earth - [ ii two . 185. ] quake in the hand of S. Michael , which continue from the 26 of July , to the 12 of August , in which time no man dare stay within his house but flee into the field , fast and pray with great sorrow , for that many of their house fall down , and a town call Villa Franca , be almost clean raze to the ground , all the cloister and house shake to the earth , and therein some people slay . the land in some place rise up , and the cliff remove from one place to another , and some hill be deface and make even with the ground . the earthquake be so strong , that the ship which lie in the road and on the sea , shake as if the world will have turn round : there spring also a fountain out of the earth , from whence for the space of 4 day , there flow a most clear water , and after that it cease . at the same time they hear such thunder and noise under the earth , as if all the devil in hell have be assemble together in that place , wherewith many die for fear . the hand of Tercera shake 4 time together , so that it seem to turn about , but there happen no misfortune unto it . earthquake be common in those hand , for about 20 year pass there happen another earthquake , wherein a high hill that lie by the same town of Villa Franca , fall half down , and cover all the town with earth , and kill many man . the 25 of August the king armada commi hang out of ferol arrive in Tercera be in all 30 ship , biskaine , Portugal and Spaniard , and 10 dutch flyboat that be arrest in Lisbon to serve the king , beside other small ship and pataxo , that come to serve as messenger from place to place , and to discover the sea . this navy come to stay for , and convoy the ship that shall come from the spanish Indies , and the flyboat be appoint in their return home , to take in the good that be save in the lose ship that come from Malacca , and to convoy they to Lisbon . the 13 of September the say armada arrive at the hand of Corvo , where the Englishman with about 16 ship as then lie , stay for the spanish fleet , whereof some or the most part be come , and there the english be in good hope to have take they . but when they perceive the king army to be strong , the admiral be the lord Thomas Howard , command his fleet not to fall upon they , nor any of they once to separate their ship from he , unless he give commission so to do : notwithstanding the viceadmiral sir Richard greenvil be in the ship call the revenge , go into the 80 spanish fleet , and shoot among they do they great hurt , and think the rest of the company will have follow , which they do not , but leave he there , and sail away : the cause why can not be know . which the Spaniard perceive , with 7 or 8 ship they board she , but she withstand they all , fight with they at the least 12 hour together and sink two of they , one be a new double flyboat of 600 ton , and admiral of the flyboat , the other a Biscain : but in the end by reason of the number that come upon she , she be take , but to their great loss : for they have lose in fight and by drown above 400 man , and of the english be slay about 100 , sir Richard greenvil himself be wound in his brain , whereof afterward he die . he be carry into the ship call S. Paul , wherein be the admiral of the fleet don Alonso de Ba^an : there his wound be dress by the spanish surgeon , but don Alonso himself will neither see he nor speak with he : all the rest of the captain and gentleman go to visit he , and to comfort he in his hard fortune , wonder at his courage and stout heart , for y‘ he show not any sign of faintness nor change of colour ; but feel the hour of death to approach , he speak these word in spanish , and say : here die i Richard greenvil with a joyful and quiet mind , for that i have end my life as a true soldier ought to do , that have fight for his country , queen , religion and honour , whereby my soul most joyful depart out of this body , and shall always leave behind it a everlasting fame of a valiant and true soldier that have do his duty as he be bind to do . when he have finish these or such other like word , he give up the ghost , with great and stout courage , and no man can perceive any true sign of heaviness in he . this sir Richard greenvil be a great and a rich gentleman in England , and have great yearly revenue of his own inheritance , but he be a man very unquiet in his mind , and great affect to war ; insomuch as of unto 81 F his own private motion he offer his service to the queen : he have perform many valiant act , and be great fear in these hand , and know of every man , but of nature very severe , so that his own people hate he for his fierceness , and speak very hardly of he : for when they first enter into the fleet or armada , they have their great sail in a readiness , and may possible enough have sail away , for it be one of the best ship for sail in England , and the master perceive that the other ship have leave they , and follow not after , command the great sail to be cut that they may make away : but sir Richard greenvil threaten both he and all the rest that be in the ship , y‘ if any man lay hand upon it , he will cause he to be hang , and so by that occasion they be compel to fight and in the end be take . he be of so hard a complexion , that as he continue among the spanish captain while they be at dinner or supper with he , he will carouse 3 or 4 glass of wine , and in a bravery take the glass be - [ ii two . 186. ] between his tooth and crash they in piece and swallow they down , so that oftentimes the blood run out of his mouth without any harm at all unto he : and this be tell i by diverse credible person that many time stand and behold he . the Englishman that be leave in the ship , as the captain of the soldier , the master and other be disperse into diverse of the spanish ship that have take they , where there have almost a new fight arise between the Biscains and the Portugal : while each of they will have the honour to have first board she , so that there grow a great noise and quarrel among they , one take the chief ensign , and the other the flag , and the captain and every one hold his own . the ship that have board she be altogether out of order , and break , and many of their man hurt , whereby they be compel to come into the island of Tercera , there to repair themselves : where be arrive , i and my chamber-fellow , to hear some news , go aboard one of the ship be a great Biscain , and one of the 12 apostle , who captain be call bartandono , that have be general of the Biscains in the fleet that go for England . he see we call we up into the gallery , where with great courtesy he receive we , be as then set at dinner with the english captain that sit by he , and have on a suit of black velvet , but he can not tell we any thing , for that he can speak no other language but English and latin , which bartandono also can a little speak . the english captain get licence of the governor that he may come on land with his weapon by his side , and be in our lodging with the Englishman that be keep prisoner in the hand , be of that ship whereof the sailor get away , as i say before . the governor of Tercera bid he to dinner , and show he great courtesy . the master likewise with licence of bartandono come on land and be in our lodging , and have at the least io or 12 wound , as well in his head as on his body , whereof after that be at sea between Lisbon and the hand he die . the captain write a letter , wherein he declare all the manner of the fight , and leave it with the english merchant that lie in our lodging , to send it to the lord admiral of England . this english captain come unto Lisbon , be there well receive and not any hurt do unto he , but with good convoy send to Setuval , and from thence sail into England with all the rest of the Englishman that be take prisoner . the spanish army stay at the hand of Corvo till the last of September , to assemble the rest of the fleet together , which in the end be to the number of 140 sail of ship partly come from India , and partly of the army , and be altogether ready to sail to Tercera in good company , there sudden rise so hard and cruel a storm , that those of the hand do afiirme , that in man memory there be never any such see or hear off " before : for it seem the sea will have swallow up the hand , the water mount high than the cliff , which be so high that it amass a man to behold they : but the sea reach above they , and live fish be throw upon the land . this storm continue not only a day or two with one wind , but 7 or 8 day continual , the wind turn round about in all place of the compass , at the lest twice or thrice during that time , and all alike , with a continual storm and tempest most terrible to behold , even to we that be on shore , much more than to such as be at sea : so that only on the coast and cliff of the hand of Tercera , there be above 12 ship cast away , and not only upon the one side , but round about it in every corner , whereby nothing else be hear but complain , cry , lament and tell , here be a ship break in piece against the cliff , and there another , and all the man drown : so that for the space of 20 day after the storm , they do nothing else but fish for dead man that continual come drive on the Thewracketf shore . among the rest be the english ship call they the revenge . revenge , that be cast away upon a cliff near to the hand of Tercera , where it break in a hundred piece and sink to the ground , have in her 70 man Galegos , Biscains , and other , with some of the captive Englishman , whereof but one be save that get up upon the cliff alive , and have his body and head all wound , and he be on shore bring we the news desire to be shrive , and thereupon present die . the revenge have in her diverse fair brass piece that be all sink in you sea , which they of the hand be in good hope to weigh up again the next summer after . among these ship that be cast away about Tercera , be likewise a flyboat , one of those that have be arrest in Portugal to serve the king , call the white dove , the master of she be one Cornelius Martenson of Schiedam in holland , and there be in her 100 soldier , as in every one of the rest there be . he be overruled by the captain that he can not be master of his own , sail here and there at the mercy of God , as the storm drive he , in the end come within the sight of the hand of Tercera , which the Spaniard perceive think all their safety 84 linschoten’s large testimony a. d 1589-91 . only to consist in put into the road , compel the master and the pilot to make towards the hand , although the master refuse to do it , say , that they be most sure there to be cast away and utter spoil : but the captain call he drunkard and heretic , and strike he with a staff , command he to do as he will have he . the master see this and be compel to do it , say : well then my master , see it be the desire of you all to be cast away , i can but lose one life , [ ii two . 187. ] and therewith desperate he sail towards the shore , and be on that side of the hand , where there be nothing else but hard stone and rock , as high as mountain , most terrible to behold , where some of the inhabitant stand with long rope and cork bind at the end thereof , to throw they down unto the man , that they may lay hold upon they , and save their life : but few of they get so near , most of they be cast away , and smite in piece before they can get to the wall . the ship sail in this manner ( as i say before ) towards the hand , and approach to the shore , the master be a old man , and full of year , call his son that be in the ship with he , and have embrace one another , and take their last farewell , the good old father will his son not to take care for he , but seek to save himself ; for ( say he ) son thou be young , and may have some hope to save thy life , but as for i it be no great matter ( i be old ) what become of i , and therewith each of these shed many tear , as every love father and kind child may well consider , the ship fall upon the cliff , and break in piece , the father on the one side , the son on the other side fall into the sea , each lay hold upon that which come next to hand , but to no purpose ; for the sea be so high and furious , that they be all drown , and only fourteen or fifteen save themselves by swim , with their leg and arm half break and out of joint , among which be the master son , and four other dutch boy : the rest of the Spaniard and sailor , with the captain and master , be drown . who heart will not melt with tear to behold so grievous a sight , special consider with himself that the great cause thereof be the beastliness and insolency of the Spaniard , as in this only example may well be see ? whereby may be consider how the other ship speed , as we our self do in part behold , and by the man that be save do hear more at large , as also some other of our countryman that as then be in the like danger can well witness . on the other hand the loss be no less than in Tercera : for on the hand of saint George there be two ship cast away : on the hand of Pico two ship : on the hand of gratiosa three ship : and beside those there come every where round about diverse piece of break ship , and other thing fleet towards the hand , wherewith the sea be all cover most pitiful to behold . on the hand of S. Michael there be four ship cast away , and between Tercera and S. Michael three moor be sink , which be see and hear to cry out ; whereof not one man be save . the rest put into the sea without mast , all turn and rend : so that of they above 100 whole fleet and armada , be 140 ship in all , there be but 32 or 33 arrive in Spain and Portugal , yea , and shlp^dnuned . those few with so great misery , pain and labour , that not two of they arrive there together , but this day one , and to morrow another , next day the three , and so one after the other to the number aforfesayd . all the rest be cast away upon the hand , and overwhelm in the sea , whereby may be consider what great loss and hindrance they receive at that time : for by many man judgement it be esteem to be much more than be lose by their army that come for England ; and it may well be think , and presume , that it be no other but a just plague purposely send by God upon the Spaniard , and that it may true be say , the take of the revenge be just revenge upon they , and not by the might or force of man , but by the power of God , as some of they open say in the lie of Tercera , that they 86 believe very God will consume they , and that he take part with the lutheran and heretic : say further that so soon as they have throw the dead body of the vice-admiral sir Richard Greenfield overboard , they very think that as he have a devilish faith and religion , and therefore the devil love he , so he present sink into the bottom of the sea , and down into hell , where he raise up all the devil to the revenge of his death : and that they bring so great storm and torment upon the Spaniard , because they only maintain the catholic and romish religion . such and the like blasphemy against God , they cease not open to utter , without be reprove of any man therein , nor for their false opinion : but the most part of they rather say and affirm , that of truth it must needs be so . as one of those indian fleet put out of Nova Spagna , there be 35 of they by storm and tempest cast away and drown in the sea , be 50 in all ; so that but 15 escape . of the fleet that come from Santo Domingo there be 14 cast away , come out of the channel of Havana , whereof the admiral and vice-admiral be two of they : and from terra firma in India there come two ship lade with gold and silver , that be take by the Englishman : and before the spanish army come to Corvo , the Englishman at time have take at the least 20 ship , that come from saint Domingo , India , Brasilia , etc and be all send into England . 87 [ a relation
