our most dear and love brother , greeting . right noble and excellent prince , we have receive your majesty letter bring over by our merchant in their return of their | | last voyage from your port of saint Nicholas ; which letter we have advise read and consider , and thereby perceive that your majesty do great mislike of our late employment of Jerome Horsey into your dominion as our messenger with our highness letter , and also that your majesty do think that we in our letter send by the say messenger have not observe that due order or respect which appertain to your princely majesty , in the form of the same letter , aswell touch the 422 enlargement of your majesty stile and title of honour which your majesty expect to have be therein more particular express , as also in the add of our great seal or signet of arm to the letter which we send to so great a prince as your majesty be : in any of which point we will have be very loath willing to have give just cause of offence thereby to our most dear and love brother . and as touch the say messenger Jerome Horsey we be sorry that contrary to our expectation he be fall into your majesty displeasure , who we mind not to maintain in any his action by which he have so incur your majesty mislike : yet that we have reason at such time as we send he to your majesty to use his service as our messenger , we refer our self to your princely judgement , pray your majesty to reduce into your mind the especial commendation , which in your letter write unto we in the year 1585 , you make of the 1585. say Jerome Horsey his behaviour in your dominion : at which time your majesty be please to use his service as your messenger to we , require our answer of your letter to be return by he and by none other . that employment , with other occasion take by your majesty to use the service of the say Jerome Horsey ( as namely in the year 1587 ) when your majesty send he to we again with your letter , and your liberali and princely privilege at our request grant to our merchant ( for which we have heretofore give thank to your majesty , so do we hereby reiterate our thankfulness for the same ) move we to be of mind , that we can not make choice of any of our subject so fit a messenger to your majesty as he , who your majesty have at several time use upon your own occasion into this our realm . but lest your highness shall continue of the mind that the letter which you send by our ambassador Giles Fletcher ( wherein some mention be make of your conceive displeasure against the say Horsey ) come not to our hand , and that we be keep 423 ignorant of the complaint which your majesty make therein against the say Horsey , we do not deny but that we be acquaint aswell by our ambassador as by those letter of some displeasure conceive against he by your majesty : but your say letter give only a short generail mention of some misdemeanour commit by he , express no particular , we be of opinion that this offence be not so heinous , as that it may utter extinguish all your former princely favour towards he , but that upon his humble submission to your majesty , or upon better examination of the matter of the displeasure conceive against he , the offence may have be either remit , or he thereof may have clear himself . and to that end we be not only by his great importunity long solicit , but by the intercession of some of our nobility give credit to his own defence , we be entreat on his behalf to use his service once again into Russia as our messenger to your majesty , whereby he may have opportunity to deer himself , and either by his answer or by his submission recover your majesty former favour : whereunto our princely nature be move to yield , wish the good of our subject so far forth as his desert may carry he , or his innocence clear he . thus noble prince , our most love and dear brother , it may appear unto your majesty how we be induce to use the service of the say messenger , [ i . 500 ] aswell for the recovery of your majesty favour towards he ( if he have be find worthy of it ) as for experience of the manner and fashion of your country , where he have be much conversant . but sith by your majesty letter it appear that he have not clear himself in your majesty sight , we mean not to use he in any such price hereafter . and as touch your majesty conceit of the brevity which we use in the set down of your majesty stile and title of honour : as nothing be further from 424 we , than to abridge so great and mighty a prince of the honour due unto he ( who we hold for his greatness to deserve more honour than we be able to give he ) so shall we need no further nor sure argument to clear we of the suspicion of the detract from your majesty any part of your just and princely honour and greatness , than the consideration of our own stile , which be thus contract , videlicet , Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of England , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith etc which kingdom and dominion of we be express by these generali word , videlicet , England , France , and Ireland : in every of which there be several principality , dukedom , earldom , province and country : which be several express will enlarge much our stile , and make it of great length ; which by our progenitor have not be use : notwithstanding , we think it no dishonour to we , compendious to abridge the same in all our write and letter write to what prince , king , or potentate soever . whereupon we infer , that hold your majesty generali stile , we offer your highness no dishonour in not express all the particular province : albeit we can willing content our self , upon the knowledge of your usage and custom , to observe that course , which your self
