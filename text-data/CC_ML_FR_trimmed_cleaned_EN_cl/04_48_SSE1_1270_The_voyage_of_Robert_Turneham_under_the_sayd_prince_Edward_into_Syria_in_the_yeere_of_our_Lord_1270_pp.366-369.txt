The travaile of Robert Turneham.{n}[II. i. 39 ]{n}1415-{n}The same in English.{n}RObert Turneham Franciscan, a notable professour of Divinity, was with great dignity Prior of the Coiledge of his Order in the famous Mart towne of Linne, situate upon the river of Isis in Norfolke. Prince Edward surnamed the Long, the sonne of Henry the third, prepared his warlike voyage against the Saracens dwelling in Syria, in the yeere of our Lord, 1268. For the which expedition some earnest preacher was sought to stir up the peoples minds in the cause of religion. And this Turneham seemed to the Prince most worthy to performe that office: so that he being appointed as it were a standerd bearer, went into Syria with the English army, and performed his duety with good commendation. He flourished in the yeere of Christ 1280, setting foorth divers works under the same king Edward the first of that name after the Conquest.{n}
