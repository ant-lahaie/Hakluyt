Maries hospitali of Jerusalem, our entirely beloved friend,{n}greeting and increase of unfained friendship. After divers conferences had in sundry places beyond the seas, betweene the ambassadours and messengers of your late predecessor and of your selfe also, on the one parte, and betweene our especiall ambassadors and messengers on the other parte, concerning reformations, reparations, & restitutions in certaine maner & forme to be performed unto our subjects of both parts, in regard of manifold injuries practised against them both, and after that, in the last conference holden by the ambassadours of us both at the towne of Hage in Holland, there was a motion made concerning a certaine forme of satisfaction, by way of finall conclusion in{n}that behalfe : but not being as then by our ambassadours condescended unto, because they durst not proceede unto the same conclusion without our privitie, relation thereof at length being by them made before us and our counsel: we returned unto your honour an answere in writing by our letters under our privie seale, of our full purpose and intention (unto the which letters we doe at this present referre our selves, as if they were here againe expresly written) what we thought good to have done in this behalfe : so that wee also might by your friendly letters be certaynly informed of your will and expresse consent, being likewise conformable unto your foresayd intention. Nowe whereas since that time we have of late received the certaintie of the matter by your letters written unto us from your castle of Marienburgh, bearing date the 27. of September last past, contayning in effect amongst other matters, that you being mooved with a fervent zeale and speciali affection (as you write) unto the royall crowne of our realme, and having due regard and consideration of our royall majestie, upon the advise of your honourable brethren your counsellers, doe with a thankfull mind accept, and by the tenour of the said letters of yours totally approve the concord of a certaine satisfaction to be performed with the payment of certaine summes of money howsoever due unto your subjects as well of Prussia as of Livonia, expressed in our former letters, within the termes prefixed by our consent and limited in our said letters, and also of other summes which within one whole yeare immediatly following the feast of Easter last past, by sufficient proofes on their part to bee made before our chauncelour at our citie of London, shall be found due unto them : conditionally, that without inconvenience of delay and impediments, the premisses be performed as they ought to be. And that your selfe also will without fayle, upon the termes appoynted for the said payments, procure satisfaction to be made accordingly unto our endamaged subjects{n}with the summes due unto them by reason of their losses, whereof they have sufficient information. Wherefore in regard of those your friendly letters, and your courteous answere returned by them unto us, as is aforesaid, wee doe yeelde unto you right unfained thanks. But because it will undoubtedly be most acceptable and pleasing both unto us and unto our people, and unto you and your subjects, that the zeale and fervencie of love which hath from auncient times growen and increased betweene our progenitours for them and their subjects, and your predecessors and their subjects, and which by the insolencie of certayne lewde persons, without any consent of the principali lords, hath often bene violated betweene us and you and mutually betweene the subjects of us both, may be put in perpetuali ure and obtaine full strength in time to come, sithens hereupon (by Gods assistance) it is to be hoped, that unspeakeable commodity and quiet will redound unto both parts : may it seeme good unto your discretion, as it seemeth expedient unto us, that some messengers of yours sufficiently authorised to parle, agree, and conclude with our deputy, about the mutuall contraction of a perpetuali league and confirmation of friendship, may with all convenient speede be sent unto our presence. At whose arrivall, not onely in this busines so profitable and behoovefull, but also in certaine other affaires concerning the former treaties and conclusions, they may, yea and of necessitie must greatly avayle. Wherefore (our entirely beloved friend) even as upon confidence of the premisses we have thought good to grant unto the marchants and subjects of our realme hill authority to resort unto your dominions, so we doe in like maner graunt unto your marchants and subjects free [licence and liberty with their marchandises and goods securely to come into our realmes and dominions, there to stay, and at their pleasures thence to returne home. Moreover, if Arnold Dassel, who last of all presented your foresayd letters n	97	g{n}A motion for a perpetuali league.{n}unto us, shal thinke good in the meane season to make his abode here in our dominions (as in very deede it is expedient) he may both by serious consideration and deliberate consulting with our comissioners more conveniently and prosperously finde out wayes and meanes, for the more speedy expedition of all the premisses. Fare ye well in Christ.
