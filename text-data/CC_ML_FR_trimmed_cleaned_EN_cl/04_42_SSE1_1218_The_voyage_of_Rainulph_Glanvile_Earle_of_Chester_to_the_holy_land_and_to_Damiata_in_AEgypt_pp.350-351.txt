The travailes of Ranulph Glanvile earle of Chester.{n}The same in English.{n}RAnulph Glanvile earle of Chester, a man of a very noble house, and learned in both the Lawes, deserves of duetie to be here placed by me in the catalogue of woorthy and notable men. He applied so well all the yeeres of his youth to the study of humane and divine Lawes, that he came not so soone to the age of a man, [II. i. 33.] as he had purchased to himselfe by reason of his singular learning, renowme and honour. When the noble men of France went to Ptolomais, upon the counsell of John Brenne king of Jerusalem, they resolved to besiege 35Â°{n}Damiata a city of Egypt, in the yeere 1218. And then Henry the king upon the motion of Honorius the third, bishop of Rome, sent thither this earle Ranulph with a great power of armed souldiers, to further the enterprise of the Christians : whose valure in that warre (by the testimonie of Polidor Virgil) was marveilously commended of all men. After the end of which businesse, he being returned into his countrey, wrote a booke of the lawes of England. It is also reported that he wrote other books, but time the destroyer of many memorials, hath taken them from us. He flourished in the yeere after the nativity of Christ 1230, being very aged, and in the reigne of K. Henry the third.{n}
