The letters of the Queenes most excellent Majestic sent by one Laurence Aldersey unto the Em-perour of Aethiopia, 1597.{n}A.D.{n}130{n}To the most invincible and puissant king of the Abassens, the mightie Emperour of Aethiopia the higher and the lower.{n}ELizabeth by the grace of God Queene of England, France and Ireland, defender of the faith, &c. To the most high and mightie Emperour of Aethiopia greeting. Whereas it is a matter requisite and well beseeming all kings and princes of what lands or nations soever, be they never so much dissevered in place or differing in customes and lawes, to maintaine and preserve the common societie of mankinde, and, as occasion shall be offered, to performe mutuall duties of charitie and benevolence: we for that cause conceiving most undoubted hope of your princely fidelity and courtesie, have given unto this our subject Laurence Aldersey intending to travell into your dominions, these our letters to be delivered without faile unto your Highnesse, to the end they may be a testimony of our good will towards you and of our saide subject his departure from England. Who, after his travels in many forren countreys, being as yet enflamed with a desire more throughly to surveigh and contemplate the world, and now at length to undertake a long and daungerous journey into your territories and regions: both the sayd Laurence thought, and our selves also deemed, that it would very much availe him, as well for his owne safetie as for the attayning of your favour, if, being protected with our broad seale, hee might transport unto your Highnesse a testimony of our loving affection & of his departure from hence. For sithence almightie God the highest creatour and governour of the world hath allotted unto kings and princes his vicegerents over the face of the whole earth, their designed portions and limits to be ruled and administred by them; and by this his gift hath established among them a certaine law of{n}I3I{n}A.D.{n}â€™597-{n}brotherly kindnesse, and an eternall league by them to be observed: it will not (we hope) seeme unpleasant unto your highnesse, when you shall have intelligence of our loving letters sent so huge a distance over sea and land, even from the farthest realme of England unto you in Aethiopia. On the other side our selves shall take great solace and delight, when as by the relation of our owne subjects, the renowme of your name shall be brought unto us from the fountains of Nilus, and from those regions which are situate under the Southerne Tropike. May it please you therefore of your princely clemencie to vouchsafe so much favour on this our subject, that he may, under the safeguard and protection of your name, enter into your highnesse dominions, and there remaine safe and free from danger. Which favour and courtesie wee doe likewise most earnestly request at the hands of other princes, through whose Seigniories our said subject is to passe; and we shall esteeme it as done unto our selfe and for our honours sake.{n}Neither do we require any greater favour in this behalfe, then we are upon the like occasion most ready to graunt unto the subjects of all princes and the people of all Nations, travelling into our dominions.{n}Given at London the fift day of November, in the thirtie and ninth yeere of our reigne: and in the yeare of our Lorde{n}I597-{n}
