O let not then such an indignitie rest on us, as to deprave so notable an enterprise with false rumors, and vaine suppositions, to sleepe in so serious a matter, and renouncing the honour, strength, wealth, and soveraigntie of so famous a conquest, to leave all unto the Spaniard.{n}Townes, and Caciques or Captaines that in this were discovered.{n}Captains.{n}	1	These are enemies to the laos, their money is of white and greene stones.

Here are also many sortes of other good woods.{n}14 These speake the language of the Indians of Dominica. They are but few, but very cruel to their enemies. For they bind, and eat them alive peecemeale. This torment is not comparable to the deadly paine that commeth of hurts, or woundes, made by those arrowes that are invenomed with the juice of ye herbe Wapototo.

One hatchet is the ordinarie price for a Canoa.
