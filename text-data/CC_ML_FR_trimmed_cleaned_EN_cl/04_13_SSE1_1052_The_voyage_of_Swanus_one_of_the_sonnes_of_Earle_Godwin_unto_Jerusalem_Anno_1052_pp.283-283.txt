The voyage of Swanus one of the sonnes of Earle Godwin unto Jerusalem, Anno Dom. 1052, recorded by William of Malmsburie lib. 2. de gestis regum Anglorum, Capite 13.{n}The same in English.	{n}SWanus being of a perverse disposition, and faith-lesse to the king, often times disagreed with his father and his brother Harold : and afterwards prooving a pirate, he stained the vertues of his ancestours with his robberies upon the seas. Last of all, being guilty unto himselfe of the murther of his kinseman Bruno, and (as some do report) of his owne brother, he travailed unto Jerusalem : and in his returne home, being taken by the Saracens, was beaten, and wounded unto death.{n}
