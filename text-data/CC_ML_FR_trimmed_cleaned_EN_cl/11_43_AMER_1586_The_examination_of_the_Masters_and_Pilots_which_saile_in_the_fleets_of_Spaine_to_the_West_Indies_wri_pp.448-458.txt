And then immediately he bringeth five or sixe pilots before examined to give testimonie that he is a good mariner, and sufficient to become a pilot, that he is a Spaniard borne, and that he is not of the race of the Moores, Jewes or Negros.{n}Having made this information, hee presenteth it unto The pilots ad-the Pilot major. And the Pilot major seeing the information to be good, willeth the Kings publique reader Kings reader. of navigation (who is now Roderigo Zamorano) to admit him to his lectures. Whither there doe resort foureteene or fifteene persons that desire to be examined: and they They heare the come to a certaine house which the kings reader hath rea^eri appointed unto him for the same purpose, at eight of the clocke in the morning: and then they stay two houres, for two and two houres likewise in the afternoone: in one of mrneths.{n}453{n}Their disputations of the art of navigation before the Kings reader who is their moderatour.{n}The hall of examination.{n} The maner oj the yong pilots examination.{n}which houres Zamorano readeth unto them, and in the other they aske one another many particulars concerning the art of navigation in the presence of the said kings reader: and him that answereth not to the purpose the sayd reader instructeth more perfectly, and telleth him how everything is. And this exercise continueth two moneths, during which time the examinates must not faile to bee present twise in a day, as is aforesaid.{n}And having heard the kings reader those two moneths, they resort then unto the hall of examination which is in the Contractation house, where there are assembled the Pilot major and divers other pilots, to the number of 25 at the least; who all sitting there in order, the Pilot major demandeth of him that would be examined, of what part of the Indies he desireth to be examined: Whereto the examinate answereth, that he would bee examined concerning Nueva Espanna, or of Nombre de Dios and Tierra Firma. And others that are not experienced in those partes, crave to be examined of Santo Domingo, Puerto rico, and Cuba.{n}Then the Pilot major commandeth the examinate to spread a sea-chart upon the table, and in the presence of the other pilots to depart or shewe the course from the barre of Sant Lucar to the Canarie-Islands, and from thence to the Indies, till he come to that place whereof he is to bee examined, and then also to returne backe to the barre of Sant Lucar in Spaine, from whence he departed. Also the Pilot major asketh him, if when he saileth upon the sea, hee be taken with a contrary wind, what remedie he is to use, that his ship be not too much turmoiled upon the sea ? And the examinate answereth him aswell as he can.{n}Then one of the other pilotes opposeth him about the rules of the Sunne and of the North-starre, and how hee ought to use the declination of the Sunne at all times of the yeere: whom the examinate is bound to answere in every thing that hee demandeth. Then another asketh him of the signes and markes of those 454{n}lands which lye in his way to that haven whereof he is examined. And then another demandeth, that if his mastes should be broken by tempest, what remedy hee would use ? Others aske him, if his ship should take a leake, to the hazarding of the lives of himselfe and his company, what remedy he would find to stop the same with least danger? Others aske him, what remedy, if his rudder should chance to faile ? Others oppose him about the account of the Moone and of the tides? Others aske him if a Pirate should take him and leave him destitute of his Chart, his Astrolabe, and his other instruments serving to take the height of the Sunne and of the starre, what course hee would take in that ex-tremitie? Others demand other questions needfull for a mariner to know, which desireth to be a pilot. Unto all which the examinate is very attentive, and answereth to every particular.{n}After they have all asked him so much as they think expedient, they bid him depart out of the hall, to the ende that every one of them may severally bee sworne upon a booke, that they will speake the trueth. Then they put into a certaine vessell of silver standing there for the same purpose so many beanes, and so many peason as there are pilots within the hall: and every one putting his hand into the vessell in order, he that thinketh the partie examined to be sufficient, taketh up a beane, and he that thinketh him not sufficient, taketh up a pease. And after that all have taken out what they please, the Pilot major looketh what voyces the examinate hath: and if he finde him to have as many voyces for him as against him, he commandeth him to make another voyage: but if he hath more voyces for him then against him, then they give him letters testimoniali of his examination signed by the Pilot major, by the1 kings reader, and the secretary, and sealed with the seale of the Contractation house. And upon the receipt of these letters testimoniali, the new pilot giveth a present unto the Pilot major, and the kings reader, for their gloves and hennes, every one 455{n}The maner of their election.{n}Letters testimoniali of every new pilots examination and approbation, under the hands of the Pilot major, the kings reader, and the secretary, and seale of the Contractation house.{n}The orders of the Contracta-tion house.{n}according to his abilitie, which is ordinarily some two or three ducats.	#{n}And then he may take upon him to be pilot in any ship whatsoever, unto that place for which he was examined : and if he finde in the Indies any ship under the charge of a pilot not before examined, hee may put him out of his office, and may himself take charge of that ship for the same wages that the other pilot agreed for.{n}The pilots wages for making a voyage outward and homeward is according to the burthen of the ship. If she be of 100 tunnes, hee hath 200 or 250 ducats: and if shee bee of 400 or 500 tunnes, he taketh for his wages 500 or 550 ducates: and if she be bigger, he hath a greater allowance: over and besides all which, he hath every day while he remaineth on land, foure reals for his diet. And the greater shippes are alwayes committed unto the more ancient pilots, because they are of greater experience and better skill, then the yonger sort which newly take upon them to be pilots.{n}The pilot undertaketh no farther travell nor care, but in directing the course or navigation: for the masters of the ships take charge of the freighting and preparing their ships, and to pay the mariners, and to doe all things needefull for the ship ; for the pilot commeth not unto the shippe, untill the visitours come to visite the same, to see whether he hath all things necessary for the voyage.{n}The visitours are foure men which are appoynted by the king, and these are men of great understanding: and they come to visite the shippes before they take in their lading, to see whether they be well prepared to make the voyage. And after the ships bee laden, they returne againe to visite them the second time, to see whether they have all things necessary, according to the orders, of the Contractation house: and whether they have all their mariners, victuals, pouder, shot, and ordinance, and all other things necessary for the voyage. And if they want any thing, they charge them upon grievous penalties,, to provide the same before they set out of the haven.{n}The ships that goe to the Indies are wont eche of them to have with them a Notarie, whose charge is to keepe a note of remembrance of all the marchandize which is laden in the ship, and to take the marks thereof, therby to deliver the commodities in the ship to their particular owners, after they have finished their voyage, and he serveth likewise to make willes, and other instruments, which are wont to be made by a Notarie, if any man chanceth to fall sicke. And his wages in eche voyage is as much as the wages of two mariners.{n}The general of the fleetes useth continually, after Thefirstbarke hee is arrived in the Indies, to send into Spaine a barke °f Aviso. of Aviso, to advertise the king of the state of his arrivall;{n}And after the fleetes be ready to come home, he dis-patcheth another pinnesse of Aviso to certifie them how secon^ the fleetes are now ready to set saile, with other particularities. There go with the fleetes two great ships, ' the one as Admirall, the other as Viceadmirall, of the burthen of 400 or 500 tunnes, which carry nothing but victuals and souldiers for the wafting of the rest of the fleete, and these are payd out of the marchandize which come in the fleete, after the rate of one in the hundred, and sometime at one and an halfe in the hundred.{n}There is in the Contractation house of Sivil a table which serveth for an Aranzel, or table of rate or taxation, written in letters of gold, wherein the values of all kind of marchandize, which are embarqued for the Indies, are set downe.{n}^^lY this table a man may know how many Botijas g® or jarres make a tunne of wine, or how many packes, or how many quintals, or how many{n}barrels, or how many chests make a tunne.{n}And all marchandize have their rates set downe, to pay the king his customes and the Master his due fraight.{n}A table of rates, &c. set up in the Contractation house.{n}457{n}And therein is set up in writing that no Master may carry any passenger to the Indies, without licence, especially no learned men, nor any fryer, or clergyman, nor any body else without licence of the king : nor any strangers not borne in the kingdomes of Spaine.{n}Moreover, that they may not carry away any mar-chandize not comprized in the foresaid orders, under paine of death : and that all goods which they carry with them, they ought to carry the same registred; under paine of death.{n}Furthermore, that no Master nor Pilot may carry any Chart, nor Astrolabe, nor Crosse-staffe, nor regiment, without they bee signed and sealed by the Pilot major Alonzo de Chiavez, and the Cosmographer the kings reader Rodrigo Zamorano.{n}Moreover, that going in company with the fleete, they doe and obey all such things, as their general shall command them, under paine of death.{n}Written by me Pedro Dias borne in the Isle of' Palma one of the Canaries, upon the request and gratification of M. Richard Hakluyt, in February 1586.{n}END OF VOLUME XI.{n}
