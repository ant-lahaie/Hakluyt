De Guiana carmen Epicum.{n}Hat worke of honour and eternall name,{n}For all the t’atchieve, Filles me with hands{n}To my hearts{n}world t’envie and us{n}furie, and gives armed{n}peace, that els would{n}gladly turne My limmes and every sense into my thoughts Rapt with the thirsted action of my mind? O Clio, Honors Muse, sing in my voyce, Tell the attempt, and prophecie th’exploit Of his Eliza-consecrated sworde, That in this peacefull charme of Englands sleepe, Opens most tenderly her aged throte, Offring to powre fresh youth through all her vaines, That flesh of brasse and ribs of steele retaines. Riches, and Conquest, and Renowme I sing, Riches with honour, Conquest, without blood, Enough to seat the Monarchic of earth, 446{n}Like to Joves Eagle on Elizas hand. Guiana, whose rich feete are mines of golde, Whose forehead knockes against the roofe of Starres, Stands on her tip-toes at faire England looking, Kissing her hand, bowing her mightie breast, And every signe of all submission making, To be her sister, and the daughter both Of our most sacred Maide: whose barren nesse Is the true fruite of vertue, that may get, Beare and bring forth anew in all perfection, What heretofore savage corruption held In barbarous Chaos; and in this affaire Become her father, mother, and her heire.{n}Then most admired Soveraigne, let your breath Goe foorth upon the waters, and create A golden world in this our yron age, And be the prosperous forewind to a Fleete, That seconding your last, may goe before it In all successe of profite and renowme: Doubt not but your election was divine, (Aswell by Fate as your high judgement ordred) To raise him with choise Bounties, that could adde Height to his height; and like a liberali vine, Not onely beare his vertuous fruite aloft, Free from the Presse of squint-eyd Envies feete, But decke his gracious Proppe with golden bunches, And shroude it with broad leaves of Rule oregrowne From all blacke tempests of invasion.{n}Those Conquests that like general earthquakes shooke The solid world, and made it fall before them, Built all their brave attempts on weaker grounds, And lesse perswasive likelihoods then this;{n}Nor was there ever princely Fount so long Powr’d forth a sea of Rule with so free course, And such ascending Majestie as you: Then be not like a rough and violent wind, 447{n}That in the morning rends the Forrests downe, Shoves up the seas to heaven, makes earth to tremble, And toombes his wastfull bravery in the Even: But as a river from a mountaine running, The further he extends the greater growes, And by his thriftie race strengthens his streame, Even to joyne battell with th’imperious sea Disdayning his repulse, and in despight Of his proud furie, mixeth with his maine, Taking on him his titles and commandes: So let thy soveraigne Empire be encreast, And with Iberian Neptune part the stake, Whose Trident he the triple world would make.{n}You then that would be wise in Wisdomes spight, Directing with discredite of direction, And hunt for honour, hunting him to death. With whom before you will inherite gold,  You will loose golde, for which you loose your soules;{n}You that chuse nought for right, but certaintie, And feare that valour will get onely blowes, Placing you faith in Incredulitie.{n}Sit till you see a wonder, Vertue rich: Till Honour having golde, rob golde of honour, Till as men hate desert that getteth nought, They loath all getting that deserves not ought; And use you gold-made men as dregges of men; And till your poysoned soules, like Spiders lurking In sluttish chin ekes, in mystes of Cobwebs hide Your foggie bodies and your dunghill pride.{n}O Incredulitie, the wit of Fooles, That slovenly will spit on all things faire, The CoWards castle, and the Sluggards cradle How easie t’is to be an Infidel ?{n}But you Patrician Spirites that refine Your flesh to fire, and issue like a flame{n}448{n}On brave indevours, knowing that in them The tract of heaven in morne-like glory opens, That know you cannot be the Kings of earth, (Claiming the Rights of your creation) And let the Mynes of earth be Kings of you; That are so farre from doubting likely drifts, That in things hardest y’are most confident: You that know death lives, where power lives unusde, Joying to shine in waves that burie you, And so make way for life even through your graves; That will not be content like horse to hold A thread-bare beaten way to home affaires: But where the sea in envie of your reigne, Closeth her wombe, as fast as t’is disclosde, That she like Avarice might swallow all, And let none find right passage through her rage: There your wise soules as swift as Eurus lead Your Bodies through, to profit and renowne, And skorne to let your bodies choke your soules, In the rude breath and prisoned life of beastes: You that herein renounce the course of earth, And lift your eyes for guidance to the starres, That live not for yourselves, but to possesse Your honour’d countrey of a generail store;{n}In pitie of the spoyle rude selfe-love makes, Of them whose lives and yours one ayre doth feede, One soile doeth nourish, and one strength combine; You that are blest with sence of all things noble, In this attempt your compleat woorthes redouble.{n}But how is Nature at her heart corrupted, (I meane even in her most ennobled birth) How in excesse of Sence is Sence bereft her! That her most lightening-like effects of lust Wound through her flesh, her soule, her flesh unwounded ;{n}And she must neede incitements to her good, Even from that part she hurtes! O how most like x	449	2f{n}Art thou (heroike Autor of this Act) To this wrong’d soule of Natute that sustainst Paine, charge, and perill for thy countreys good, And she much like a bodie numb’d with surfeits, Feeles not thy gentle applications For the health, use, and honour of her powers! Yet shall my verse through all her ease-lockt eares Trumpet the Noblesse of thy high intent: And if it cannot into act proceed, The fault and bitter penance of the fault Make red some others eyes with penitence, For thine are cleare; and what more nimble spirits, Apter to byte at such unhooked baytes Gaine by our losse; that must we needs confesse Thy princely valure would have purchast us. Which shall be fame eternall to thy name, Though thy contentment in thy grave desires, Of our advancement, faile deserv’d effect.{n}O how I feare thy glory which I love, Least it should dearely grow by our decrease. Natures that sticke in golden-graveld springs, In mucke-pits cannot scape their swallowings.{n}But we shall foorth I know; Golde is our Fate, Which all our actes doth fashion and create.{n}Then in the Thespiads bright Propheticke Fount, Me thinkes I see our Liege rise from her throne, Her eares and thoughts in steepe amaze erected, At the most rare endevour of her power. And now she blesseth with her woonted Graces Th’industrious Knight, the soule of this exploit, Dismissing him to convoy of his starres.{n}And now for love and honour of his woorth, Our twise-borne Nobles bring him Bridegroome-like, That is espousde for vertue to his love With feasts and musicke, ravishing the aire, To his Argolian Fleet, where round about{n}4So{n}His bating Colours English valure swarmes In haste, as if Guianian Orenoque With his Fell waters fell upon our shore. And now a wind as forward as their spirits, Sets their glad feet on smooth Guianas breast, Where (as if ech man were an Orpheus) A world of Savages fall tame before them, Storing their theft-free treasuries with golde, And there doth plentie crowne their wealthie fields, There Learning eates no more his thriftlesse bookes, Nor Valure Estridge-like his yron armes. There Beautie is no strumpet for her wants, Nor Gallique humours putrifie her blood: But all our Youth take Hymens lights in hand, And fill eche roofe with honor’d progenie. There makes Societie Adamantine chaines, And joyns their hearts with wealth, whom wealth disjoin’d.{n}There healthfull Recreations strow their meades, And make their mansions daunce with neighbourhood, That here were drown’d in churlish Avarice.{n}And there do Pallaces and temples rise	{n}Out of the earth, and kisse th’enamored skies, Where new Britannia humblie kneeles to heaven, The world to her, and, both at her blest feet, In whom the circles of all Empire meete.{n}G.
