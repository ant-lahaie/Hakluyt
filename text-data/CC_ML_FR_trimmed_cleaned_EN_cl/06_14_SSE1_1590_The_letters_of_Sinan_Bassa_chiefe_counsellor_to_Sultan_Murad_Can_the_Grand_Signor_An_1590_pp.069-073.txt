The letters of Sinan Bassa chiefe counsellour to Sultan Murad Can the Grand Signior, to the sacred Majestie of Elizabeth Queene of England, shewing that upon her request, and for her sake especially, hee graunted peace unto the King and kingdome of Poland.{n}The same in English.	[ii. i. 295.J{n}MOst glorious, and the most resplendent of women, most select Princesse, most gratious Elizabeth Queene of the valiant followers of Jesus in the famous kingdom of England, most wise governesse of all the affaires and businesses of the people and family of the Nazarens, most sweet fountaine of brightnesse and glory, most acceptable cloud of raine, inheritresse & Ladie of the blessednesse and glory of the renowmed kingdome of England, to whom in humble wise all men offer their petitions: wishing of the almightie Creator most happie increase and prosperous successe unto all your Majesties affaires and actions, and offering up mutuall & perpetuali vowes worthy of our familiarity, with eternall prayses: In most friendly manner we signifie unto your princely Highnesse, that certaine yeeres past the most mightie Cesarlike majestie of the Grand Signor waged unspeakeable warres with Casul-bas the Prince of the Persians, in regarde of which warres he would not goe in battell against any other places; and for that cause{n}certaine theeves in the partes of Polonia called Cosacks, and other notorious persons living in the same partes ceased not to trouble and molest the subjects of our most mightie Emperour. But now having finished and brought to some good issue his affaires in Persia, determining to punish the saide malefactors of Poland, and for that purpose committing an army unto the Beglerbeg of Grecia, and the yeere last past, sending his imperiali commaundement unto the Prince of the Tartars, he hath forraged, molested, and layed waste some part of the kingdome of Poland, and the Cosacks and other notorious offenders have received condigne punishment. Which the king of Poland perceiving sent two Embassadours to his imperiali Highnesse signifying, that he would hunt out the said malefactors, and inflict most severe punishments upon them, and also that he would better his gift, which he hath for many yeeres heretofore ordinarily sent unto the porch of his imperiali Highnesse. Howbeit his imperiali majestie (upon whom the almightie creator hath bestowed so great power, and who vouchsafeth to give eare unto all humble suppliants) rejecting the supplication of the King of Poland, determined againe to send his armie against the said king, and by the helpe of the Almightie creator, utterly to subvert and overthrowe his kingdome. By your Majesties Embassadour resident in the blessed and glorious porch of his imperiali Highnesse interposing himselfe as a mediatour, signifying that from the partes of Poland you were furnished with corne, gun-powder, mastes of ships, guns, and other necessaries, and craving peace on the behalfe of the kingdome and king of Poland, and making intercession, that the said king might not be molested nor troubled by the meanes of the Grand Signor, & declaring that this was your Majesties most earnest desire; so soone as the report and intercession of your Majesties Embassadour was signified unto the Grand Signor, for your sake, unto whom all honour and favourable regard is due, upon the condition aforesaid, namely, that the wicked Cosacks{n}might be sought out and grievously punished, or that their offences might be remitted for the value of some small gift, upon this condition (I say) the letters of his imperiali Highnesse were sent unto the king of Poland. Howbeit had not this conclusion of league and amitie beene sollicited on the behalfe of your Majestie, his imperiali Highnesse would never have vouchsafed the same unto the kingdome of Poland. But for your Majesties sake his imperiali Highnesse hath exhibited this so singular a favour unto the said king and kingdome of Poland. And hereof your Majestie and the king of Poland ought certainely to be perswaded. We wish your Majestie most happily and well to fare. Given at Constantinople in the ende of the moneth called Sabaum, in the yeare of our sacred prophet Mahomet 998, and in the yeere of Jesus 1590, the 12 of June.{n}
