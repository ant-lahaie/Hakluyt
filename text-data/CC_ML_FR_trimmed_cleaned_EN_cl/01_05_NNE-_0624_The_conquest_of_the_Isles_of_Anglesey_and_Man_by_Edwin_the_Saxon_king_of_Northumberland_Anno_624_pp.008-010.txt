Under which king, after he had once accepted of the Christian faith, the power both of the heavenly & of his earthly kingdome was inlarged ; insomuch, that he (which no English king had done before him) brought under his subjection all the provinces of Britaine, which were inhabited either by the English men themselves, or by the Britons. Moreover, he subdued unto the crowne of England (as we have above signified) the Hebrides, commonly called the Westerne Islands.
