market place wherein all thing be to be sell through every street continual be cry all thing [ ii two . 80 . ] necessary , as flesh of all sort , freshfish , herb , oil , vinegar , meal , rise : in summa , all thing so plentiful , that many house need no servant , every thing be bring to their door . Most part of the merchant remain in the suburb , for that the city be shut up every night , as i have say . the merchant therefore , the better to attend their business , do choose rather to make their abode without in the suburb then within 326 the city . i have see in this river a pretty kind of fish , not to be omit in my opinion , and therefore i will set it down . the king have in many river Odmcus good store of barge full of sea - crowe that breed , be the feed and do die therein , in certain cage , allow ' monthly a certain provision of rise . Theise barge the king bestow upon his great magistrate , give to some two , to some three of they as he think good , to fish therewithal ! after this manner . at the hour appoint to fish , all the barge be bring together in a circle , where the river be shallow , and the crow tie together under the wing be let leap down into the water , some under , some above , worth the look upon : each one as he have fill his bag , go to his own barge and empti it , which do , he return to fish again . thus have take good store of fish , they set the crow at liberty , and do suffer they to fish for their own pleasure . there be in that city where i be , twenty barge at the least of these aforesaid crow . i go almost every day to see they , yet can i never be thorough satisfy to see so strange a kind of fish .
