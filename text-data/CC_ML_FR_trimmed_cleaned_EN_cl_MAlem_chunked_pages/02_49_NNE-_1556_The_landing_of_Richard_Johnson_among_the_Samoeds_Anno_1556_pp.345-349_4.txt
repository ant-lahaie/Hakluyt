of the line stiff and together , and then i hear a thing fall into the kettle of water which be before he in the tent . thereupon i ask they that sit by i what it be that fall into the 348 water that stand before he . and they answer i , that it be his head , his shoulder and left arm , which the line have cut off , i mean the knot which i see [ i . 285 . i afterward draw hard together . than i rise up and will have look whether it be so or not , but they lay hold on i , and say , that if they shall see he with their bodily eye , they shall live no long . and the most part of they can speak the ruff tongue to be understand : and they take i to be a russian . than they begin to hallow with these word , oghaoo , oghaoo , oghaoo , many time together . and as they be thus sing and out call , i see a thing like a finger of a man two time together thrust through the gown from the priest . i ask they that sit next to i what it be that i see , and they say , not his finger ; for he be yet dead : and that which i see appear through the gown be a beast , but what beast they know not nor will not tell . and i look upon the gown , and there be no hole to be see : and then at the last the priest lift up his head with his shoulder and arm , and all his body , and come forth to the fire . thus far of their service which i see during the space of certain hour : but how they do worship their idol that i see not : for they put up their stuff for to remove from that place where they lie . and i go to he that serve the priest , and ask he what their god say to he when he lie as dead . he answer , that his own people do not know : neither be it for they to know : for they must do as he command . this i see the lift day of Januarie in the year of our lord 1556 . after the english account .
