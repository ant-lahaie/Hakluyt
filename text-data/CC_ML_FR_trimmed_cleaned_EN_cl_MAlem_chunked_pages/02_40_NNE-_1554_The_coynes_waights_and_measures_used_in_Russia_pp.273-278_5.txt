will be save . and yet notwithstanding our merchant may be there in the winter to serve the emperor and his court . The the emperor emperor be a great merchant himself of wax and l sable , which with good foresight may be procure to mseife n their hand : as for other commodity there be little or none in Moscovia , beside those above rehearse : if there be other , it be bring thither by the Turk , who will be dainty to buy our clothes consider the charge of carriage over land . our merchant may do well to provide for the russes such ware as the dutch nation do serve they of , as Flanders and Holland clothes , which i believe , they shall 277 serve better and with less charge than they of rye or dorpt , or revel : for it be no small adventure to bring their clothes out of Flanders to either of these place , and their charge not little to carry they over land to novogrode , which be from rye nine hundred russian mile . this novogrode be a place well furnish with flax , wax , hide , tallow and many other thing : the best flax in Russia be bring thither and there sell by the hundred bundle , which be do also at Vologda , and they that bring the flax to novogrode , dwell as near Vologda , as novogrode , and when they hear of the utterance which they may have with our nation , they will as willing come to they as go to other . two sort of they have in Russia two sort of flax , the one be axe - call great flax , and the other small : that which they call great flax be better by four rubble in 100 bundle then the small : it be much long than the other , and clean without wood : and whereas of the small flax there go 27 . or 28 bundle to a shippound , there go not of the great sort above 22 . or 24 at the most . there be many other trifle in Russia , as soap , mat , etc but i think there will be no great account make of they .
