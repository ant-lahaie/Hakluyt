the chief man of the island , who agree with my lord that he shall have of they sixty buttes of wine , and fresh victual to refresh himself and his company withal : but as for fresh water , they can not satisfy our need therein , have themselves little or none , save such as they save in vessel or cistern when it rain , and that they have rather give we two ton of wine then one of water : but they request that our soldier may not come on shore , for they themselves will bring all they have promise to the waterside , which request be grant , we keep one of they aboard with we until their promise be perform , and the other we send to shore with our empty cask , and some of our man to help to fill , and bring they away with such other provision as be promise : so the Margaret , captain Davis his ship , and another of Weymouth stay ride at anchor before the town , to take in our provision . this ship of Weymouth come to we the day before , and have take a rich prize ( as it be report ) worth sixteen thousand pound , which bring we news that the west - indian fleet be not yet come , but will come very short . but we with the victory put off to sea , and upon Saturday the four of October , we take a french ship of saint Malo ( a city of the unholy league ) load with fish from Newfoundland : which have be in so great a tempest , that she be constrain to cut her main mast overboard for her safety , and be now come to Graciosa , to repair her self . but so hardly it befall she , that she do not only not repair her former loss , but lose all that remain unto we . the chief of her man we take into our ship , and send some of our man , mariner , and soldier into she to bring she into England . upon
