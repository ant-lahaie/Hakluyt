the book of sir John Gresham , and his brethren , and you shall find what i have say to be true . also you know , that we be force to seek oil out of Spain , and that for these many year they have be sell for 25 pound and 30 pound the ton : whereas , if we can obtain the foresay safeconduct from the Turk , there be diverse place in his dominion , where we may lade 500 ton , at 5 pound sterling the ton . the place be Modon , and Coron , which be but twelve mile distant the one from the other , and do stand in our way to Chio , as you may plain see by the card also these be place where we may utter our own commodity , and not only these two place , 114 but many other , where we may have oil , and be better use than we be in Spain , where we pay very dear , and also be very evil entreat many way , as to you be not unknown . so that by these mean ( if the merchant will ) we may be ease , and have such a trade as the like be not in Christendom . now , as for get they safeconduct , if i be but able to spend one hundred pound by the year , i will be bind to lose it , if that i do not obtain the foresay safeconduct . for i know that if the inhabitant of Chio do but think that we will trade thither again , they at their own cost will procure to we a safeconduct , without any penny of charge to the merchant . so that if the merchant will but bear my charge to solicit the cause , i will undertake it my self . wherefore i pray you speak to m . winter and the other merchant , that this matter may take effect . and let i have your answer herein assoon as convenient you may , for that the time of the year draw nigh that this business must be do . thus i commit you to God , and rest always you to command . you as your servant Gaspar Campion .
