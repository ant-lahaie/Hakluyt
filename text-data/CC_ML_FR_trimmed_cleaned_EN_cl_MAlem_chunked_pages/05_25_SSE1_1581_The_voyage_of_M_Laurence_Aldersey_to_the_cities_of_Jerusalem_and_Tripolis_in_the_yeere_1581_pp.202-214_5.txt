the three and twenty of the same month , we come in the sight of Candia which day the wind come contrary , with great blast , and storm , until the eight and twenty of the same month : in which time , the mariner cry out upon i , because i be a english man , and say , i be no good christian , and wish that i be in the midst of the sea , say , that they , and the ship , be the worse for i . i answer , true it may well be , for i think my self the 206 worst creature in the world , and consider you your self also , as i do my self , and then use your discretion . the friar preach , and the sermon be do , i be demand whether i do understand he : i answer , yea , and tell the friar himself , thus you say in your sermon , that we be not all good Christians , or else it be not possible for we to have such weather : to which i answer , be you well assure , that we be not indeed all good Christians , for there be in the [ ii i . 152 . ] ship some that hold very unchristian opinion : so for that time i satisfy he , although ( they say ) that i will not see , when they say the procession , and honour their image , and pray to our lady , and saint mark . there be also a gentleman , a italian , which be a passenger in the ship , and he tell i what they say of i , because i will not sing , salve Regina , and have Maria , as they do : i tell they , that they that pray to so many , or seek help of any other , then of God the father , or of Jesus Christ his only son , go a wrong way to work , and rob God of his honour , and wrought their own destruction
