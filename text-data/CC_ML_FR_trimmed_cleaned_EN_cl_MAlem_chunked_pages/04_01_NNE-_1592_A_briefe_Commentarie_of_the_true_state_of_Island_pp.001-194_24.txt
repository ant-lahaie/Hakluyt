any whit more ground upon experience , and for that cause to be reject . but that i may not seem somewhat foolhardy , for accuse this royal look glass of falsehood ( not to mention any of those thing which it report as less credible ) lo here a few thing ( friendly reader ) which i suppose deserve no credit at all . 1 of a certain isle in Ireland , have a church and a parish in it , the inhabitant whereof decease be not bury in the earth , but like live man , do continual , against some bank or wall in the churchyard , stand bolt - upright : neither be they subject to any corruption or downfall : insomuch that any of the posterity may there seek for , and behold their ancestor . 2 of another isle of Ireland , where man be not mortali . iio 3 of all the earth and tree of Ireland , be of force to resist all poison , and to kill serpent , and other venomous thing , in any country whatsoever , by the only virtue and presence thereof , yea even without touch . 4 of a three isle of Ireland , that the one half thereof become a habitation of devil , but that the say devil have no jurisdiction over the other half , by reason of a church there build , although , as the whole isle be without inhabitant , so this part be continual destitute of a pastor , and of divine service : and that it be so by nature . 5 of a four isle of Ireland float up and down in a huge lake , the grass whereof be a most present remedy for all kind of disease , and that the hand , at certain season , especial on Sunday , come to the bank of the lake , so that any man may then easy enter into it , as it be into a ship : which notwithstanding ( say he ) destiny will not suffer any more than one to enter at a time .
