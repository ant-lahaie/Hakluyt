, save that here be omit the miracle of harden body , be by he attribute to one of the say fountain . but they can at one time break forth , both out of the mountain it self , and near unto the mountain . but here i will willing demand , by what reason any of the peripatetic can affirm , that there be some thing in nature cold than the element of water , or hot than the element of fire . from whence ( i pray 128 you , learned writer ) proceed this coldness ? from whence come this heat ? have we not learn out of your school that water be a element most cold and somewhat moist : and in such sort most cold , that for the make of secondary quality , it must of necessity be remit , and be simple , that it can be apply to the use of mankind ? i do here deliver these oracle of the natural philosopher , not know whether they be true or false . m .
