take a cymbali or bell , and ring therewith , as they use to ring to dinner or bevoir in cloister , at the sound whereof many creature of diverse kind come down from the mount , some like ape , some like cat , some like monkey ; and some have face like man . and while i stand behold of they , they gather themselves together about he , to the number of 4200 . of those creature , put themselves in good order , before who he set a platter , and give they the say fragment to eat . and when they have eat he ring upon his cymbal the second time , and they all return unto their former place . then , wonder great at the matter , i demand what kind of creature those may be ? they be ( quoth he ) the soul of noble man which we do here feed , for the love of God who govern the world : and as a man be honourable or noble in this life , so his soul after death , enter into the body of some excellent beast or other , but the soul of simple and rustical people do possess the body of more vile and brutish creature . than i begin to refute that foul error : howbeit my speech do nothing at all prevail with he : for he can not be persuade that any soul may remain without a body . from thence i depart unto a certain city name Chilenso , the wall whereof contain 40 . mile in cir - Chilenso . cuit . in this city there be 360 . bridge of stone , the fair that ever i see : and it be well inhabit , have a great navy belong thereunto , and abound with all kind of victual and other commodity . and thence i go unto a certain river call Thalay , which , where it Thalay . be most narrow , be 7 . mile broad : and it run through the midst of the land of Pygmaei , who chief city be 427 Cakam .
