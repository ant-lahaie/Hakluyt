Cadiz , and go no far , and why port S . Mary be so fair a town , and so near to they , be forbear ? and why shears ali & s xeres ? and why Rotta and the like ? and why this or that be do ? and why that or this leave undo ? i will not answer he with our common english proverb , as i may , which be : that one fool may ask more question in one hour , than ten discrete man can well answer in five day . 266 but that grave ancient writer , Cornelius Tacitus , have a wise , brief , pithy say , and it be this : Nemo tentavit inquirere in columnas Herculis , sanctifisque ac reverentius habitum est de factis deorum credere , quim scire . which say , in my fancy , fit marvellous well for this purpose : and so much the rather , for that this Cadiz be that very place , ( at least by the common opinion ) where those say pillar of Hercules be think to be place : and , as some say , remain as yet not far off to be see . but to let that pass , the say bear this discrete meaning in it , albeit in a pretty kind of mystical manner utter : that it befitteth not inferior person to be curious , or too inquisitive after prince action , neither yet to be so saucy and so malapert , as to seek to dive into their secret , but rather always to have a right reverend conceit and opinion of they , and their do : and thereon so rest our inward thought , to seek to go no further , but so to remain ready always to arm our self with dutiful mind , and willing obedience , to perform and put in execution that which in their deep insight and heroical designment , they shall for our good , and the care of the common wealth determine upon . this , and much less to , may suffice to satisfy any honest mind man .
