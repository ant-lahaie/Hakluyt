in England . they will neither worship nor honour any image that be make forth of their own country . for their own image ( say they ) have picture to declare what they be , and how they be of God , and so be not we : they say , look how the painter or carver have make they , so we do worship they , and they worship none before they be christen . they say we be but half Christians : because we observe not part of the old law with the turk . therefore they call themselves more holy than we . they have none other learning but their mother tongue , nor will suffer no other in their country among they . all their service in church be in their mother tongue . they have the old and new testament , which be daily read among they : and yet their superstition be no less . for when the priest do read , they have such trick in their read , that no man can understand they , nor no man give ear to they . for all the while the priest read , the people sit down and one talk with another . but when the priest be at service no man sit , but gagle and duck like so many goose . and as for their prayer they have but little skill , but use to say as body pomele : as much to say , lord have mercy upon i . for the ten man within the land can say the pater noster . and as for the creed , no man may be so bold as to meddle therewith but in the church : for they say it shall not be speak of , but in the church . Speake to they of the commandment , and they will say they be give to Moses in the law , which Christ have now 236 abrogate by his precious death and passion : therefore , ( say they ) we observe little or none thereof . and i do believe they . for
