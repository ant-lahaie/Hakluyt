lade it for our account , and to come at our adventure , and he to be pay at the return of the ship in velvet , satin , or any other kind of silk , or cloth of gold , cloth of tissue , or accord as his commission shall be that he shall send we in the ship , and accord to such pattern as he shall send . we do not find the ambassador now at the last so conformable to reason as we have think we shall . he be very mistrustful , and think every man will beguile he . therefore you have need to take heed how you have to do with he or with any such , and to make your bargain plain , and to set they down in writing . for they be subtle people , and do not always speak the truth , and think other man to be like themselves . therefore we will have none of they to send any good in our ship at any time , nor none to come for passenger , unless the emperor do make a bargain with you , as be aforesaid , for his own person . also we charge you not to suffer any of our nation to send any ware to their wife or friend in any of our ship ; but to take their money there to be pay here by the company and not otherwise : and to have consideration how you do take the roble . for although we do rate it after sixteen shilling eight penny of our money , yet it be not worth past 12 . or 13 . shilling sterling . Moreover , you have need to send new account , for they that come in the 391 Edward be mar and tear , so that we can make no reckon by they : and likewise to write we a perfect note of all the good which you receive the last voyage out of the Edward , and herein not to fail .
