gift and friendship . our savage make sign in answer from they that our man shall be deliver we , and be yet live , and make sign likewise unto we that we shall write our letter unto they , for they know very well the use we have of writing , and receive knowledge thereof , either of our poor captive countryman which they betray , or else by this our new captive who have see we daily write , and repeat again such word of his language as we desire to learn : but they for this night , because it be late , depart without any letter , although they call earnest in haste for the same . and the next morning early be the seven of August , they call again for the letter , which be deliver unto they , they speedy depart , make sign with three finger , and point to the sun , that they mean to return within 3 day , until which time we hear no more of they , and about the time appoint they return , in such sort as you shall afterward hear . this night because the people be very near unto we , the lieutenant cause the trumpet to sound a call , and every man in the island repair to the ensign , he put they in mind of the place so far from their 308 country wherein they live , and the danger of a great multitude which they be subject unto , if good watch and ward be not keep , for at every low water the enemy may come almost dryfoot from the main unto we , wherefore he will every man to prepare he in good readiness upon all sudden occasion , and so give the watch their charge , the company depart to rest . i think the captain letter well worth the remembering , not for the circumstance of curious endite , but for the substance and good meaning therein contain , and therefore have repeat here the same , as by himself it be hasty write .
