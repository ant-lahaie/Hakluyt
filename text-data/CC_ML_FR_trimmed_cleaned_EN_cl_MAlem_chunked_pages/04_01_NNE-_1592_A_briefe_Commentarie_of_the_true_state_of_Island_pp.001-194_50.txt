because the earth be hot change and give savour unto the water . now concern the colour of water so say Cardane . there be the same reason ( say he ) of the colour of water , that there be of the savour thereof , for both have their originali from the earth . for there be white water within two mile of Glauca a town in Misena : red water in Radera a river of Misena not far from Radeburg . : and in old time near unto Joppa in Judea : green water in the mountain of Carpathus by Neusola : sky - coloured or blue water between the mountain of Feltrius and Tarvisius : and it be report that there be water of that colour in Thermopylis : coalblack water in Alera a river of Saxony , at that place where it dischargeth it self into the Weser . the cause of these colour be the colour of the soil . also Aristotle say , that about the promontory of Japigia , there be a fountain which stream blood : add moreover , that mariner be drive far from that place of the sea , by reason of the extreme stench thereof . Furthermore , they say that in Idumaea there be a fountain which change colour four time in a year : for sometime it be green , sometime white , sometime bloody , and sometime muddy colour . concern the smell of water , thus write Cardane . there be the like reason of difference in smell . but for the most part the steam of water be unpleasant , because the earth do seidome time smell well . the water of the river Anigris in Aelis stink , to the destruction , not only of fish , but also of man . about Meton in Messania , out of a certain pond there have be draw most sweet smell , and odoriferous water . j34 i do recite all these example to the end that no man shall make a great wonder at the colour , smell , and savour of water that be in island
