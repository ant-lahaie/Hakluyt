their protection . and if it be right and equity to show such humanity towards all man , doubtless the same ought chief to be show to merchant , who wander about the world , search both the land and the sea , to carry such good and profitable thing , as be find in their country , to remote region and kingdom , and again to bring from the same , such thing as they find there commodious for their own country : both aswell that the people , to who they go , may not be destitute of such commodity as their country bring not forth to they , as that also they may be partaker of such thing , whereof they abound . for the god of heaven and earth great provide for mankind , will not that all thing shall be find in one region , to the end that one shall have need of another , that by this mean friendship may be establish among all man , and every one seek to gratify all . for the establish and furtherance of which universali amity , certain man of our realm , move hereunto by the say desire , have institute and take upon they a voyage by sea into far country , to the intent that between our people and they , a way may be open to bring in , and carry out merchandise , desire we to further their enterprise . who assent to their petition , have license the right valiant and worthy sir Hugh Willoughby , knight , and other our trusty and faithful servant , which be with he , accord to their desire , to go to country to they heretofore unknown , aswell to seek such thing as we lack , as also to carry unto they from our region , such thing as they lack . so that hereby not only commodity may ensue both to they and we , but also a indissoluble and perpetuali league of friendship be establish between we both , while they permit we to take of their thing , such whereof they have abundance in their region , and we again grant they such thing of we , whereof they be destitute .
