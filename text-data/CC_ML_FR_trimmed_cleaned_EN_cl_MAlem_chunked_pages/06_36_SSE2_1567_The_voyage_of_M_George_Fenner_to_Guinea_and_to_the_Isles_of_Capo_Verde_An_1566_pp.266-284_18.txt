our gunner to make all our ordinance ready with crossebarre , chaineshotte and hailshot : so the ship and caravel come up , and as soon as they be right in our side , they shoot at we as much ordinance as they can , think to have lay we present aboard : whereupon we give they such a heat with both our side , that they be both glad to fall astern of we , and so pause the space of two or three hour be a very small gale of wind . then come up the other five and shoot all at we , and so fall all astern of we , and then go to counsel together . then our small bark name the George come to we , and we confer together a great space . and as the Portugal ship and caravel be come to we again , our bark mind to fall astern of we and so to come up again , fall quick upon the lee , and by reason of the little wind , it be so long before she can fill her sail again , that both the ship and caravel be come up to we , and she fall in among they make reasonable shift with they , but they get a head of she , so that she can not fetch we : then 5 of the caravel follow she , but we see she defend her self against they all . then come the great ship and the caravel to we , and fight with we all that day with their ordinance . the may - floure our other consort be very good by the wind , take the benefit thereof and halde all that day close by the wind , but can not come near we . so when night again be come , they give over their fight and follow we all the night . 282 in these many fight it can not otherwise be but needs some of our man must be slay , ( as they be indeed ) and diverse hurt , and our tackle much spoil : yet for all this we do our best endeavour
