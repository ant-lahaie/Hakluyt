and out of their Lents , they observe true the wednesdaye and Friday throughout the year : and on the Saturday they do eat flesh . 237 furthermore they have a great number of religious man : which be black monk , and they eat no flesh throughout the year , but fish , milk and butter . by their order they shall eat no fresh - fish , and in their Lents they eat nothing but colewort , cabbage , salt cucumber , with other root , as radish and such like . their drink be like our penny ale , and be call quass . they have service daily in their church ; and use to go to service two hour before day , and that be end by day light . at nine of the clock they go to mass : that end , to dinner : and after that to service again : and then to supper . you shall understand that at every dinner and supper they have declare the exposition of the gospel that day : but how they wrest and twine the scripture and that together by report it be wonderful . as for whoredom and drunkenness there be none such living : and for extortion , they be the most abominable under the sun . now judge of their holiness . they have twice as much land as the duke himself have : but yet he be reasonable even with they , as thus : when they take bribe of any of the poor and simple , he have it by a order . when the abbot of any of their house die , than the duke have all his good movable and moveable : so that the successor buy all at the duke hand : and by this mean they be the best fermer the duke have . thus with their religion i make a end , trust hereafter to know it better . to the right worshipful and my singular good uncle , master Christopher Frothingham , give these . sir , read and correct ; for great be the defect .
