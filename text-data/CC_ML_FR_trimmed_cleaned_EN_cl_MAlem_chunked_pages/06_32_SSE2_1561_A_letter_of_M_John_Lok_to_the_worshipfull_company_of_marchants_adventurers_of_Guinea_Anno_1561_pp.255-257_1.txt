little experience 255 i have have , lead i to think that the ship who water work and footing be spend and rot can be but leak for man . next , the unseasonable time of the year which be now present . and how only by mean of the unseasonable time in the return from the voyage home , many thereby have decay , to the great misery and calamity of the rest , and also to the great slander of the voyage ( which i much respect ) the last and other voyage have declare . and what it be to make the voyage in unseasonable time , that have the second voyage also declare . wherefore weigh and foresee this ( as i may well term it ) calamity and unevitable danger of man , and that by man she must be bring home again ( except that god will show a extraordinary miracle ) i purpose not nor dare i venture with a safe conscience to tempt God herein . again , forsomuch as she be alone , and have so little help of boat or pinnace in her trade , and also for she water , where a long time of force must be spend , my go , to the accomplishment of your expectation , will be to small effect for this time , because i shall want both vessel and man to accomplish it . and i will not glad so spend my time and travel , to my great charge and pain , and after , for not fall out accord , to lose both pot and water , as the proverb be . as for the primrose , if she be there , her trade will be end or ever we come there , so that she of force , by want of provision , must return : yea , though we shall carry with we a supply for she , yet be the meeting of her doubtful , and though we meet she , yet will the man not tarry , as no reason be they shall : howbeit my opinion of she be that she be put into Ireland . the flowerdeluce be in Milford . thus for that your worship
