Lister and all the man in the ship be drown , save 5 . or 6 . the one half english , the other Spanish that save themselves with swim : but notwithstanding much of the good be save , and reserve for we , by sir Francis Godolphin , and the worshipful gentleman of the country there . my lord be very sorry for captain lister death , wish that he have lose his voyage to have save his life . the 29 . of December we meet with another ship , that tell we then same news , and that sir Martin Frobisher , and captain Reymond have take the admiral and vice - admirall of the fleet that we espy go to Tercera haven . but the admiral be sink with much leak , near to the idy stone , a rock that lie over against Plymouth sound , and the man be save . this ship also certify we that captain prestons ship have take a prize load with silver . my lord enter present into this ship , and go to Falmouth , and we hold on our course for Plymouth . at night we come near to the ram - head ( the next cape westwards from Plymouth sound ) but we be afraid to double it in the night , misdoubt the scantness of the wind . so we stand off to sea half the night , and towards morning have the wind more large , and make too little spare thereof , that partly for this cause , and partly through mistake of the land , we be drive so much to leeward , that we can not double that cape : therefore 3 Â° we return back again , and come into Falmouth haven , where we strike on ground in 17 . foot water : but it be a low ebb , and ready again to flow , and the ground soft , so as no hurt be do . here with gladness we set foot again upon the english ground ( long desire ) and refresh our self with keep part of Christmas upon our native soil .
