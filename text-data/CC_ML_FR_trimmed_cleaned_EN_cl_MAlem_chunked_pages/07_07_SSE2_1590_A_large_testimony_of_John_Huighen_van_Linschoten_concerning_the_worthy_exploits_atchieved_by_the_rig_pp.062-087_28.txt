think , and presume , that it be no other but a just plague purposely send by God upon the Spaniard , and that it may true be say , the take of the revenge be just revenge upon they , and not by the might or force of man , but by the power of God , as some of they open say in the lie of Tercera , that they 86 believe very God will consume they , and that he take part with the lutheran and heretic : say further that so soon as they have throw the dead body of the vice - admiral sir Richard Greenfield overboard , they very think that as he have a devilish faith and religion , and therefore the devil love he , so he present sink into the bottom of the sea , and down into hell , where he raise up all the devil to the revenge of his death : and that they bring so great storm and torment upon the Spaniard , because they only maintain the catholic and romish religion . such and the like blasphemy against God , they cease not open to utter , without be reprove of any man therein , nor for their false opinion : but the most part of they rather say and affirm , that of truth it must needs be so . as one of those indian fleet put out of Nova Spagna , there be 35 of they by storm and tempest cast away and drown in the sea , be 50 in all ; so that but 15 escape . of the fleet that come from Santo Domingo there be 14 cast away , come out of the channel of Havana , whereof the admiral and vice - admiral be two of they : and from terra firma in India there come two ship lade with gold and silver , that be take by the Englishman : and before the spanish army come to Corvo , the Englishman at time have take at the least 20 ship , that come from saint Domingo , India , Brasilia , etc and be all send into England . 87
