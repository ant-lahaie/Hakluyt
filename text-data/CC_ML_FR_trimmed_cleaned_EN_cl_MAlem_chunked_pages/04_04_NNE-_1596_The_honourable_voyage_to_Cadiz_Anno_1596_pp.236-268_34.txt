but yet if any will needs desire to be a little far satisfy , albeit it need not , yet then , thus much i dare say and affirm , that upon my knowledge , the chief cause why port saint mary , and the rest be leave untouched , be this : for that it be most certain know , that they be town not worth the salute of such a royal company , in which there be no manner of wealth in the world leave , more than bare house of stone , and stand wall , and may well have serve rather as a stale , perchance , to have entrap , then as a mean to have enrich . and it have be more than a suspicion of folly , for such a army as this , to have seek to fight with the air , and to have labour with great pain and charge , yea , and with 267 A . D . I596 . some evident danger too , to have overthrow that , which can very little or nothing have profit , be destroy : and yet now , can do as little harm be leave , as it be , untouched . and thus much for our journey to Cadiz : for the accident that happen by the way , for the win , spoil , and burn of the say town , for the overthrow of the spanish fleet there , and for all other by - matter that happen , as appendance to the same , both in the time of our abode there , as also at the very last hour of our come from thence . as for our return home , and our entrance into a part of portingal by the way , with the take , spoil , and burn of the town of Faraon there , and march into the spanish confine thereabouts , etc i mind to leave it to some other , who chance be to be present at the action , as my self be not , and shall | be off more sufficient ability to perform it .
