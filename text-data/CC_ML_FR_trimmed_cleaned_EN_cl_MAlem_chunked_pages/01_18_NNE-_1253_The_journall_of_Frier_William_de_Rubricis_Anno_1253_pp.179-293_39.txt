of his lord . i excuse my self also , that i be a monk , not have , nor receive , nor use any gold , or silver , or any other precious thing , save only our book , and the vestment wherein we serve God : and that this be the cause why i bring no present unto he , nor unto his lord . for i that have abandon my own good , can not be a transporter of thing for other man . than he answer very courteous , that be a monk , and so do , i do well : for so i shall observe my vow : neither do himself stand in need of aught that we have , but rather be ready to bestow upon we such thing as we our self stand in need of : and he cause we to sit down , and to drink of his milk . and present after he request we to say our devotion for he : and we do so . he inquire also who be the great prince among the Franckes ? and i say , the emperor , if he can enjoy his own dominion in quiet . no ( quoth he ) but the king of France . for he have hear of your highness by lord Baldwine of Henault . i find there also one of the knight of the temple , who have be in Cyprus , and have make report of all thing which he see there . then return we unto our lodging . and on the morrow we send he a flagon of muscadel wine ( which have last very well in so long a journey ) and a box full of biscuit , which be most acceptable unto he . and he keep our servant with he for that evening . the next morning he command i to come unto the court , and to bring the king letter and my vestment , and book with i : because his lord be desirous to see they . which we do accord , lade
