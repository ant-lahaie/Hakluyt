the 22 of August . god , the storm be at the high , and then the wind begin to slake , and come northerly withal , and then i reckon the westermost point of the river Pechora to be south of we 15 league . at a westsouthwest sun we set our main sail , and lie close by the wind , the wind be at northwest and by north , make but little way , because the billow go so high : at midnight we cast about , and the ship cape Northnortheast , make little way . Friday at noon we have the latitude in 70 degree 8 minute , and we sound , and have 29 fathom sand , and in manner stremy ground . at a west sun we cast about to the westwards , and a little after the wind come up at west . Saturday be calm : the latitude this day at noon be 70 degree and a terce , we sound here , and have nine and forty fathom and oz , which oz signify that we draw towards Nova Zembla . and thus we be out of all hope to discover any more to the eastward this year , we think it best to return , and that for three cause . the first , the continual north - east and northerly wind , which have more power after a man be pass to the eastwards of caninoze , then in any place that i do know in these northerly region . second , because of great and terrible abundance of ice which we see with our eye , and we doubt great store abide that in those part : i adventure already somewhat too far in it , but i thank God for my safe deliverance from it . three , because the night wax dark , and the winter begin to draw on with his storm : and therefore i resolve to take the first best wind that God shall send , and ply towards the bay of saint Nicholas , and to see if we may do any good there , if God will permit it .
