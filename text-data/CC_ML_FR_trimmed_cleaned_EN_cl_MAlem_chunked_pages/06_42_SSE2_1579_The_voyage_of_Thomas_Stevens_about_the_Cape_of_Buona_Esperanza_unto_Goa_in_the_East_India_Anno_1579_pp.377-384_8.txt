, nor by any other trial ! . the first sign of land be certain fowl which they know to be of India : the second , bough of palm and sedge : the three , snake swim on the water , and a substance which they call by the name of a coin of money , as broad and as round as a groat , wonderful print and stamp of nature , like unto some coin . and these two last sign be so certain , that the next day after , if the wind serve , they see land , which we do to our great joy , when all our water ( for you know they make no beer in those part ) and victual begin to fail we . and to goa we come the four and twenty day of October , there be receive with pass great charity . the people be tawny , but not disfigure in their lip 8c nose , as the moor and caffe of Ethiopia . they that be not of reputation , or at least the most part , go naked , save a apron of a span long , and as much in breadth before they , and a lace two finger broad before they , gird about with a string and no more : and thus they think they as well as we with all our trim . of the fruit and tree that be here i can now speak , for i shall make another letter as long as this . for hitherto i have not see a tree here , who like i have see in EurOpe ? the vine except , which nevertheless here be to no purpose , so that all the wine be bring out of Portugal . the drink of this country be good water , or wine of the palm tree , or of a fruit call Cocos . and this shall suffice for this time . if God send i my health , i shall have opportunity to write to you once again . now the length of my letter compel i to take my leave : and thus i wish your most prosperous health . from goa the ten of November , 1579 . our love son Thomas Stevens .
