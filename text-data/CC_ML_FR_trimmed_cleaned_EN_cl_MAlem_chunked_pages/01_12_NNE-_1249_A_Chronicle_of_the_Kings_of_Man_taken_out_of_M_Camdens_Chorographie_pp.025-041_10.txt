this time absent from man in the year 1217 . decease Nicolas bishop of the island , and be bury in Ulster , in the house of benchor , who Reginald succeed . i think it not amiss to report somewhat more concern the two foresay brethren Reginaldus and Olavus . REginald give unto his brother Olavus , the island call lodhus or Lewes , which be say to be large than the rest of the island , but almost destitute of inhabitant , because it be so full of mountain and quarrei , be almost no where fit for tillage . howbeit the inhabitant thereof do live for the most part upon hunt and fish . Olavus therefore go to take possession of this island , and dwell therein lead a poor life : and when he see that it will by no mean suffice for the sustentation of himself and his follower , he go bold unto his brother Reginald , who as then remain in the island , and speak on this wise unto he . my brother ( say he ) and my lord and king , you know that the 1223 - kingdom of the island pertain unto i by right of inheritance , howbeit because the lord have choose you to bear the sceptre , i do not envy that honour unto you , neither do it any whit grieve i that you be exalt unto this royal dignity . now therefore i beseech you to provide i some portion of land in the island , whereby i may honest live . for the island of Lewis which you give i be not sufficient for my maintenance . which his brother Reginald hear say that he will consult about the premise . and on the morrow , when Olavus be send for to parley , Reginald command he to be attach , and to be carry unto William king of Scotland , and with he to remain prisoner : and Olavus remain in prison almost for the space of 7 . year . but at the 7 . year end William king of Scot decease , and Alexander his son reign in his stead .
