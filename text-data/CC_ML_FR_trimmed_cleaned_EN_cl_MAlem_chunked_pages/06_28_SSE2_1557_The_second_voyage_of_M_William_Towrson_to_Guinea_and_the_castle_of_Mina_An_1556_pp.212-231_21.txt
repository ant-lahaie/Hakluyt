cape verde . the 24 we be direct under the tropic of cancer . the first day of May Henry Wilson our steward die : and the next day die John Underwood . the five day we be in the heighth of saint Michael . the 23 we have sight of a ship in the weather of we , which be a Frenchman of 90 ton , who come with we as stout and as desperate as may be , and come near we perceive that we have be upon a long voyage , and judge we to be weak , as in deed we be , come near we , and think to have lay we aboard , and there step up some of his man in armour , and command we to strike sail : whereupon we send they some of our stuff , crossebarre , and chainshot , and arrow , so thick , that it make the upper work of their ship fly about their ear , and we spoil he with all his man , and tear his ship miserable with our great ordinance , and then he begin to fall a stern of we , and to pack on his sail , and get away : and we see that , give he four or five good piece more for his farewell ; and thus we be rid of this french man , who do we not harm at all . we have aboard we a french man a trumpeter , who be sick , and lie in his bed , take his trumpet notwithstanding , and sound till he can sound no more , and so die . 230 the 28 we confer together , and agree to go into Severne , and so to Bristol , but the same night we have sight of the lizard , and by reason of the wind , we be not able to double the land end to go into Severne , but be force to bear in with the lizard . the 29 day , about nine of the clock in the morning , we arrive safe in Plymouth , and praise God for our good arrival .
