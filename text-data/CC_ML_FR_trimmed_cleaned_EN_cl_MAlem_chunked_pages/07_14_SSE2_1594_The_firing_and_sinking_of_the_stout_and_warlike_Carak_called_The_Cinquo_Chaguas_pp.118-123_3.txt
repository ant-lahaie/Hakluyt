they draw back as they do . when we have not man to enter , we ply our great ordinance much at they as high up as they may be mount , for otherwise we do they little harm , and by shoot a piece out of our forecastle be close by she , we fire a mat on her beakhead , which moor and more kindle , and run from thence to the mat on the bowsprit , and from the mat up to the wood of the bowsprit , and thence to the topsail yard , which fire make the Portugal abaft in the ship to stagger , and to make show of parley . but they that have the charge before encourage they , make show , that it may easy be put out , and that it be nothing . whereupon again they stand stiff to their defence . Anone the fire grow so strong , that i see it beyond all help , although she have be already yield to we . than we desire to be off from she , but have little hope to obtain our desire ; nevertheless we ply water very much to keep our ship well . in deed i make little other reckon for the ship , my self , and diverse hurt man , than to have end there with the carrack , but most of our people may have save themselves in boat . and when my care be most , by god providence only , by the burn asunder of our spritsail - yard with rope and sail , and the rope about the spritsail - yard of the carrack , whereby we be fast entangle , we fall apart , with burn of some of our sail which we have then on board . the exchange also be far from the fire , afterward be more easy clear , and fall off from abaft . and as soon as God have put we out of danger , the fire get into the forecastle , where , i think , be store of Benjamin , and such other like combustible matter , for 121 it flame and run over all the carrack at a instant in a manner . the Portugal be leap overboard in great number . then send i captain grant with the boat , with leave to use his own discretion in
