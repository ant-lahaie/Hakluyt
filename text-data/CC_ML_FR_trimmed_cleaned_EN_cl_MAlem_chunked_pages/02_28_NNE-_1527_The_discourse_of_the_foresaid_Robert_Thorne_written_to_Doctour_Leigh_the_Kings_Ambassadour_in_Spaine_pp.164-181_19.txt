God that into England i may come with your lordship , i will show some conjecture of reason , though against the generail opinion of cosmographer , by which shall appear this that i say not to lack some foundation . and till that time i beseech your lordship let it be put to silence : and in the mean season it may please God to send our two Englishman , that be go to the spicery , which may also bring more plain declaration of that which in this case may be desire . also i know i need not to have be so prolix in 180 the declaration of this card to your lordship , if the say card have be very well make after the rule of cosmography . for your lordship will soon understand it better than i , or any other that can have make it : and so it shall appear that i show delphinum natare . but for that i have make it after my rude manner , it be necessary that i be the declarer or gloss of my own work , or else your lordship shall have have much labour to understand it , which now with it also can be excuse , it be so gross do . but i know you look for no curious thing of i , and therefore i trust your lordship will accept this , and hold i for excuse . in other man letter that they write they crave pardon that at this present they write no large : but i must finish , ask pardon that at this present i write so large .
