shall divide the world between they two . and that all that shall be discover from cape Verde , where this card begins to be count in the degree of longitude , to 180 of the say scale of longitude , which be half the world towards the orient , and finish in this card right over against a little cross make at the say 180 degree , to be 173 the longitude hard to be find out . the king of Portugal . and all the land from the say cross toward the occident , until it join with the other cross in the orient , which contain the other hundred and eighty degree , that be the other half of the world , to be the king of Spain . so that from the land over against the say hundred and eighty degree until it finish in the three hundred and sixty on both the end of the card , be the jurisdiction of the king of Spain . so after this manner they divide the world between they . now for that these island of spicery fall near the term and limit between these prince ( for as by the say card you may see they begin from one hundred and sixty degree of longitude , and end in 215 ) it seem all that fall from 160 to 180 degree , shall be of portingal : and all the rest of Spain . and for that their cosmographer and pilot can not agree in the situation of the say island ( for the Portugal set they all within their 180 degree , and the Spaniard set they all without : ) and for that in measure , all the cosmographer of both part , or what other that ever have be can give certain order to measure the longitude of the world , as they do of the latitude : for that there be no star fix from east to west , as be the star of the pole from north to south , but all move with the move divine : no manner can be find how certainly it may be measure
