affinity either with the moscovian tongue , or with the tongue of any other nation . but whereas the Moscow - two 193 n vite pretend that there have be usual pay a pension or tribute unto himself and his predecessor out of the whole province , it be as incredible as the former .. about the begin of this tragical war , the Moscovite , to cloak his tyranny and ambition under some fair pretense , among other of his demand , make mention also of a tribute which shall be due unto he out of the bishop of dorpat his jurisdiction , whereof notwithstanding he can neither bring any just account , nor affirm any certainty : howbeit there be no man live to be find which either can tell of his own remembrance , or from the relation of other , that any such tribute be ever pay unto the Moscovite . what time therefore he refer all this negotiation unto the master of the livonian order , and command he to get what knowledge he can thereof from the man of dorpat , and urge the tribute , say if it be worth but one hair , that he will not remit it : at length it be find record in the ancient chronicle of dorpat , that beyond the memory of man , when the territory of Plesco contain nothing but wood and forest for wild beast , that the peasant of the liberty of dorpat call neuhus , by the consent of the russian borderer , enjoy beehive in the say wood , and pay every year in lieu thereof unto the russian governor , six shilling of livonian coin . but so soon as the russian have fell the wood and have build town and village in their place , the say pension cease together with the tree which be cut down . wherefore the say six shilling be never since that time either demand by the russes or pay by the livonians . Theise thing which i know concern the cause of the livonian war i think good to signify unto you . give the 22 . of may , in the year of our lord 1576 .
