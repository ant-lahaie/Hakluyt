fire and other provision , which the Spaniard throw in for that purpose : yet , God be thank , by the great and diligent foresight of the master it do not harm at all . in every of the galley there be about 200 . soldier : who together with the shot , spoil , rend , and batter the centurion very sore , shoot through her main mast , and slay 4 . of the man in the say ship , the one of they be the master ' mate . ten other person be hurt , by mean of splinter which the Spaniard shot : yea , in the end when their provision be almost spend , they be constrain to shoot at they hammer , and the chain from their slave , and yet God be thank , they receive no more damage : but by spoil and overweary of the Spaniard , the Englishman constrain they to ungrapple themselves , and get they go : and sure if there have be any other fresh ship or succour to have relieve and assist the centurion , they have slay , sink , or take all those galley and their soldier . the dolphin lie a loof off and dare not come near , while the other two small ship flee away , so that one of the galley go from the centurion and set upon the dolphin , which ship immediate be set on fire with their own powder , whereby both man and ship perish : but whether it be with their good will or no , that be not know unto the cen - turion , but sure , if it have come forward , and be a aid unto the centurion , it be to be suppose that it have not perish . five hour and a half this fight continue , in which time both be glad to depart only to breathe themselves , but when the Spaniard be go , they never dare return to fight : yet the next day six other galley come and look at they , but dare not at any hand meddle with they . thus God deliver they from the hand of their enemy , and give they the victory : for which they hearty praise he , and not long after safe arrive in London . there be present at this fight master John Hawes merchant , and sundry other of good account .
