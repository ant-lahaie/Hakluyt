for 2000 ducat , we shall go abroad in the town : which when we can not do , the say Padres find surety for we , that we shall not depart the country without the licence of the viceroy . it do spite the italian to see we abroad : and many marvel at our delivery . the painter be in the cloister of saint Paul , and be of their order , and like there very well . while we be in prison , both at ormuz and here , there be a great deal of our good pilfer and lose , and we have be at great charge in gift and otherwise , so that a great deal of our good be consume . there be much of our thing which will sell very well , and some we shall get nothing for . i hope in God that at the return of the viceroy , which be go to Chaul and to diu , they say , to win a castle of the moor , who return be think will be about easter , than we shall get our liberty , and our surety discharge . than i think it will be our best way , either one or both to return , because our trouble have be so great , and so much of our good spoil and lose . but if it please God that i come into England , by god help , i will return hither again . it be a brave and pleasant country , and very fruitful . the summer be almost all the year long , but the chief at Christmas . the day and the night be all of one length , very little difference , and marvelous great store of fruit . for all our great trouble , yet be we fat and well like , for victual be here plenty and good cheap . and here i will pass over to certify you of strange thing , until our meeting , for it will be too long to write thereof . and thus i commit you to God , who ever preserve you and we all . from goa in the east Indies the 25 of Januarie 1584 . you to command , Ralph Fitch . 464
