and realm must needs in time decay . the strangeness of the place be such for sundry thing 1 see , as if i will i can write each private point to thou . the cold be rare , the people rude , the prince so full of pride , the realm so store with monk and nun , and priest on every side : t34 the manner be so turquoise like , the man so full of guile , the woman wanton , temple stuff with idol that defile the seat that sacred aught to be , the custom be so quaint , as if i will describe the whole , i fear my pen will feint . in sum , i say i never see a prince that so do reign , nor people so beset with saint , yet all but vile and vain . wild irish be as civil as the russy in their kind , hard choice which be the best of both , each bloody , rude and blind . if thou be wise , as wise thou be , and will be rule by i , live still at home , and covet not those barbarous coast to see . no good befall a man that seek , and find no better place , no civil custom to be learn , where God bestow no grace . and true ill they do deserve to be belov â€™ d of God , that neither love nor stand in awe of his assure rod : which though be long , yet plague at last the vile and beastly sort of sinful wight , that all in vice do place their chief sport . a dieu friend Parker , if thou listen , to know the russes well , to Sigismundus book repair , who all the truth can tell : for he long erst in message go unto that savage king , send by the pole , and true report in each respect do bring , to he i recommend my self , to ease my pen of pain , and now at last do wish thou well , and bid farewell again .
