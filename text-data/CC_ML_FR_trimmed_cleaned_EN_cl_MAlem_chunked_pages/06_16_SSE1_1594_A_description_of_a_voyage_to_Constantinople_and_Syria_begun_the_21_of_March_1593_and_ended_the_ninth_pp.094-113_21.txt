say there be a small bone in the neck which will never be consume : or if he be eat by a beast , that bone will not consume , but of that bone will come another man ; and then the soul be restore again , he shall come into judgement , whereas now , the body be destroy , the soul shall not be judge : for their opinion be , that both body and soul must be unite together , as they have sin together , to receive 112 judgement ; and therefore the soul alone can . their seven precept which they keep so strict be not for any hope of reward they have after this life , but only that they may be bless in this world , for they think that he which break they shall have ill success in all his business . they say , the three chief religion in the world be of the christian , Jew , and turk , and yet but one of they true : but be in doubt which be the true of the three , they will be of none : for they hold that all these three shall be judge , and but few of they which be of the true shall be save , the examination shall be so straight ; and therefore , as i have say before , to prevent this judgement , they burn their body to ash . they say , these three religion have too many precept to keep they all well , and therefore wonderful hard it will be to make account , because so few do observe all their religion aright . and thus pass the time for the space of three month in this sea voyage , [ two i . 311 . ] we arrive at Venice the ten of June : and after i have see Padua , with other english man , i come the ordinary way over the Alps , by Augusta , Noremberg , and so for England ; where to the praise of God i safe arrive the nine of August 1595 . vi â€œ 3
