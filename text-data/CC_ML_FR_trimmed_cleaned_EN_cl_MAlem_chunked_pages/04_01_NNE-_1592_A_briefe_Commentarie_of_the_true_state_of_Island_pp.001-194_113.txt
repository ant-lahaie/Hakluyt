part these my labour employ in thy service , and accept they with that favourable and courteous mind which i have expect . and although they be not of such worth as i can wish , yet sith a willing mind be worth all , i will not therefore give over because i mistrust my self as one insufficient to contend for thy innocence , for thy reputation , and thy honour , my dear country . but rather whatsoever it be ( if it be aught ) and how mickle - soev which for my slender ability i be able to afford in thy defence , i think good not to suppress it : for i esteem not those man worthy of commendation , who despair to overgrow the limb of Lyco stout , neglect to cure their body of the gout . and in very deed , it do not whit repent i of my labour , if this little treatise shall tend neither to thou nor to my own disgrace . but if it shall any iv 193 n thing avail to thy honour or defence , i will think my travail right well bestow . yea , if by this my slender attempt i may but only excite other of thy child , and my native countryman , be far my superior both in learning and industry to take thy cause in hand , either now or hereafter , what reason be there why any man shall say that it be not worth my labour ? now , if they address themselves to write , howsoever my fame shall | be obscure , yet will i comfort my self with their excellency , who be like to impair my credit : for albeit a man ought to have speciali regard of his name and fame , yet be he to have more of his country , who dignity be safe and sound , we also must needs esteem our self to be in safety . write at holen hialtedale in island , the year of our lord 1592 . the 17 . of the kalend of May .
