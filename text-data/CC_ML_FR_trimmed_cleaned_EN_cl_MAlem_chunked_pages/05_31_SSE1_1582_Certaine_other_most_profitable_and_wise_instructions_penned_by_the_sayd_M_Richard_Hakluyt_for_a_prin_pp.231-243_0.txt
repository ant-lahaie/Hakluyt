remembrance for master S . to give he the better [ ii i . 161 . ] occasion to inform himself of some thing in England , and after of some other thing in turquoise , to the great profit of the common weal of this country . write by the foresaid master Richard Hakluyt , for a principali english factor at Constantinople 1582 . ince all man confess ( that be not barbarous breed ) that man be bear as well to seek the common commodity of their country , as their own private benefit , it may seem folly to persuade that point , for each man mean so to do . but wherein man shall seek the common commodity , and what way , and by what mean that be to be bring about , be the point or sum of the matter , since every good man be ready to employ his labour . this be to be do by a infinite sort of mean , as the number of thing be infinite that may be do for common benefit of the realm . and as the chief thing so to be do be diverse , so be they to be do by diverse man , as they be by wit and manner of education more fit , or less fit , for this and for that . and for that of many thing that tend to the common benefit of the state , some tend more , and some less , i find that no one thing , after one other , be great than clothe , and the thing incident to the same . And understand that you be off right good capacity , and become a factor at Constantinople , and in other part in turquoise , i find no man fit of all the english factor there , than you . and therefore i be so bold to put you in mind , and to tell you wherein with some endeavour you may chance to do your country much good , and give a infinite sort of the poor people occasion to pray for you here throughout the realm : this that i mean be in matter of cloth , etc 231
