afternoon the wind come about , and we go our course Southwest and by west , to go clear off the coast , we run that night sixteen league . the fourteen day in the morning be very foggy : but about twelve a clock we espy a Carvell of 60 . ton which be fish , and we send our skiff to he with five man , and all without any weapon save their oar . the Carvell for haste let slip her anchor , and set sail ; and they see that , fear that they shall not fetch she , will tarry for no weapon , and in the end overtake the Carvell , and make she to strike sail , and bring she away , although they have fourteen or fifteen man aboard , and every man his weapon , but they have not the heart to resist our man . 180 after they be come to we , they let fall their anchor , for we have cast anchor because the wind be not good : i cause then the skiff to come for i , and i go aboard of they to see that no harm shall be do to they , nor to take any thing but that which they may spare we for our money . so we take of they 3 . tapnets of fig , two small pot of oil , two pipe of water , four hogshead of saltfish which they have take upon the coast , and certain fresh fish which they do not esteem , because there be such store upon that coast , that in a hour and sometime less , a man may take as much fish as will serve great store Â° f twenty man a day . for these thing , and for some wine which we drink aboard or they , and three or Barbary , four great can which they send aboard of our ship , i pay they twenty and seven pistolet , which be twice as much as they willing will have take : and so let they go to their anchor
