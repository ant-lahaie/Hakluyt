 IN the year of Christ , 517. king Arthur in the second year of his reign , having subdued all parts of Ireland , sailed with his fleet into Island , and brought it and the people thereof under his subjection . The rumour afterwards being spread throughout all the other Islands , that no country was able to withstand him , Doldavius the king of Gotland , and Gunfacius the king of Orkney , came voluntarily unto him , and yielded him their obedience , promising to pay him tribute . The 
 Winter being spent , he returned into Britaine , and establishing his kingdom in perfect peace , he continued there for the space of twelve years .
