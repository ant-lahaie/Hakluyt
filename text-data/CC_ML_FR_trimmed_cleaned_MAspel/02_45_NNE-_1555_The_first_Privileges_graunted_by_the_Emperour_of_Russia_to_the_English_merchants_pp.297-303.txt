 JOhn Vasilivich , by the grace of God Emperor of Russia , great duke of Novogrode , Moscovia , etc. To all people that shall see , read , hear or understand these presents , greeting . Forasmuch as God hath planted all realms and dominions in the whole world with sundry commodities , so as the one hath need of the amity and commodities of the other , and by means thereof traffic is used from one to another , and amity thereby increased : and for that as among men nothing is more to be desired then amity , without the which no creature being of a natural good disposition can live in quietness , so that it is as troublesome to be utterly wanting , as it is perceived to be grievous to the body to lack air , fire , or any other necessaries most requisite for the conservation and maintenance thereof in health : considering also how needful merchandise is , which furnisheth men of all that which is convenient for their living and nourriture , for their clothing , trimming , the satisfying of their delights , and all other things convenient and profitable for them , and that merchandise brings the same commodities from diverse quarters in so great abundance , as by means thereof nothing is lacking in any part , and that all things be in every place ( where intercourse of merchandizes is received and embraced ) generally in such sort , as amity thereby is entered into , and planted to continue , and the injoyers thereof be as men living in a golden world : Upon these respects and other weighty and good considerations , us hereunto moving , and chiefly upon the contemplation of the gracious letters , directed from the right high , right excellent , and right mighty Queen Marry , by the grace of God Queen of England , France , etc. in the favour of her subject's , merchant's , the governor , consuls , assistants , and commonalty of merchant's adventurers for discovery of lands , etc.
