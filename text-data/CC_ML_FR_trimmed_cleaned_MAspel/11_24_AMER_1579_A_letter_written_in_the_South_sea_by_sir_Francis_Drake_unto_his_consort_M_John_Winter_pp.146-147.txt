Hereafter follows the copy of a letter written by sir Francis Drake ( being in the South sea of New Spaine , in his ship called The Pelican or the Golden Hind with the ship of Sant John de Anton , which he had taken ) to his companions in the other ships that were of his company , 146 
 and by foul weather separated from him , as I said before : The contents whereof were these : 
 Master Winter , if it pleases God that you should chance to meet with this ship of Sant John de Anton , I pray you use him well , according to my word and promise given unto them , and if you want any thing that is in this ship of Sant John de Anton , I pray you pay them double the valve for it , which I will satisfy again , and command your men not to do her any hurt : and what composition or agreement we have made , at my return into England I will by Gods help perform , although I am in doubt that this letter will never come to your hands : notwithstanding I am the man I have promised to be : Beseeching God , the Saviour of all the world , to have us in his keeping , to whom only I give all honour , praise and glory . What I have written , is not only to you M. Winter , but also to M. Thomas , M. Charles , M. Caube , and M. Anthonie , with all our other good friends , whom I commit to the tuition of him that with his blood redeemed us , and am in good hope , that we shall be in no more trouble , but that he will help us in adversity , desiring you for the Passion of Christ , if you fallen into any danger , that you will not despair of Gods mercy , for he will defend you and preserve you from all danger , and bring us to our desired haven , to whom be all honour , glory , and praise for ever and ever . Amen . Your sorrowful Captain , whose heart is heavy for you : Francis Drake .
