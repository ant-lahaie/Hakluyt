THe long and wondered voyage of Frier John de Plano Carpini , sent ambassador by Pope Innocentius the iiii . An. Do. 1246 to the great CAN of Tartaria ; wherein he passed through Bohemia , Polonia , Russia , and so to the city of Kiow upon Boristhenes , and from thence road continually post for the space of sixe months through Comania , over the mighty and famous rivers of Tanais , Volga , and laic , & through the countries of the people called Kangittae , Bisermini , Karakitay , Naimani , & so to the native country of the Mongals or Tartars , situate in the extreme Northeaster ne parts of all Asia : and thence back again the same way to Russia , and Polonia , and so to Room ; spending in the whole voyage among the said Tartars one whole year & above foure months : Taken out of the 32. book of Vincentius Beluacensis his Speculum historial .

 De situ & qualitate terrse Tartarorum . Cap. 3. Johannes de Plano Carpini . 
 E St in partibus Orientis terra , quae Mongal sive Tartari# Tartaria dicitur , in ea scilicet parte sita , in qua ^rz / rfo . 
 Oriens Aquiloni conjungi creditur . Ab Oriente quidem habet terram Kythaorum & etiam Solangorum , a meridie vero terram Sarracenorum . Inter | | Orientem & meridiem | | Vel Occi-terram Huynorum , & ab Occident provinciam Nay - dentem-manorum , ab Aquilone vero circundatur Oceano . In parte aliqua nimium est montuosa , & in aliqua campestris , sed tota fere admixta glarea plurimum arenosa , nec est in centesima parte fructuosa . Nec enim potest fructum portare , nisi aquis fluvialibus irrigetur , quae ibi sunt rarissimae . Unde nec villae nec aliquae civitates ibidem reperiuntur , excepta una , quae Cracurim appellatur , & satis bona esse dicitur . Nos quidem illam non vidimus , sed ad dimidiam dietam prope fuimus , cum apud Syram ordam , Syra orda . quae curia major Imperatoris eorum est , essemus . Licet autem aliis infructifera sit illa terra , tamen alendis pecoribus est apta . In aliqua ejus parte sunt aliquae sylvae modicae , alia vero sine lignis est omnind . Itaque 
 Tartarorum species . 
 Tonsura .

 Testes retro caudatce . 
 tam Imperator quam Principes , & omnes alii sedent , & cibaria sua decoquunt ad focum , de boum & equorum stercoribus factum . Ipse quoque aer inordinatus est ibidem mirabiliter . In media siquidem testate ibi tonitrua magna & fulgura fiunt , ex quibus plurimi occiduntur homines , & eodem quoque tempore cadunt ibidem maximae nives . Sunt & ibi ventorum frigidissimorum tam maximae tempestates , quid aliquando vix possunt equitare homines . Unde ciim ante ordam essemus ( sic enim apud eos stationes Imperatoris & Principum appellantur ) prae venti magnitudine in terra prostrati jacebamus , & videre propter pulveris magnitudinem minime poteramus . Nunquam ibi pluit in hyeme , sed frequenter in aestate , & tam modicum , ut vix posset aliquando pulverem & radicem graminum madefacere . Ibi quoque maxima grando cadit saepe . Unde cum Imperator electus in sede regni debuit poni , nobis in curia tunc existentibus , tanta cecidit grando , quod ex subita resolution plusquam CLX . homines in eadem curia fuerunt submersi . Res etiam & habitacula plura fuerunt deducta . Ibi etiam est in aestate subito calor magnus , & repent maximum frigus . 
 De forma & habitu & victu eorum . Cap. 4. 
 MOngalorum autem sive Tartarorum forma ab omnibus aliis hominibus est remota . Inter oculos enim , & inter genas , lati sunt plus caeteris , genae quoque satis prominent a maxillis . Nasum habent planum & modicum , oculos etiam parvos , & palpebras usque ad supercilia elevatas , ac super verticem in modum Clericorum coronas . Ex utraque parte frontis tondendo , plusquam in medio crines longos faciunt , reliquos autem sicut mulieres crescere permittunt . De quibus duas cordas faciunt , & unamquamque post aurem ligant . Pedes quoque modicos habent . Vestes tam virorum quam mulierum uno modo formatae sunt . Palliis vel cappis vel caputiis non utuntur . Tunicas vero miro modo formatas portant de buccaramo , vel purpurato , vel baldaquino . Pellicium habet pilos exterius , sed apertum est a posterioribus . Habet tamen caudulam 
 unam usque ad genua retro . Vestes suas non lavant , nec lavari permittunt , & maxim A tempore , quo tonitrua incipiunt , usquequo desinat illud tempus . Stationes Tabernacula habent rotundas in modum tentorii de virgulis & baculis subtilibus praeparatas . Supra vero in medio rotundam habent fenestram , unde ingrediatur lumen , & fumus exire possit : quia semper in medio faciunt ignem : parietes autem & tecta filtro sunt operta . Ostia quoque de filtro sunt facta . Harum quaedam subito solvuntur , & reparantur , & super summarios deferuntur : quaedam vero dissolvi non possunt sed in curribus portantur . Et quocunque sive ad bellum sive aliis vadunt , semper illas secum deferunt . In animalibus valde divites sunt , ut in Camelis Opesin pecore . & bobus , capris & ovibus . Jumenta & equos habent in tanta multitudine , quantam non credimus totum mundi residuum habere . Porcos autem & alias bestias non habent . Imperator ac Duces atque alii magnates in auro & argento ac serico & gemmis abundant . Cibi eorum sunt Victus . omnia , quae mandi possunt . Vidimus eos etiam manducare pediculos . Lac bibunt animalium , & in maxima quantitate , si habent , jumentinum . Porro in hyeme , quia nisi divites sint , lac jumentinum non habent , millium cum aqua decoquunt , quod tam tenue faciunt , ut illud bibere valeant . Unde quilibet eorum scyphum bibit unum vel duos in mane , & quandoque nihil amplius manducant in die . In sero autem unicuique datur de carnibus modicum , & bibunt ex eis brodium . Porro in aestate quando satis habent de lacte jumentino , carnes comedunt raro , nisi forte donentur eisdem , aut venatione bestiam aliquam ceperint vel avem . 
 De moribus eorum bonis & malis . Cap. 5. 
 HAbent autem mores quosdam quidem commendabiles , naeapxia . 
 & : quosdam detestabiles . Magis quip sunt obedientes Dominis suis , quam aliqui qui in mundo sint homines , sive religiosi sive seculares . Nam eos maxim reverentur , nec illis de facili mentiuntur verbis factisve : raro vel nunquam ad invicem contendunt , bellaque vel

 Temperantia . 
 Castitas . 
 Insolentia adversus exteros . 
 Iracundia . 
 Fraudulentia . 
 Sordes , 
 Temulentia , 
 rixas , vulnera vel homicidia nunquam inter eos contingunt . Praedones etiam ac fures rerum magnarum ibi nequaquam inveniuntur , ideoque stationes & currus eorum , ubi thesauros habent , seris aut vectibus non firmantur . Si aliqua bestia perdita fuerit , quicunque invenit eam vel dimittit , vel ad illos , qui ad hoc positi sunt , eam ducit . Apud quos ille , cujus est bestia , illam requirit , & absque ulla difficultate recipit . Unus alium satis honorat , & familiaritatem ac cibaria , quamvis apud eos sint pauca , liberaliter satis communicate . Satis etiam sunt sufferentes , nec cum jejunaverint uno die , vel duobus , omnino sine cibo , videntur impatientes , sed cantant & ludunt , ac si bene comedissent . In equitando multum sustinent frigus , calorem quoque nimium patiuntur . Inter eos quasi nulla placita sunt , & quamvis multum inebrientur , tamen in ebrietate sua nunquam contendunt . Nullus alium spernit , sed juvat & promovet , quantum congrue potest . Castae sunt eorum mulieres , nec aliquid inter eos auditur de ipsarum impudicitia . Quaedam tamen ex iis verba turpia satis habent & impudica . Porro erga caeteros homines iidem Tartari superbissimi sunt , omnesque nobiles & ignobiles quasi pro nihilo reputantes despiciunt . Unde vidimus in curia Imperatoris magnum Russiae ducem , & filium regis Georgianorum , ac Soldanos multos & magnos nullum honorem debitum recipere apud eos . Quinetiam Tartari eisdem assignati , quantumcunque viles essent illos antecedebant , semperque primum locum & summum tenebant , imo etiam saepe oportebat illos post eorum posteriora sedere . Praeterea iracundi sunt , & indignantis naturae , multum erga caeteros homines , & ultra modum erga eosdem mendaces . In principio quidem blandi sunt , sed postmodum ut Scorpiones pungunt . Subdoli enim & fraudulenti sunt , & omnes homines si possunt astutia circumveniunt . Quicquid mali volunt eis facere , miro modo occultant , ut sibi non possint providere , vel contra eorum astutias remedium invenire . Immundi quoque sunt in cibo & potu sumendis , & in casteris factis suis . Ebrietas apud illos est honorabilis : cumque multum aliquis 
 biberit , ibidemque rejicit , non ideo cessat , quin iterum bibat . Ad petendum maximi sunt exactores , tenacissimi retentores , parcissimi donatores . Aliorum hominum Aupotouia . occisio apud illos est pro nihilo . 
 De legibus & consuetudinibus eorum . Cap. 6. 
 HOc autem habent in lege sive consuetudine , ut Poena occidant viros & mulieres , si quando inveniantur in ^ulterii . 
 adulterio manifest . Similiter etiam virginem , si fornicata fuerit cum aliquo , occidunt eam cum eo . Praeterea si aliquis in praeda vel furto manifesto invenitur , sine ulla Furti . miseration occiditur . Item si quis denudavit consilia , maxim quando volunt ad bellum procedere , dantur ei super posteriora centum plagae , quanto majores unus Arcani rusticus cum magno baculo potest dare . Similiter cum evulgati . aliqui de minoribus offendunt in aliquo , non eis a majoribus suis parcitur , sed verberibus graviter affliguntur . 
 Matrimonio autem generaliter conjunguntur omnibus , Leges matri-etiam propinquis carnem , excepta matre & filia & sorore ex diorum . eadem matre . Nam sororem tantum ex patre , & uxorem quoque patris , post ejus mortem solent ducere . Uxorem etiam fratris alius frater junior , post ejus mortem , vel alius de parentela , tenetur ducere . Unde dum adhuc Andreas Dux essemus in terra , Dux quidam Russiae , Andreas nomine , Pussi# . apud Baty , quod equos Tartarorum de terra educeret , & v^e Her-alus venderet , accusatus est : quod licet non esset pro - rebus Mos _ batum , occisus est . Hoc audiens junior frater , & uxor chovipag . S.b. occisi , pariter venerunt ad praefatum Ducem , supplicare volentes , ne terra auferretur eisdem . At ille parvo praecepit , ut fratris defuncti duceret uxorem , mulieri quoque ut illum in virum duceret , secundum Tartarorum consuetudinem . Quae respondit , se potius occidi velle , quam sic contra legem facere . At ille nihilominus eam illi tradidit quamvis ambo renuerent , quantum possent . Itaque ducentes eos in lectum , clamantem puerum & plorantem super illam posuerunt , ipsosque commisceri pariter coegerunt . Denique post mortem maritorum , uxores Tartarorum non de facili solent ad secunda conjugia transire , nisi 
 forte quis velit sororiam aut novercam suam ducere . Nulla vero differentia est apud eos inter filium uxoris & concubinas , sed that pater quod vult unicuique . Itaque si sunt etiam ex Ducum genere , ita fit Dux filius concubinas , sicut Melich y filius uxoris legitimae . Unde cum rex Georgiae duos filios David fratres nUper ? unum scilicet nomine Melich legitimum , alterum Geor^ani . David ex adulterio natum haberet , moriensque terras 
 partem adulterae filio reliquisset , Melich , cui etiam ex parte matris regnum obvenerat , quia per foeminas tenebatur , perrexit ad Imperatorem Tartarorum , eo quod & David iter arripuerat ad illum . Ambobus igitur ad curiam venientibus , datisque maximis muneribus , petebat adulteras filius , ut fieret ei justitia secundum morem Tartarorum . Dataque est sententia contra Melich , ut David , qui major erat natu , subesset , ac terram a patre sibi concessam quiet itoXvmiia . ac pacifice possideret . Cumque Tartarorum unus habet uxorum multitudinem , unaquasque per se suam habet familiam & stationem . Et una die Tartarus comedit 
 & bibit & dormit cum una , altera die cum alia . Una tamen inter casteras major habetur , cum qua frequentius quam cum aliis commoratur . Et licet , ut dictum est , sint multe , nunquam tamen de facili contendunt inter se . 
 De superstitiosis traditionibus ipsorum . Cap 7. z^XUibusdam vero traditionibus indifferentia quaedam esse peccata dicunt , quas vel ipsi vel antecessores eorum confinxerunt . Unum est , cultellum in ignem figere , vel quocunque modo ignem cultello tangere , vel etiam de caldaria cum cultello carnes extrahere , vel cum securi juxta ignem incidere . Credunt enim , quod sic auferri debeat caput igni . Aliud est appodiare se ad flagellum , quo percutitur equus : ipsi enim non utuntur calcaribus . Item flagello sagittas tangere , juvenes aves capere vel occidere , cum fraeno equum percutere , os cum osse alio frangere . Itemque lac , vel aliquem potum aut cibum super terram effundere , in station mingere . Quod si voluntarii facit , occiditur , si autem aliter , oportet quod 100 
 pecuniam multam incantatori solvat , a quo purificetur . Qui etiam faciat , ut statio cum omnibus , quae in ipsa sunt , inter duos ignes transeat . Antequam sic purificetur , nullus audet intrare , nec aliquid de illa exportare . Praeterea si alicui morsellus imponitur , quem deglutire non possit , & illum de over suo ejicit , foramen sub station fit , per quod extrahitur , ac sine ulla miseration occiditur . Iterum si quis calcat super limen stationis Ducis alicujus , interficitur . Multa etiam habent his similia , quae reputant peccata . At homines occidere , aliorum terras invadere , ac res illorum diripere , & contra Dei praecepta vel prohibitiones facere , nullum apud eos est peccatum . De vita aeterna & damnation perpetua nihil sciunt . Credunt tamen , quod post mortem in alio seculo vivant , gregesque multiplicent , comedant & bibant , & caetera faciant , quae hic a viventibus fiunt . In principio lunationis vel in Cultus luna . plenilunio incipiunt , quic quid novi agere volunt , ipsamque Lunam Imperatorem magnum appellant , eamque deprecantes genua flectunt . Omnes , qui morantur in stationibus suis , oportet per ignem purificari . Quae scilicet purificatio fit hoc modo . Duos quidem ignes faciunt , & duas Lustrationis hastas juxta eos , unamque cordam in summitate hastarum rttus-ponunt . Ligantque super cordam illam quasdam de Bucaramo scissiones , sub qua scilicet corda & ligaturis inter illos ignes transeunt homines , ac bestiae ac stationes . 
 Sunt etiam duae mulieres , una hinc , & alia inde aquam projicientes , ac quaedam carmina recitantes . Caeterum si aliquis a fulgure occiditur , oportet praedicto modo per ignes transire omnes illos , qui in illis stationibus morantur . Statio siquidem ac lectus & currus , filtra & vestes , & quicquid talium habent , a nullo tanguntur , sed ab hominibus tanquam immunda respuuntur . Et ut breviter dicam , omnia purificari credunt per ignem . Unde quando lgw veniunt ad eos nuncii , vel Principes , aut qualescunque suPerst‘ll0sa personae , oportet ipsos & munera sua per duos ignes , ut purificentur , transire , ne fort veneficia fecerint , aut venenum seu aliquid mali attulerint .

 TErra quidem illa Orientalis , de qua dictum est supra , quas Mongal nominatur , quatuor quondam habuisse populos memoratur . Unus eorum Yeka Mongal , id est , magni Mongali vocabantur . Secundus Sumongal , id est , aquatici Mongali , qui seipsos appellabant Tartaros , a quodam fluvio per eorum terram current , qui Tartar nominatur . Tertius appellabatur Merkat . Quartus vero Metrit . Omnes unam personarum formam & unam linguam habebant him populi , quamvis inter se per Principes ac provincias essent divisi . In terra Yeka Mongal quidam fuit , qui vocabatur Chingis . Iste coepit robustus venator esse : didicit enim homines furari , & praedam capere . Ad alias terras ibat , & quoscunque poterat , captivabat , sibique associabat . Homines quoque suae gentis inclinavit ad se , qui tanquam Ducem sequebantur ipsum ad male agendum . Coepit autem pugnare cum Sumongal , sive cum Tartaris , & Ducem eorum interfecit , multoque bello sibi Tartaros omnes subjecit , & in servitutem redegit . Post haec cum istis omnibus contra Merkatas , juxta terram positos Tartarorum pugnavit , quos etiam bello sibi subjecit . Inde procedens contra Metritas pugnam exercuit , & illos etiam obtinuit . Audientes Naymani , qudd Chingis taliter elevatus esset , indignati sunt . Ipsi enim habuerant Imperatorem strenuum valde , cui dabant tributum cunctae nationes praedictae . Qui cum esset mortuus , filii ejus successerunt loco ipsius . Said quia juvenes ac stulti erant , populum tenere nesciebant , sed ad invicem divisi ac scissi erant . Unde Chingi praedicto modo jam exaltato , nihilominus in terras praedictas faciebant insultum , & habitatores occidebant , ac diripiebant praedam eorum . Quod audiens Chingis , omnes sibi subjectos congregavit . Naymani & Karakytay ex adverso similiter in quandam vallem strictam convenerunt , & commissum est praelium , in quo Naymani & Karakytay a Mongalis devicti sunt . Qui etiam pro 
 102 
 majori parte occisi fuerunt , & alii , qui evadere non potuerunt , in servitutem redacti sunt . In terra praedictorum Karakytaorum Occoday Cham , filius Chingischam , post - Occoday quam imperator fuit positus , quandam civitatem aedificavit , Cham. quam Chanyl appellavit . Prope quam ad Meridiem est quoddam desertum magnum , in quo pro certo sylvestres Homines sy / - homines habitare dicuntur , qui nullatenus loquuntur , vestres-nec juncturas in cruribus habent , & si quando cadunt , per se surgere non valent . Said tamen discretionem tantam habent , qudd filtra de lana Camelorum , quibus vestiuntur , faciunt & contra ventum ponunt . Et si quando Tartari pergentes ad eos vulnerant eos sagittis , gramina in vulneribus ponunt , & fortiter ante ipsos fugiunt .

Unde ciim illis volentibus aliquam impugnare regionem , minatur aliquis stragem , adhuc respondent : Olim etiam occisi non nisi septem remansimus , & tamen modo crevimus in multitudinem magnam , ideoque non terremur de talibus . Chingis autem & alii , qui remanserunt , in terram suam fugerunt . Cumque quievisset aliquantulum , praeparavit se rursus ad praelium , & processit contra terram Huyrorum .

 bus hominibus suis , contra Kythaos pariter processerunt , diuque contra illos pugnantes , magnam partem terrae illorum vicerunt , eorumque Imperatorem in civitatem suam majorem concluserunt . Quam & tam longo tempore obsederunt , quod exercitus expensae omnind defecerunt . Cumque jam quod manducarent , penitus non haberent , praecipit Chingischam suis , ut de decem hominibus unum ad manducandum darent . Illi vero de civitate machinis & sagittis viriliter contra istos pugnabant , & cum deficerent lapides , argentum & maxim liquefactum projiciebant . Civitas siquidem illa multis erat divitiis plena . Cumque diu Mongali pugnassent , & eam bello vincere non possent , unam magnam sub terra viam ab exercitu usque ad medium civitatis fecerunt , & prosilientes in medium ejus , contra cives pugnaverunt . Illi quoque , qui extra remanserant , eodem modo contra illos pugnabant . Denique concidentes portas civitatis intraverunt , & imperatorem cum pluribus occidentes urbem possederunt , aurumque & argentum , & omnes ejus divitias abstulerunt . Et cum illi terrae suos homines praefecissent , in terram propriam reversion sunt . Tunc primum Imperatore Kythaorum devicto , factus est Chingischam imperator . Quandam tamen partem illius terrae , quia posita erat in mari , nullatenus devicerunt usque hodie . Sunt autem Kytai homines pagani , habentes literam specialem , & etiam , ut dicitur , veteris & novi Testamenti scripturam . Habent etiam vitas patrum & eremitas & domos , in quibus orant temporibus suis , ad modum Ecclesiarum factas . Quosdam etiam sanctos habere se dicunt , & unum Deum colunt . Christum Jesum Dominum venerantur , & credunt vitam asternam , sed non baptizantur . Scripturam nostram honorant ac reverentur . Christianos diligunt , & eleemosynas plures faciunt , homines benigni satis & humani videntur . Barbam non habent , & in disposition faciei cum Mongalis in part concordant . Meliores artifices in mundo non inveniuntur in omnibus operibus , in quibus homines exercentur . Terra eorum est opulenta nimis in frumento & vino , auro & serico ac rebus caeteris .

Quas cum per multos interprets interrogassent , ubi viri terrae illius essent , responderunt , quod in illa terra quaecunque foeminae nascebantur , habebant formam humanam , masculi vero speciem caninam . Dumque moram in terra illa protraherent , Canes in alia fluvii parte convenerunt . Et cum esset hyems asperrima omnes se in aquam projecerunt . Post haec incontinenti sponte in pulverem volvebantur , sicque pulvis admixtus aquae super eos congelabatur , & ut ita pluries fecerunt , glacie super eos depressata , cum impetu magno contra Tartaros ad pugnam convenerunt . At vero cum illi sagittas super eos jaciebant , ac si super lapides sagittassent , retro sagittae redibant . Alia quoque arma eorum in nullo eos laedere poterant . Ipsi vero Canes insultum in Tartaros facientes , morsibus vulneraverunt multos , & occiderunt , sicque illos de suis finibus ejecerunt . Unde adhuc inter illos est proverbium de hoc facto , quod dicunt ad invicem ridendo : Pater meus vel frater meus i Canibus fuit occisus . Mulieres autem illorum , quas ceperant , ad terram suam duxerunt , & usque ad diem mortis eorum ibidem fuerunt . Cum autem exercitus ille Mongalorum rediret , venit ad terram Burithabeth , cujus habitatores pagani sunt , & hos Tartari bello vicerunt . Him consuetudinem habent mirabilem , imo potius miserabilem . Cum enim alicujus pater humanae naturae solvit debitum , congregant omnem parentelam , & comedunt eum . Him pilos in barba non habent , imo ferrum quoddam in manibus , sicut vidimus , portant , cum quo semper barbam , si forte crinis aliquis in ea crescit , depilant . Multum etiam deforms sunt .

Homines autem inter Caspios montes conclusi clamorem exercitus , ut creditur , audientes , montem frangere coeperunt , & cum alio tempore post decem annos redirent Tartari , montem confractum invenerunt . Cumque ad illos accedere attentassent , minime potuerunt : quia nubes quaedam erat posita ante ipsos , ultra quam ire nullatenus poterant . Omnino quip visum amittebant , statim ut ad illam perveniebant . Illi autem ex adverso credentes , qudd H Vide and Tartari ad illos accedere formidarent , insultum contra eos Hamsem fecerunt , sed statim ut pervenerunt ad nubem propter ^ua causam praedictam , procedere non potuerunt . Ac vero Haythonus antequam ad montes praedictos pervenirent Tartari , plus - cap . jo . quam per mensem per vastam solitudinem transierunt , & inde procedentes adhuc contra Orientem , plusquam per mensem per magnum desertum perrexerunt . Itaque pervenerunt ad quandam terram , in qua vias quidem tritas videbant , sed neminem invenire poterant . Tandem quaerentes , unum hominem cum uxore sua repererunt , quos in praesentiam Chingischam adduxerunt . Qui cum interrogasset illos , ubi homines illius terrae essent , respon - 
 derunt , quod in terra sub montibus habitarent . Tunc Troglodytas . Chingischam retenta uxore , misit ad eos virum illum , mandans illis , ut venirent ad ipsius mandatum . Qui pergens and illos , omnia narravit , quae Chingischam eis mandavit . Illi vero respondentes dixerunt , quod die tali venirent ad ipsum , ut facerent ejus mandatum . Ac ipsi medio tempore per vias occultas sub terra se congregantes , ad pugnam contra illos venerunt , & subito super eos irruentes , plurimos occiderunt . Solis quoque sonitus in Fabulosus ortu suo sustinere non poterant , imo tempore , quo Solis orientis oriebatur , oportebat eos unam aurem ad terram ponere , & sonitus-superiorem fortiter obturare , ne sonum illum terribilem audirent . Nec sic tamen cavere poterant , quin hac de causa plurimi ex eis interirent . Videns ergo Chingischam & sui , quod nihil proficerent , sed potius homines suos

 perderent , fugerunt , ac terra illa exierunt . Illum tamen virum cum uxore sua secum deduxerunt , qui etiam usque ad mortem in terra eorum fuerunt . Interrogati vero , cur in region sua sub terra soleant habitare , dixerunt , quod ibi quodam tempore anni , cilm oritur Sol , tantus fit sonitus , ut homines nulla ratione valeant sustinere . Quin etiam tunc in organis & tympanis caeterisque musicis instrumentis percutere solent , ut sonitum illum non audiant . 
 De statutes Chingischam , et morte ipsius , et filiis ac Ducibus . Cap. 13. 
 CUm autem de terra illa reverteretur Chingischam , defecerunt eis victualia , famemque patiebantur maximam . Tunc interiora unius bestiae recentia casu invenerunt : quae accipientes , depositis tantum stercoribus , decoxerunt , & coram Chingischam deportata pariter comederunt . Ideoque statuit Chingischam , ut nec sanguis , nec interiora , nec aliquid de bestia , quae manducari potest , projiciatur , exceptis stercoribus . Inde ergo in terram propriam reversus est , ibique leges & statuta edidit , quae Tartari inviolabiliter observant , de quibus scilicet jam alias superius dictum est . Post hoc ab ictu tonitrui occisus est . Habuit autem quatuor filios : Occoday vocabatur primus , Thossut Can secundus , Thiaday tertius , quarti nomen ignoramus . Ab his iiii . descenderunt omnes Duces Mongalorum . Primus filiorum Occoday est Cuyne , qui nunc est Imperator . Hujus fratres Cocten & Chyrenen . Ex filiis autem Thossut Can sunt Bathy , Ordu , Siba , Bora. Bathy post Imperatorem omnibus ditior est ac potentior . Ordu vero omnium Ducum senior . Filii Thiaday , sunt Hurin & Cadan . Filii autem alterius filii Chingischam , cujus ignoramus nomen , sunt , Mengu & Bithat & alii plures . Hujus Mengu mater Seroctan est , Domina magna inter Tartaros , excepta Imperatoris matre plus nominata , omnibusque potentior , excepto Bathy . Haec autem sunt nomina Ducum : Ordu , qui fuit in Polonia , & Hungaria , Bathy 108 
 quoque & Huryn & Cadan & Syban & Ouygat , qui omnes fuerunt in Hungaria . Said & Cyrpodan , qui adhuc est ultra mare contra quosdam Soldanos Sarracenorum , & alios habitatores terrae transmarinae . Alii vero remanserunt in terra , scilicet Mengu , Chyrenen , Hubilai , Sinocur , Cara , Gay , Sybedey , Bora , Berca , Corrensa . Alii quoque Duces eorum plures sunt , quorum nomina nobis ignota sunt . 
 De potestate Imperatoris & Ducum ejus . Cap. 14. 
 POrro Imperator eorum , scilicet Tartarorum , super omnes habet mirabile dominium . Nullus enim audet in aliqua morari parte , nisi ubi assignaverit ipse . Et ipse quidem assignat Ducibus ubi maneant . Duces autem loca Millenariis assignant , Millenarii vero Centenariis , & Centenarii Decanis . Quicquid autem eis praecipitur , quocunque tempore , quocunque loco , sive ad bellum , sive ad mortem , vel ubicunque , sine ulla obediunt contradiction . Nam etsi petit alicujus filiam virginem , vel sororem , mox ei sine contradiction exponunt eam , imo frequenter colligit virgins ex omnibus Tartarorum finibus , & si vult aliquas retinere , sibi retinet , alias vero that suis hominibus . Nuncios etiam quoscunque & ubicunque transmittat , oportet quod dent ei sine mora equos & expensas . Similiter undecunque veniant ei tributa vel nuncii , oportet equos & currus & expensas tribui . Ac vero nuncii , qui aliunde veniunt , in magna miseria , & victus & vestitus penuria sunt . Maximeque quando veniunt ad Principes , & ibi debent moram contrahere . Tunc adeo parum datur decem hominibus , quod vix inde possent duo vivere . Insuper & si aliquae illis injuriae fiunt , minime conqueri facile possunt . Multa quoque munera tam 4 principibus quam i caeteris ab illis petuntur : quae si non dederint , vilipenduntur , & quasi pro nihilo reputantur . Hinc & nos magnam partem rerum , quae nobis pro expensis a fidelibus erant datae , de necessitate oportuit in muneribus dare . Denique sic omnia sunt in

 De election Imperatoris Occoday , & legatione Ducis Bathy . Cap. 15. 
 MOrtuo , ut supra dictum est , Cyngischam , convenerunt Duces , & elegerunt Occoday , filium ejus Imperatorem . Qui habito consilio Principum , divisit exercitus . Misitque Bathy , qui in secundo gradu attingebat eum , contra terram Altissodan & contra terram Bisminorum , qui Sarraceni erant , sed loquebantur Comanicum . Qui terram illorum ingressus , cum eis pugnavit , eosque sibi bello subjecit . Quaedam autem civitas , nomine Barchin , diu restitit eis . Cives enim in circuitu civitatis foveas multas fecerant , propter quas non poterant a Tartaris capi , donec illas replevissent . Cives autem urbis Sarguit hoc audientes , exierunt obviam eis , sponte in manus eorum se tradentes . Unde civitas eorum destructa non fuit , sed plures eorum occiderunt , & alios transtulerunt , acceptisque spoliis , urbem aliis hominibus repleverunt , & contra civitatem Orna perrexerunt . Haec erat nimium populosa & divitiis copiosa . Erant enim ibi plures Christiani , videlicet Gasari & Rutheni , & Alani , & alii nec non & Sarraceni . Erat-que Sarracenorum civitatis dominium . Est etiam posita super quendam magnum fluvium , & est quasi portus , habens forum maximum . Cumque Tartari non possent eos aliter vincere , fluvium , qui per urbem currebat , praeciderunt , & illam cum rebus & hominibus submerserunt . Quo facto , contra Russiam perrexerunt , & magnam stragem in ea fecerunt , civitates & castra destruxerunt , & homines occiderunt . Kioviam , Russiae metropolin , diu obsederunt , & tandem ceperunt , ac cives interfecerunt . Unde quando per illam terram ibamus , innumerabilia capita & ossa hominum mortuorum , jacentia super campum , inveniebamus . Fuerat enim urbs valde magna & populosa , nunc quasi ad 
 110 
 1246. nihilum est redacta : vix enim domus ibi remanserunt ducentae , quarum etiam habitatores tenentur in maxima servitute . Porro de Russia & de Comania Tartari contra Hungaros & Polonos processerunt , ibique plures ex ipsis interfecti fuerunt , & ut jam superius dictum est , si Hungari viriliter restitissent , Tartari ab eis confusi recessissent . 
 Inde revertentes in terram Morduanorum , qui sunt Pagani , Morduani . venerunt , eosque bello vicerunt . Inde contra Byleros , id est , contra Bulgariam magnam profecti sunt , & ipsam om - Bulgaria nino destruxerunt . Hinc ad Aquilonem adhuc contra maSna-Bastarcos , id est Hungariam magnam processerunt , & illos Hungaria etiam devicerunt . Hinc amplius ad Aquilonem pergentes , ad Parossitas venerunt , qui parvos habentes stomachos & Parasita . os parvum , non manducant , sed carnes decoquunt , quibus decoctis , se super ollam ponunt , & fumum recipiunt , & de hoc solo reficiuntur , vel si aliquid manducant , hoc valde modicum est . Hinc & ad Samogetas venerunt , qui tan - Samogeta . tum de venationibus vivunt , & tabernacula vestesque tantum habent de pellibus bestiarum . Inde ad quandam terram super Oceanum pervenerunt , ubi monstra quaedam invene - Monstra runt , quae per omnia formam humanam habebant , sed aluiimarta-pedes bovinos , & caput quidem humanum , sed faciem ut canis . Duo verba loquebantur ut homines , tertio latrabant ut canes . Hinc redierunt in Comaniam , & usque nunc ibi morantur ex eis quidam .

 De legatione Cyrpodan Ducis . Cap. 16. 
 EO tempore misit Occoday Can Cyrpodan Ducem cum Expeditio exercitu ad meridiem contra Kergis , qui & illos bello superavit . Him homines sunt Pagani , qui pilos in barba non habent . Quorum consuetudo talis est , ut cum alicujus pater moritur , prae dolore quasi unam corrigiam in signum lamenti ab aure usque aurem de fancy sua levet . His autem devictis , Dux Cyrpodan contra Armenios ivit ad meridiem cum suis . Qui cum transirent per deserta 
 quaedam , monstra invenerunt , effigiem humanam habentia , quae non nisi unum brachium cum manu in medio pectoris , & unum pedem habebant , & duo cum uno arcu sagittabant , adeoque fortiter currebant , quod equi eos investigare non poterant . Currebant autem super unum pedem illum saltando , & cum essent fatigati , taliter eundo ibant super manum & pedem , se tanquam in circulo revolvendo . Cumque sic etiam fesse essent , iterum secundum priorem Cyclopedes . modum currebant . Hos Isidorus Cyclopedes appellat . Et ex eis Tartari nonnullos occiderunt . Et sicut nobis a Ruthenis Clericis in curia dicebatur , qui morantur cum Imperatore praedicto , plures ex eis nuncii venerunt in legatione ad curiam Imperatoris , superius annotati , ut possent habere Armenia IA pacem cum illo . Inde procedentes venerunt in Armeniam , Geor^a sub - qUam bello devicerunt , & etiam Georgiae partem . Alia acta ' vero pars venit ad mandatum eorum , & singulis annis 
 dederunt , & adhuc daunt ei pro tributo xx . millia Yper-perarum . Hinc ad terram Soldani Deurum , potentis & magni , processerunt , cum quo etiam pugnantes , ipsum devicerunt . Denique processerunt ulterius debellando ac Soldanus vincendo usque ad terram Soldani Halapiae , & nunc etiam

 Qualiter Tartari se habent in pneliis . Cap. 17. 
 ORdinavit Chingischam Tartaros per Decanos & centenarios & millenarios . Decem quoque millenariis praeponunt unum , cunctoque nihilominus exercitui duos aut tres Duces , ita tamen ut ad unum habeant respectum . Cumque in bello contra aliquos congrediuntur , nisi com-112 
 muniter cedant , omnes qui fugiunt , occiduntur . Et si unus aut duo , vel plures ex decem audacter accedunt ad pugnam , alii vero ex illo Denario non sequuntur , similiter occiduntur . Said etiam si unus ex decem vel plures capiuntur , socii eorum si non eos liberant , ipsi etiam occiduntur . Porro arma debent habere talia . Duos arcus vel Armatura . unum bonum ad minus . Tresque pharetras sagittis plenas , & unam securim & funes ad machinas trahendas . Divites autem habent gladios in fine acutos , ex una parte tantum incidentes , & aliquantulum curvos . Habent & equos armatos , crura etiam tecta , galeas & loricas . Verum loricas & equorum cooperturas quidam habent de corio , super corpus artificiose duplicato vel etiam triplicato . Galea vero superius est de chalybe , vel de ferro : sed illud , quod in circuitu protegit collum & gulam , est de corio . Quidam autem de ferro habent omnia supradicta , in hunc modum formata . Laminas multas tenues ad unius digiti latitudinem & palmas longitudinem faciunt , & in qualibet octo foramina parvula facientes , interius tres corrigias strictas & forts ponunt . Sicque laminas , unam alii quasi per gradus ascendendo , supponunt . Itaque laminas ad corrigias , tenuibus corrigiolis per foramina praedicta immissis , ligant , & in superiori parte corrigiolam unam ex utraque parte duplicatam cum alia corrigiola consuunt , ut laminae simul bene firmiterque cohaereant . Haec faciunt tam ad cooperturas equorum , quam ad armaturas hominum . Adeoque faciunt illa lucere , quod in eis potest homo faciem suam videre . Aliqui vero in collo ferri lanceae uncum habent , cum quo de sella , si possunt , hominem detrahant . Sagittarum eorum ferramenta sunt acutissima , ex utraque parte quasi gladius biceps incidentia , semperque juxta pharetram portant limas ad acuendum sagittas . Habent vero scuta de viminibus , aut de virgulis facta . Said non credimus , quod ea soleant portare , nisi ad castra & ad custodiam Imperatoris ac prin - 
 cipum , & hoc tantum de nocte . In bellis astutissimi sunt : Usus bellorum . quia per annos xlii . cum caeteris gentibus dimicarunt . 
 Cum autem ad flumina pervenerunt , majores habent Mos tranandi rotundum ac leave corium , in cujus summitate per circui - flumina .

 tum ansas crebras facientes , funem imponunt ac stringunt , ita quod in circuitu quasi ventrem efficiunt , quem vestibus ac rebus caeteris replent , fortissimeque ad invicem comprimunt . In medio autem ponunt sellas & alias res duriores : ibi quoque sedent homines . Hujusmodi navim ad equi caudam ligant , & hominem , qui equum regat , pariter natare faciunt , vel habent aliquando duos remos , cum quibus remigant . Equo igitur in aquam impulso , omnes alii equi sequuntur illum , & sic transeunt fluvium . Pauperior autem quilibet unam bursam vel saccum de corio bene consutum habet , in quo res suas omnes imponit , & in summitate fortiter ligatum , ad equi caudam suspendit , sicque modo praedicto transit .

 Qualiter resistendum sit eis . Cap. 18. 
 NUllam aestimo provinciam esse , quae per se possit eis resistere : quia de omni terra potestatis suae solent homines ad bellum congregare . Et siquidem vicina provincia non vult eis opem far , quam impugnant , delentes illam , cum hominibus , quos ex illa capiunt , contra aliam pugnant . Et illos quidem in acie primos ponunt , & si male pugnant , ipsos occidunt . Itaque si Christiani eis resistere volunt , oportet qudd Principes ac rectores terrarum in unum conveniant , ac de communi consilio eis resistant . Habeantque pugnatores arcus forts & balistas , quas multum timent , sagittasque sufficientes , dolabrum quoque de bono ferro , vel securim cum manubrio longo . Ferramenta vero sagittarum more Tartarorum , quando sunt calida , temperare debent in aqua , cum sale mixta , ut fortia sint ad penetrandum illorum arma . Gladios etiam & lanceas cum uncis habeant , qui volunt , ad detrahendum illos de sella , de qua facillimi cadunt . Habeant & galeas & arma caetera , ad protegendum corpus & equum ab armis & sagittis eorum , & si qui non ita sunt armati , debent more illorum post alios ire , & contra ipsos arcubus vel balistis trajicere . Et sicut dictum est supra de Tartaris , debent acies suas ordinare , ac legem pugnantibus imponere . Quicunque conversus fuerit ad praedam ante victoriam , ” 4 
 maximam debet poenam subire : talis enim apud illos occiditur absque miseration . Locus ad praelium , si fieri potest , eligendus est planus , ut undique possint videre , nec omnes debent in unum convenire , sed acies multas & divisas , nec tamen nimis distantes ab invicem , facere . Contra illos , qui prim veniunt , debent unam aciem mittere , & alia parata sit ad juvandum illam opportuno tempore . Habeant & speculatores ex omni parte , qui videant , quando veniunt acies caeterae . Nam ided semper debent aciem contra aciem , ut ei occurrant , mittere , quoniam illi semper nituntur adversarios in medio concludere . Hoc autem acies caveant , ne si etiam illi fugere videantur , diu post illos currant , ne fort , sicut facere solent , ipsos ad paratas insidias trahant : quia plus fraudulentia quam fortitudine pugnant . Et iterum ne fatigentur equi eorum : quia nostri multitudinem non habent equorum . Tartari verb quos equitant die una , non ascendunt tribus diebus , vel quatuor postea . Praeterea si cedunt Tartari , non ideo debent nostri recedere , vel ab invicem separari : quoniam hoc simulando faciunt , ut exercitus dividatur , & sic ad terrae destructionem liberi ingrediantur . Caeterum Duces nostri die noctdque facere debent exercitum custodiri : nec jacere spoliati , sed semper ad pugnam parati : quia Tartari quasi Daemons semper vigilant , excogitantes artem nocendi . Porro si aliqui Tartarorum in bello de suis equis projiciuntur , statim capiendi sunt , quia quando sunt in terra fortiter sagittant , & equos hominesque vulnerant . 
 De itinere Fratris Johannis de Plano carpini usque ad primam custodiam Tartarorum . Cap. 19. 
 NOs igitur ex mandato sedis Apostolicae cum iremus ad Orientis nationes , elegimus prius ad Tartaros proficisci : quia timebamus , ne per illos in proximo Ecclesiae Dei periculum immineret .

Datisque literis & bono conductu , fecit & expensas nobis dari per curias & civitates ejus , quo usque ad Ducem Slesiae Bolezlaum , nepotem ejus , veniremus , qui etiam erat nobis familiaris & notus . Hinc & ipse nobis similiter fecit , donec veniremus ad Conradum , Ducem * Lautisciae , ad quem tunc , Dei gratia nobis favente , venerat Dominus Wasilico , Dux Russiae , i quo etiam plenius de facto audivimus Tartarorum : quia nuncios illuc miserat , qui jam redierant ad ipsum . Audito autem , quod oporteret nos illis munera dare , quasdam pelles castorum & aliorum animalium fecimus emi , de hoc , quod datum nobis fuerat in eleemosynam ad subsidium viae . Quod agnoscentes Dux Conradus & * Ducissa Cracoviae , & Episcopus & quidam milites , plures etiam nobis dederunt hujusmodi pelles . Denique Dux Wasilico a Duce Cracoviae , & Episcopo atque Baronibus pro nobis attent rogatus , secum nos in terram suam duxit , & ut aliquantulum quiesceremus , aliquot diebus nos in expensis suis detinuit . Et cum rogatus a nobis , fecisset Episcopos suos venire , legimus eis literas Domini Papae , monentis eos , ad sanctae matris Ecclesiae unitatem redire . Ad idem quoque nos ipsi monuimus eos , & induximus , quantum potuimus , tam Ducem quam Episcopos & alios . Said quia Dux Daniel , frater Wasiliconis praedicti , praesens non erat , quoniam ad Baty profectus erat , non potuerunt eo tempore finali ter respondere . Post haec Dux Wasilico transmisit nos usque in Kioviam metropolin Russiae , cum serviente uno . Ibamus tamen in periculo capitis semper propter Lituanos , qui saepe faciebant insultum super terram Russiae , & in illis maxim locis , per quos debebamus transire . At per praedictum servientem eramus securi a Ruthenis , quorum etiam maxima pars occisa vel captivata erat a Tartaris . Porrd in Danilone usque ad mortem tunc infirmati fuimus . Nihilominus tamen in vehiculo per nivem & frigus magnum trahi nos fecimus . Ciim ergo Kioviam pervenimus , habuimus de via nostra consilium cum millenario ac caeteris ibidem nobilibus . Qui responderunt nobis , qudd si duceremus equos illos , quos tunc 116 
 habebamus , ad Tartaros , cbm essent magnae nives , morer - 
 entur omnes : quia nescirent herbam fodere sub nive , Pabulum equo-sicut equi faciunt Tartarorum , nec inveniri posset aliquod rum artanc-pro eis ad manducandum , ciim Tartari nec stramina nec fcenum habeant , nec pabulum . Itaque decrevimus eos illic dimittere cum duobus pueris , deputatis eorum custodiae . Ideoque nos oportuit millenario dare munera , ut ipsum haberemus propitium , ad dandum nobis equos subductitios & conductum . Secundo igitur die post festum Purificationis cepto itinere , venimus ad villam Canovae , quae sub Tartaris erat immediate . Cujus praefectus nobis dedit equos & conductum usque ad aliam , in qua reperimus praefectum Micheam , omni malitia plenum . Qui tamen Micheas acceptis a nobis muneribus secundum velle suum , duxit 
 nos usque ad primam custodiam Tartarorum .

 CUm ergo in prima sexta feria post diem cinerum , Sole ad occasum tendente , hospitaremur . Tartari super nos armati horribiliter irruerunt , quaerentes cujusmodi homines essemus : cumque respondissemus , qudd Domini Papae nuncii essemus , quibusdam cibariis a nobis acceptis , continued discesserunt . Porro mane facto , ciim surgentes aliquantulum processissemus , majores illorum , qui erant in custodia , nobis occurrerunt , interrogantes , cur ad eos veniremus ? & quid negotii haberemus ? Quibus respondimus , Domini Papae nuncii sumus , qui Christianorum pater est ac Dominus . Hic nos idcirco tam ad Regem quam ad Principes , omnesque Tartaros , mittit , quia placet ei , quod omnes Christiani Tartarorum sint amici , & pacem habeant cum ipsis .

Super his etiam rogat , ut ei rescribant , quid facere velint de caetero , & quae sit eorum intentio . Quibus auditis , & intellectis , dixerunt Tartari , se velle equos nobis subductitios usque ad Corrensam & ducatum praebere . Statimque munera petierunt , & a nobis acceperunt . Equis igitur acceptis , de quibus descenderant ipsi , cum eorum ducatu ad Corrensam arripuimus iter eundi . Ipsi tamen velociter equitantes , nuncium unum praemiserunt ad praefatum Ducem cum his verbis , quae dixeramus eisdem . Est autem Dux iste Dominus omnium , qui positi sunt in custodia contra omnes Occidentis populos , ne forte subitd & improviso irruant aliqui super illos . Et iste dicitur habere sexaginta millia hominum armatorum sub se .

Quibus respondimus , quod Dominus Papa non mittebat aliqua munera ; quia non erat certus , quod ad illos pervenire possemus , & insuper veneramus per loca valde periculosa . Veruntamen in quantum de his , quae habebamus ex gratia Dei & Domini Papae ad victum nostrum , sicut poterimus , honorabimus ipsum .

Quibus respondimus : quod propter hoc , ne de tali re suspectos redderemus nos , transiremus . Cum igitur ad Ordam pervenissemus , interrogati a procuratore ipsius Eldegay , cum quo inclinare vellemus ? idem quod prius apud Corrensam respondimus , datisque muneribus & acceptis , auditis etiam itineris causis , introduxerunt nos in stationem Principis , prius facta inclination , & audita de limine non calcando , sicut prius , admonition . Ingressi autem flexis genibus , verba nostra proposuimus , deinde literas obtulimus , & ut nobis darentur interprets ad transferendum eas , rogavimus . Qui etiam in die Parasceve dati fuerunt nobis , & eas in litera Ruthenica , Sarracenica & in Tartarica diligenter cum ipsis transtulimus . Haec interpretatio Bathy praesentata fuit : quam & legit , & attent notavit . Tandem ad nostram stationem reducti fuimus , sed nulla cibaria nobis dederunt , nisi semel aliquantulum millii in una scutella , scilicet in prima nocte quando venimus . Iste Bathy magnifice se gerit , habens ostiarios & omnes officiales ad modum Imperatoris , & sedet in eminenti loco velut in throno cum una de uxoribus suis . Alii vero tam fratres sui & filii , quam alii majores inferius sedent in medio super bancum , & homines caeteri post eos in terra deorsum , sed viri a dextris , & fceminae a sinistris . Tentoria quoque de panno lineo habet pulchra & magna satis , quae fuerunt Hungariae regis . Nec aliquis ad ejus tentorium audet accedere praeter familiam , nisi vocatus , quantumcunque sit potens & magnus , nisi forte sciatur , quod sit voluntas ipsius . Nos etiam dicta causa sedimus a sinistris : Sic etenim & omnes nuncii faciunt in eundo : sed in redeundo ab Imperatore , semper ponebamur a dextris . In medio ponitur mensa ejus prope ostium stationis , super quam apponitur potus in aureis & 
 120 
 1246. argenteis vasis . Nec unquam bibit Bathy , vel aliquis Ejusdem Tartarorum Princeps , maxim quando in publico sunt , bibendi ad nisi cantetur ei vel cytharizetur . Et cum equitat , semper portatur solinum , vel tentoriolum super caput ejus in hasta . Sicque faciunt cuncti majores Principes Tartarorum , & etiam uxores eorum . Idem vero Bathy satis est hominibus Authoritas . suis benignus , valde tamen ab eis timetur , & in pugna est crudelissimus , sagax est multum & astutissimus in bello : quia jam pugnavit tempore longo .

 & exivit ad nos procurator Bathy praedictus , dicens jubentur ad ex parte ipsius , qudd ad Imperatorem Cuyne in terram ipsorum iremus , retentis quibusdam ex nostris sub hac specie , qudd vellent eos remittere ad Dominum Papam , quibus & literas dedimus de omnibus factis nostris , quas deferrent eidem . Said cum rediissent usque ad Montii Ducem supradictum , ibi retenti fuerunt usque ad reditum nostrum . Nos autem in die Paschae officio dicto , & facta comestione qualicunque cum duobus Tartaris , qui nobis apud Corrensam fuerant assignati , cum multis lacrymis recessimus , nescientes utrum ad mortem vel vitam pergeremus . Eramus tamen ita infirmi corpore , qudd vix poteramus equitare . In tota siquidem illa quadragesima fuerat cibus noster millium cum aqua & sale tantum , & in aliis similiter diebus jejuniorum . Nec habebamus aliquid ad bibendum praeter nivem in caldario liquefactam . Ibamus autem per Comaniam equitando fortissime , quoniam habebamus equos recentes quinquies aut pluries in die , nisi quando per deserta ibamus , & tunc equos meliores atque fortiores , qui possent continuum sustinere laborem , accipiebamus . Et hoc ab ineunte quadragesima usque ad octo dies post Pascha .

 Jeroslaus , Dux Russia . qua etiam homines pauci morantur propter aquae defectum . Unde homines Jeroslai , Ducis Russiae , cum ad ipsum in terram Tartarorum perrexerunt , plures eorum in illo deserto prae siti mortui sunt . In hac etiam terra & in Comania multa invenimus capita & ossa mortuorum hominum , super terram jacentia tanquam sterquilinium . Per hanc itaque terram ivimus ab octo diebus post Pascha fere usque ad Ascensionem Dominicam . Hujusque habitatores Pagani erant , & tam ipsi quam Comani non laborabant , sed tantum de animalibus vivebant , nec domos aedificabant , sed in tabernaculis habitabant . Istos etiam Tartari deleverunt , & habitabant in terris eorum , illique qui remanserunt , redacti sunt in servitutem ipsorum . 
 Qualiter ad primam Imperatoris futuri curiam devenerunt . Cap. 24. 
 Terra Biserminorum . TO ) Qrrd de terra Kangittarum intravimus terram Biser-JT minorum , qui loquuntur lingua Comanica , sed legem tenent Sarracenorum . In hac etiam terra invenimus urbes innumeras cum castris dirutas , villasque 
 Altisoldanus . multas desertas . Hujus Dominus dicebatur Altisoldanus , qui cum tota sua progeny a Tartaris est destructus . 
 Montes maximi . Habet autem haec terra montes maximos . Et a meridie quidem habet Hierusalem & Baldach , totamque Sarracenorum terram . Atque in finibus illis propinquis 122

In illa vero moratur Syban , frater Bathy . Per hanc ivimus a festo Ascensionis dominicae fere usque ad viii . dies ante festum sanet . Johan . Baptistae . Deinde ingressi sumus terram nigrorum Kythaorum , in qua Imperator aedificavit domum , ubi etiam vocati fuimus ad bibendum . Et ille , qui erat ibidem ex parte imperatoris , fecit majores civitatis , & etiam duos filios ejus , plaudere coram nobis . Hinc exeuntes , quoddam mare parvum invenimus , in cujus littore quidam existit mons parvus . In quo scilicet monte quoddam foramen esse dicitur , unde in hyeme tam maximae tempestates ventorum exeunt , qudd homines inde vix & cum magno periculo transire possunt . In aestate vero semper quidem ibi ventorum sonitus auditur , sed de foramine tenuiter egreditur . Per hujus maris littora plurimis diebus perreximus , quod quidem licet non multum sit magnum , plures insulas habet , & illud in sinistris dimisimus . In terra vero illa habitat Ordu , quem omnium Ducum Tartarorum antiquiorem diximus , & est orda , sive curia patris ipsius , quam inhabitat , & regis una de uxoribus ejus . Consuetudo enim est apud Tartaros , qudd principum & majorum curiae non delentur , sed semper ordinantur aliquae mulieres , quae illas regant , eisque donariorum parts , sicut Dominis earum dari solebant , dantur . Sic tandem ad primam Imperatoris curiam venimus , in qua erat una de uxoribus ipsius . 
 Qualiter ad ipsum Cuyne , Imperatorem futurum pervenerunt . Cap. 25. 
 AT vero quia nondum Imperatorem videramus , noluerunt vocare nos , nec intromittere ad Ordam ipsius , sed nobis in tentorio nostro secundum morem Tartarorum valde bene serviri fecerunt , & ut quiesceremus , nos ibidem per unam diem tenuerunt . Inde procedentes in vigilia sanctorum Petri & Pauli , terram Naymanorum 123

 intravimus , qui sunt Pagani . In ipsa vero die Apostolorum ibidem cecidit magna nix , & habuimus magnum frigus . Haec quidem terra montuosa & frigida est supra modum , ibique de planicie reperitur modicum . Istae quoque duae nationes praedictae non laborabant , sed sicut & Tartari in tentoriis habitabant , quas & ipsi deleverant , per hanc etiam multis diebus perreximus . Deinde terram Mongalorum intravimus , quos Tartaros appellamus . Per has itaque terras , ut credimus , tribus septimanis equitando fortiter ivimus , & in die Beatae Mariae Magdalenae ad Cuyne Imperatorem electum pervenimus . Ideo autem per omnem viam istam valde festinavimus , quia praeceptum erat Tartaris nostris , ut cito nos deducerent ad curiam solennem , jam ex annis pluribus indictam , propter ipsius Imperatoris electionem . Idcirco de mane surgentes , ibamus usque ad noctem sine comestione , & saepius tam tarde veniebamus , quod non comedebamus in sero , sed quod manducare debebamus in vespere , dabatur nobis in mane . Mutatisque frequentius equis , nullatenus parcebatur eis , sed equitabamus velociter ac sine intermission , quantum poterant equi trotare . 
 Qualiter Cuyne Fratres Minores suscepit . Cap. 26. 
 Cuyne in lega - / um autem pervenimus ad Cuyne , fecit nobis dari tos benignitas . tentorium & expensas , quales Tartaris dare solent , nobis tamen melius quam aliis nunciis faciebant . Ad ipsum autem vocati non fuimus , eo quod nondum electus erat , nec adhuc de imperio se intromittebat . Interpretatio tamen literarum Domini Papae , ac verba etiam a nobis dicta , a praedicto Baty erant ei mandata . Cum ergo stetissemus ibi per quinque vel sex die , ad matrem suam nos transmisit , ubi adunabatur curia solennis . Et cum 
 Tentorium venissemus illuc , tam extensum erat tentorium magnum , regium . alba purpura praeparatum , eratque tam grande nostro 
 judicio , quod plusquam duo millia hominum poterant esse sub illo . Et in circuitu factum erat ligneum tabulatum variis imaginibus depictum . Illuc ergo perreximus cum 124 
 Tartaris , nobis ad custodiam assignatis , ibique convenerant omnes duces , & unusquisque cum hominibus suis Comitia . equitabat in circuitu per planiciem & colles . In prima die vestiti sunt omnes purpuris albis , in secunda vero rubeis . Et tunc venit Cuyne ad tentorium illud . Porro tertia die fuerunt omnes in blaueis purpuris , & quartam in optimis Baldakinis . In illo autem tabulato juxta tentorium erant duae majores portae , per quarum unam solus Imperator debebat intrare , & ad illam nulla erat custodia , quamvis esset aperta , quia per illam nullus audebat ingredi vel exire : per aliam omnes , qui admittebantur , intrabant , & ad illam custodes cum gladiis & arcubus & sagittis erant . Itaque si quis tentorio propinquabat ultra terminos , qui positi erant , si capiebatur , verberabatur , si fugiebat , sagitta sive ferro sagittabatur . Multique ibi erant , qui in fraenis , pectoralibus , sellis & hujusmodi , judicio nostro , auri circiter viginti marcas habebant . Sic Duces infra tentorium colloquebantur , & de Imperatoris election tractabant , ut a nobis creditur . Alius autem universus populus long extra tabulatum collocabatur , & ita fere usque ad meridiem morabantur . Tunc incipiebant lac jumentinum bibere , & usque ad vesperas tantum bibebant , quod erat visu mirabile . Nos autem vocaverunt interius , Symposium & dederunt nobis cerevisiam : quia jumentinum lac non P^rum-bibebamus . Et hoc quidem nobis pro magno fecerunt honore : sed tamen nos compellebant ad bibendum , quod nullatenus poteramus propter consuetudinem sustinere . Unde ostendimus eis , hoc esse nobis grave , ideoque nos cessaverunt compellere . Foris autem erat Dux Jeroslaus Jeroslaus Dux de Susdal Russiae , pluresque Duces Kythaorum & Solan-gorum . Duo quoque hin regis Georgiae , nuncius etiam ^ertarum Caliphi de Baldach , qui erat Soldanus , & plus quam decem nationum . alii Soldani Sarracenorum , ut credimus . Et sicut nobis a procuratoribus dicebatur , erant ibi nunciorum plus quam quatuor millia , inter illos , qui tributa portabant , & illos , qui deferebant munera , & Soldanos ac Duces alios , qui ad tradendum seipsos veniebant , & illos , pro quibus ipsi miserant , illosque , qui terrarum praefecti erant . Him omnes 
 125 
 simul extra tabulatum ponebantur , eisque simul bibere praebebatur . Nobis autem & Duci Jerozlao fere semper ab eis dabatur superior locus , quando cum eis eramus exterius .

Propter hoc autem id maxim credebatur , quia semper , quando Cuyne tentorio exibat , eidem cantabatur , & cum virgis speciosis , in summitate lanam coccineam habentibus , inclinabatur , quod alteri Ducum nulli fiebat , quousque exterius morabatur . Hasc autem statio sive Curia nomi-tyra orda . natur ab eis Syra orda . Hinc exeuntes , unanimiter omnes equitavimus per tres aut quatuor leucas ad alium locum , ubi erat in quadam pulchra planicie juxta rivum inter Aurea orda . montes aliud tentorium , quod apud ipsos appellatur Orda aurea , praeparatum . Ibi enim Cuyne debebat poni in sede in die Assumptionis Dominae nostrae . Said propter grandinem nimiam , quae tunc , ut supra dictum est , cecidit , Augusti 15. res dilata fuit . Eratque tentorium in columnis positum , quae laminis aureis erant tectae , & clavis aureis cum aliis lignis fixae . Porro de Baldakino erat tectum superius , sed alii erant panni exterius . Fuimus autem ibi usque ad festum Beati Bartholomaei , in quo maxima multitudo Preces convenit , & contra meridiem versis vultibus stetit . Et soknnes . quidam ad jactum lapidis long a caeteris erant , semperque orationes faciendo , ac genua flectendo , contra meridiem longius , & longius procedebant . Nos autem utrum incantationes facerent , aut genua Deo vel alteri flecterent , nescientes , nolebamus facere genu flexiones . Cumque diu ita fecissent , ad tentorium reversion sunt , & Cuyne in sede imperiali posuerunt , Ducesque coram eo genua flexerunt . Post hoc idem fecit universus populus , exceptis nobis , qui eis subditi non eramus .

 De astate ac moribus ac sigillo ipsius . Cap. 28. 
 Hic autem Imperator quando sublimatus est in regnum , videbatur esse circiter xl . vel xlv . annorum . Mediocris erat staturae , prudens valde , nimis astutus multumque seriosus , & gravis in moribus . Nec unquam videbat eum homo de facili ridere , vel aliquam levitatem facere , sicut dicebant Christiani , qui cum ipso morabantur continue . Dicebant etiam nobis asserendo firmiter Christiani , qui erant de familia ejus , qudd deberet fieri Christianus . Cujus signum erat , quod ipse Clericos Christianos tenebat , & expensas eis dabat . Habebat etiam semper capellam Christianorum ante majus tentorium suum , ubi cantant Clerici publice & aperte , ac pulsant ad horas , ut caeteri Christiani secundum mores Graecorum , quantacunque sit ibi multitudo Tartarorum , vel etiam aliorum hominum . Hoc tamen non faciunt alii Duces ipsorum . Est autem mos Imperatoris ipsius , ut nunquam over proprio loquatur cum extraneo , quantumcunque magnus sit , sed audit & respondet per interpositam personam , & quandocunque negotium proponunt , vel Imperatoris responsionem audiunt illi , qui sub eo sunt , quantumcunque sint magni , flexis genibus usque ad finem verborum persistunt . Nec alicui de consuetudine super aliquo negotio loqui licitum est , postquam ab Imperatore definitum est . Habet autem Imperator praedictus procuratorem & protonotarios , atque scriptores , omnesque officiales in negotiis tam publicis quam privatis , exceptis Advocatis . Nam sine litium vel judiciorum strepitu secundum arbitrium Imperatoris omnia fiunt . Alii quoque Principes Tartarorum de his , quae ad illos pertinent , idem faciunt . Hoc autem noverint universi , quia nobis tunc existentibus in solenni curia , jam ex pluribus annis indicta , idem Cuyne Imperator , de novo electus , cum omnibus suis Principibus erexit vexillum contra Ecclesiam Dei , ac Romanum Imperium , & contra omnia regna Christianorum & populos Occidentis , nisi fortasse , quod absit , facerent ea , quae mandabat Domino Papae , atque potentibus , & omnibus Christianorum popu -

 lis , videlicet ut ipsi subdantur eis . Nam excepta Christianitate , nulla est terra in orbe , quam timeant , & idcirco contra nos ad pugnam se praeparant . Hujus siquidem Imperatoris pater , scilicet Occoday , necatus fuerat veneno , & ob hoc a bellis quieverant tempore pauco . Intentio autem eorum , ut dictum est supra , est , sibi totum subjicere mundum , sicut a Chingischam habent mandatum . Unde & ipse Imperator in literis suis ita scribit : Dei fortitudo , omnium hominum Imperator . In superscriptione quoque sigilli ejus est hoc : Deus in ccelo , & Cuyne Cham super terram , Dei fortitudo : omnium hominum Imperatoris sigillum .

 De admission Fratrum & nunciorum ad Imperatorem . Cap. 29. 
 IN loco illo , ubi positus est Imperator in throno , vocati fuimus coram ipso . Cumque Chingay protonotarius ejus nomina nostra scripsisset , iliorumque a quibus missi eramus , & Ducis Solangorum & aliorum , clamavit alta voce , recitans illa coram Imperatore ac Ducum universitate . Quo facto , flexit unusquisque nostrum quater genu sinistrum , & monuerunt , ne tangeremus limen deorsum . Cumque pro cultellis nos diligentissime scrutati fuissent , & nullatenus invenissent , intravimus ostium ab Orientali parte : quia nullus ab Occident , nisi solus imperator , audet intrare . Similiter & Dux ab illa parte ingreditur solus , si est tentorium ejus . Minores autem non multum curant de talibus . Tunc ergo primum in ejus praesentia suam intravimus stationem , videlicet postquam factus est Imperator ibidem . Omnes quoque nuncii tunc ab eo recepti sunt , 128 
 sed paucissimi tentorium ejus intraverunt . Ibi vero tanta Munera donaria ab ipsis nunciis fuerunt ei praesentata , qudd quasi eidem videbantur infinita , videlicet in samitis ac purpureis & baldakinis ac cingulis sericis cum auro praeparatis , pellibus etiam nobilibus , caeterisque muneribus . Quoddam etiam Solinum , sive tentoriolum , quod super caput Imperatoris portatur , fuit eidem praesentatum , quod totum erat cum gemmis praeparatum . Quidam vero praefectus unius provinciae adduxit ei Camelos multos cum Baldakinis tectos . 
 Similiter sellae positae cum instrumentis quibusdam erant , in quibus homines interius sedere valebant . Equos etiam multos & mulos adducebant eidem phaleratos & armatos , quosdam quidem de corio , & quosdam de ferro . Nos etiam requisiti fuimus , and ei munera dare vellemus : sed jam facultas non erat , quoniam omnia fere nostra consumpseramus . Ibidem long a stationibus super montem erant Currus positi currus plusquam quingenti , qui omnes auro & argento ac sericis vestibus erant pleni . Cunctique inter imperatorem & Duces divisi fuerunt , singulique Duces inter homines suos parts suas , ut eis placuit , diviserunt . 
 De loco divisionis Imperatoris & matris suae , & morte Jeroslai , Ducis Russiae . 
 INde recedentes , venimus ad alium locum , ubi tentorium Tentorium mirabile , totum de purpura rufa , quod Kitay dederant , purpureum . 
 erat positum . Illic interius introducti fuimus , & semper cdm intrabamus nobis dabatur ad bibendum cerevisia vel vinum , & etiam carnes coctae , si volebamus , ad edendum . 
 Eratque solariolum unum , de tabulis alte praeparatum , ubi Sollum ebur-thronus Imperatoris erat positus , ex ebore mirabiliter num-sculptus , in quo etiam erat aurum , & lapides preciosi , si bene meminimus , & illuc ascendebatur per gradus . Eratque rotundum superius . Banci vero erant positi in cir - cuitu sedis , ubi dominae sedebant a part sinistra in scamnis , a dextris autem nemo sedebat superius , sed Duces sedebant in Bancis inferius , & hoc in medio . Alii vero sedebant post eos , & quolibet die veniebat dominarum maxima multitudo . Ista vero tria tentoria , de quibus supra dixi -

 mus , erant valde magna , aliaque habebant uxores ejus de filtro albo satis magna & pulchra . Ibidem Imperator divisus est a matre sua , quae ivit in unam terrae partem , & Imperator in aliam ad judicia facienda . Capta siquidem erat amica Imperatoris istius , quae veneno interfecerat patrem ejus , eo tempore , quo exercitus eorum in Hungaria fuit . Propter quod etiam exercitus eorum , qui erat in partibus illis , recessit . De qua cum aliis pluribus factum fuit judicium , & occisi fuerunt . Eodem tempore mortuus fuit Jerozlaus . Dux magnus Soldal , quae est quaedam Russiae pars . Vocatus enim ad matrem Imperatoris quasi pro honore , ut manducaret ac biberet de manu ipsius , in continenti ad hospitium est reversus , infirmatusque mortuus est post septem dies , totumque corpus ejus miro modo glaucum effectum est , dicebaturque ab omnibus , ? [ uod ibidem , ut terram ejus libere ac plenary possiderent , iiisset impotionatus . 
 Qualiter tandem Fratres ad Imperatorem accedentes , literas dederunt & acceperunt . Cap. 31 - 
 DEnique Tartari nostri nos ad Imperatorem duxerunt : qui cum audisset per illos , nos ad eum venisse , jussit nos ad matrem redire . Volebat enim secundo die , sicut superius dictum est , contra totam Occidentis terram vexillum erigere , quod nos volebat ignorare . Itaque reversion stetimus paucis diebus , & iterum ad ipsum reversion sumus . Cum quo bene per mensem fuimus in tanta fame ac siti , quod vix vivere poteramus . Nam expensae , quae nobis pro diebus quatuor dabantur , vix uni sufficiebant . Nec invenire poteramus aliquid ad emendum , quia forum erat nimis remotum . Said Dominus nobis quendam Ruthenum , nomine Cosmam , aurifabrum praeparavit , qui satis dilectus Imperatori , nos in aliquo sustentavit . Et hic nobis ostendit thronum Imperatoris , quem ipse fecerat , antequam poneretur in sede , & sigillum ejusdem , quod etiam fabricaverat ipse . Post hoc Imperator pro nobis misit , nobisque per Chingay protonotarium suum dici fecit , ut verba nostra 
 13° 
 & negotia scriberemus , eique porrigeremus . Quod & fecimus . Post plures dies nos iterum vocari fecit , & utrum essent apud Dominum Papam , qui Ruthenorum vel Sarracenorum , aut etiam Tartarorum literam intelligerent , interrogavit . Cui respondimus , qudd nullam istarum literarum habebamus . Sarraceni tamen erant in terra , sed remoti erant a Domino Papa . Diximus tamen , quia nobis expedire videbatur , qudd in Tartar ico scriberent , & nobis interpretarentur , nos autem in litera nostra diligenter scriberemus , & tam literam quam interpretationem ad Dominum Papam deferremus . Tunc a nobis recesserunt , & ad Imperatorem iverunt . Porro a die Beati Martini fuimus vocati . Tunc Kadac , totius imperii procurator , & Chingay & Bala , pluresque scriptores ad nos venerunt , nobisque literam de verbo ad verbum interpretati fuerunt . Et cum in Latina litera scripsissemus , faciebant sibi per singulas orationes interpretari , volentes scire , si nos in aliquo verbo erraremus . Cum igitur ambae literae fuissent scriptae , fecerunt nos semel ac secundo legere , ne forte minus aliquid haberemus . Dixerunt enim nobis , videte , qudd omnia bene intelligatis , quia non expediret , qudd non omnia bene intelligeretis . Literas etiam in Sarracenico scripserunt , ut aliquis in partibus nostris inveniri posset , qui eas , si opus esset , legeret . 
 Qualiter licentiati fuerunt . Cap. 32. 
 UT autem nobis Tartari nostri dixerunt , proposuit Imperator nuncios suos nobiscum mittere . Volebat tamen , ut credimus , quod nos id ab eo peteremus . Said cum unus de Tartaris nostris , qui senior erat , nos ad hoc petendum hortaretur , nobis quidem , ut venirent , ne quaquam bonum videbatur . Ideoque respondimus ei , qudd non erat nostrum petere , sed si sponte ipse Imperator mitteret eos , libenter eos secure conduceremus , Domino adjuvante . Nobis autem ob plures causas ut venirent , non videbatur expedire . Prima quidem fuit , quia timuimus , ne visis dissentionibus aut guerris , quae fiunt inter nos , magis animarentur ad veniendum contra nos . Secunda

 fuit , timebamus eos exploratores terrae fieri . Tertia vero , quia timebamus eos interfici . Gentes enim nostrae arrogantes sunt & superbae . Unde quando servientes , qui stant nobiscum , ex rogatu Cardinalis , legati scilicet Ale-manniae , in habitu Tartarico ibant ad ipsum , in via ferb lapidati sunt a Teutonicis , & coacti sunt deponere habitum illum . Consuetudo autem est Tartarorum , ut cum illis , qui nuncios eorum occiderint , nunquam faciant pacem , nisi sumant de ipsis ultionem . Quarta etiam causa fuit , quia timebamus ne nobis auferrentur vi . Quinta verb causa erat , quia de adventu eorum nulla foret utilitas , ciim nullum haberent aliud mandatum vel potestatem , nisi qu6d literas Imperatoris ad Dominum Papam & ad Principes deferrent , quas videlicet literas ipsi nos habebamus , & malum ex eorum adventu posse contingere credebamus . Itaque tertia die post hoc , scilicet in festo beati Briccii nobis dederunt licentiam & literam , Imperatoris sigillo munitam , mittentes nos ad ipsius Imperatoris matrem , quas unicuique nostrum dedit pelliceum unum de pellibus vulpinis , quod habebat pilos de foris , & purpuram unam . De quibus Tartari nostri furati sunt ex unaquaque unum passum . De illa quoque , quae dabatur servienti , meliorem medietatem sunt furati . Quod nos quidem non ignoravimus , sed inde verba movere noluimus . 
 Qualiter ab illo itinere redierunt . Cap. 33. 
 TUnc iter ad revertendum arripuimus , ac per totam hyemem venimus , jacentes in deserts saepius in nive , nisi quantum poteramus nobis cum pede locum facere . Ibi quip non erant arbores , sed planus campus . Et saepe manb nos inveniebamus totos nive , quam ventus pellebat , coopertos . Sic venientes usque ad Ascensionem Domini pervenimus ad Bathy . A quo ciim inquireremus , quid responderet Domino Papae , dixit se nolle aliud , nisi quod Imperator diligenter scripserat , demandare .

 Bout this time also , Pope Innocentius the fourth sent Frier Ascelline being one of the order of the Predicants , together with three other Friars ( of the same authority whereunto they were called ) consorted with him out of diverse Covens of their order , with letters Apostolical unto the Tar 
 tars camp : wherein he exhorted them to give over their bloody slaughter of mankind , and to receive the Christian faith . And I , in very deed , received the relations concerning the deeds of the Tartars only , ( which , according to the congruence of times , I have above inserted into this my work ) from a Friar Minorite , called Simon de Sanct. Quintin , who lately returned from the same voyage . And at that very time also , there was a certain other Friar Minorite , namely Friar John de Plano Carpini , sent with certain associates unto the Tartars , who likewise ( as himself witnesseth ) abided and conversed with them a year and three months at the least . For both he & one Friar Benedict a Polonian being of the same order , and a partaker of all his misery and tribulation , received straight commandment from the Pope , that both of them should diligently search out all things that concerned the state of the Tartars . And therefore this Friar John hath written a little Historic ( which is come to our hands ) of such things , as with his own eyes he saw among the Tartars , or which he herd from diverse Christians worthy of credit , remaining there in captivity . Out of which historic I

 thought good by way of conclusion , to insert somewhat for the supply of those things which are wanting in the said Friar Simon . 
 Of the situation and quality of the Tartars land , By Johannes de Plano Carpini . Chap. 3. 
 THere is towards the East a land which is called Mongal or Tartaria , lying in that part of the world which is thought to be most North Easterly . On the East part it hath the country of Kythay and of the people called Solangi : on the South part the country of the Saracens : on the South east the land of the Huini : and on the West the province of Naimani : but on the North side it is environed with the Ocean Sea. In some part thereof it is full of mountains , and in other places plain and smooth ground , but every where sandy and barren , neither is the hundreth part thereof fruitful . For it cannot bear fruit unless it be moistened with river waters , which be very rare in that country . Whereupon they have neither villages , nor cities among them , except one which is called Cracurim , and is said to be a proper town . We our selves saw not this town , but were almost within half a days journey thereof , when we remained at Syra Orda , which is the great court of their Emperor . And albeit the foresaid land is otherwise unfruitful , yet is it very commodious for the bringing up of cattle . In certain places thereof are some small store of trees growing , but otherwise it is altogether destitute of woods . Therefore the Emperor , and his noble men and all other warm themselves , and dress their meat with fires made of the dung of oxen , and horses . The air also in that country is very intemperate . For in the midst of Summer there be great thunders and lightnings , by the which many men are slain , and at the same time there falls great abundance of snow . There be also such mighty tempests of cold winds , that sometime men are not able to sit on horseback . Whereupon , being

 Their tabernacles . 
 habitations of their Emperors and noble men ) in regard of the great wind we were constrained to lie groveling on the earth , and could not see by reason of the dust . There is never any rain in Winter , but only in Summer , albeit in so little quantity , that sometime it scarcely suffices to allay the dust , or to moisten the roots of the grass . There is often times great store of hail also . Insomuch that when the Emperor elect was to be placed in his Imperial throne ( my self being then present ) there fell such abundance of hail , that , upon the sudden melting thereof , more then 160. persons were drowned in the same place : there were many tents and other things also carried away . Likewise , in the Summer season there is on the sudden extreme heat , and suddenly again intolerable cold . 
 Of their form , habit , and manner of living . Chap. 4. 
 THe Mongals or Tartars , in outward shape , are unlike to all other people . For they are broader between the eyes , and the balls of their cheeks , then men of other nations be . They have flat and small noses , little eyes , and eye lids standing straight upright , they are shaved on the crowns like priests . They wear their hair somewhat longer about their ears , then upon their foreheads : but behind they let it grow long like woman's hair , whereof they braid two locks binding eke of them behind either ear . They have short feet also . The garments , as well of their men , as of their women are all of one fashion . They use neither cloaks , hats , nor caps . But they wear Jackets framed after a strange manner , of buckram , scarlet , or Baldakines . Their shoubes or gowns are hairy on the outside , and open behind , with tails hanging down to their hammes . They use not to wash their garments , neither will in any wise suffer them to be washed , especially in the time of thunder . Their habitations be round and cunningly made with wickers and staves in manner of 136 
 a tent . But in the midst of the tops thereof , they have a window open to convey the light in and the smoke out . For their fire is always in the midst . Their walls be covered with felt . Their doors are made of felt also . Some of these Tabernacles may quickly be taken asunder , and set together again , and are carried upon beasts backs . Other some cannot be taken insunder , but are stowed upon carts . And whithersoever they go , be it either to war , or to any other place , they transport their tabernacles with them . They are very rich in cattle , as in camels , oxen , sheep , and Their cattle . goats . And I think they have more horses and mares then all the world beside . But they have no kine nor other beasts . Their Emperor's , Dukes , & other of their nobles do abound with silk , gold , silver , and precious stones . Their victuals are all things that may be eaten : Their for we saw some of them eat lice . They drink milk in victuals . great quantity , but especially mares milk , if they have 55-1 it : They sees Mill also in water , making it so thin , that they may drink thereof . Every one of them drinks off a cup full or two in a morning , and sometime they eat nought else all the day long . But in the evening each man hath a litde flesh given him to eat , and they drink the broth thereof . Howbeit in summer time , when they have mares milk enough , they seidome eat flesh , unless perhaps it be given them , or they take some beast or bird in hunting . 
 Of their manners both good and bad . Chap. 5. 
 THeir manners are partly praiseworthy , and partly Their detestable : For they are more obedient unto their obedience . 
 lords and master's , then any other either clergy or laie-people in the whole world . For they do highly reverence them , and will deceive them , neither in words nor deeds . They seidome or never fallen out among themselves , and , as for fightings or brawlings , wounds or manslaughters , they never happen among them . There Their are neither thieves nor robbers of great riches to be d ” ttr > ence .

 Their insolency against strangers . 
 found , and therefore the tabernacles and carts of them that have any treasures are not strengthened with locks or bars . If any beast go astray , the finder thereof either lets it go , or drives it to them that are put in office for the same purpose , at whose hands the owner of the said beast demandeth it , and without any difficulty receives it again . One of them honoureth another exceedingly , and bestoweth banquets very familiarly and liberally , notwithstanding that good victuals are dainty and scarce among them . They are also very hardy , and when they have fasted a day or two without any manner of sustenance , they sing and are merry as if they had eaten their bellies full . In riding , they endure much cold and extreme heat . There be , in a manner , no contentions among them , and although they use commonly to be drunken , yet do they not quarrel in their drunkenness . Noe one of them despises another but helpeth and furthereth him , as much as conveniently he can . Their women are chaste , neither is there so much as a word uttered concerning their dishonesty . Some of them will notwithstanding speak filthy and immodest words . But towards other people , the said Tartars be most insolent , and they scorn and set nought by all other noble and ignoble persons whatsoever . For we saw in the Emperors court the great duke of Russia , the kings son of Georgia , and many great Sultans receiving no due honour and estimation among them . So that even the very Tartars assigned to give attendance unto them , were they never so base , would always go before them , and take the upper hand of them , yea , and sometime would constrain them to fit behind their backs . Moreover they are angry and of a disdainful nature unto other people , and beyond all measure deceitful , and treacherous towards them . They speak fair in the beginning , but in conclusion , they sting like scorpions . For crafty they are , and full of falsehood , circumventing all men whom they are able , by their sleights . Whatsoever mischief they intend to practise against a man , they 
 138 
 keep it wonderfully secret , so that he may by no means provide for himself , nor find a remedy against their conspiracies . They are unmannerly also and uncleanly in taking their meat and their drink , and in other actions . Drunkenness is honourable among them , and when any of them hath taken more drink then his stomach can well bear , he casts it up and falls to drinking again . They are most intolerable exacters , most covetous possessors , and most niggardly givers . The slaughter of other people is accounted a matter of nothing with them . 
 Of their laws and customs . Chap. 6. 
 MOreover , they have this law or custom , that Punishments whatsoever man or woman be manifestly taken °f adultery . 
 in adultery , they are punished with death . A virgin likewise that hath committed fornication , they slay together with her mate . Whosoever be taken in of theft . robbery or theft , is put to death without all pi tie . Also , of secrets if any man disclose their secrets , especially in time of disclosed . war , he receives and hundreth blows on the back with a bastinado , laid on by a tall fellow . In like sort when any inferiors offend in ought , they find no favour at their superiors hands , but are punished with grievous stripes . 
 They are joined in matrimony to all in general , yea , Laws of even to their near kinsfolks except their mother , matrimome-daughter and sister by the mother's side . For they use to marry their sister by the father's side only , and also the wife of their father after his decease . The younger brother also , or some other of his kindred , is bound to marry the wife of his elder brother deceased . For , at the time of our abode in the country , a certain duke of Andreas duke Russia nam Andreas , was accused before duke Baty for °f^ussia-conveying the Tartars horses out of the land , and for selling them to others : and although it could not be proved , yet was he put to death . His younger brother and the wife of the party deceased hearing this , came & made their supplication unto the forenamed duke , that 
 139 
 the dukedom of Russia might not be taken from them . But he commanded the youth to marry his deceased brother's wife , and the woman also to take him unto her husband , according to the custom of the Tartars . She answered , that she had rather die , then so haynously transgress the law . Howbeit , he delivered her unto him , although they both refused as much as they could . Wherefore carrying them to bed , they constrained the youth , lamenting and weeping , to lie down and commit incest with his brother's wife . To be short , after the death of their husbands , the Tartars wives use very seidome to marry the second time , unless perhaps some man takes his brother's wife or his stepmother in marriage . They make no difference between the son of their wife and of their concubine , but the father gives what he pleases unto each one : For of late the king of Georgia having two sons , one lawfully begotten called Melich ; but the other David , born in adultery , at his death left part of his land unto his base son . Hereupon Melich ( unto whom the kingdom fell by right of his mother , because it was governed before time by women ) went unto the Emperor of the Tartars , David also having taken his journey unto him . Now both of them coming to the court and proffering large gifts , the son of the harlot made suit , that he might have justice , according to the custom of the Tartars . Well , sentence passed against Melich , that David being his elder brother , should have superiority over him , and should quietly and peaceably possess the portion of land granted unto him by his father . Whensoever a Tartar hath many wives , each one of them hath her family and dwelling place by her self . And sometime the Tartar eateth , drinketh and lies with one , and sometime with another . One is accounted chief among the rest , with whom he is oftener conversant , then with the other . And notwithstanding ( as it hath been said ) they are many , yet do they seidome fall out among themselves . 
 140 
 Of their superstitious traditions . Chap. 7. 
 BUt by reason of certain traditions , which either they or their predecessors have devised , they account some things indifferent to be faults . One is to thrust a knife into the fire , or any way to touch the fire with a knife , or with their knife to take flesh out of the cauldron , or to hew with and hatchet near unto the fire . For they think by that means to take away the head or force from the fire . Another is to lean upon the whip , wherewith they beat their horses : for they ride not with spurs . Also , to touch arrows with a whip , to take or kill young birds , to strike and horse with you rain of their bridle , and to break one bone against another . Also , to pour out milk , meat , or any kind of drink upon the ground or to make water within their tabernacle : which whosoever does willingly , he is slain , but otherwise he must pay a great sum of money to the enchanter to be purified . Who likewise must cause the tabernacle with all things therein , to pass between two fierce . Before it be on this wise purified , no man dare once enter into it , nor convey any thing thereout . Beside , if any man hath a morsel given him , which he is not able to swallow , and for that cause casts it out of his mouth , there is and hold made under his tabernacle , by which he is drawn forth and slain without all compassion . Likewise , whosoever treads upon the threshold of any of their dukes tabernacles , he is put to death . Many other things there be , like unto these , which they take for heinous offences . But to slay men , to invade the dominions of other people , and to rifle their goods , to transgress the commandments and prohibitions of God , are with them no offences at all . They know nothing concerning eternal life , and everlasting damnation , and yet they think , that after death they shall live in another world , that they shall multiply their cattle , that they shall eat and drink and doe other things which living men perform here upon earth . At a new moon , or a full moon , they begin all enterprises

 the said fires , binding a cord to the tops of the Javelins . And about the cord they tie certain jagges of buckram , under which cord , and between which fires , men , beasts , and tabernacles do pass . There stand two women also , one on the right side , and another on the left casting water , and repeating certain charms . If any man be slain by lightning , all that dwell in the same tabernacle with him must pass by fire in manner aforesaid . For their tabernacles , beds , and carts , their felts and garments , and whatsoever such things they have , are touched by no man , yea , and are abandoned by all men as things unclean . And to be short , they think that all things are to be purged by fire . Therefore , when any ambassadors , princes , or other personages whatsoever come unto them , they and their gifts must pass between two fires to be purified , lest peradventure they have practised some witchcraft , or have brought some poison or other mischief with them .

 The people of Tartaria . 
 The original y the exploits of Chingis . 
 Of the beginning of their empire or government . Chap. 8. 
 THe East country , whereof we have entreated , which is called Mongal , is reported to have had of old time foure sorts of people . One of their companions was called Yeka Mongal , that is the great Mongals . The second company was called Sumongal , that is , the Water-Mongals , who called themselves Tartars of a certain river running through their country nam Tartar . The third was called Merkat , and the fourth Metrit . All these people had one and the same person , attire of body and language , albeit they were divided by princes and provinces . In the province of Yeka Mongal , there was a certain man called Chingis . This man 
 142 
 became a mighty hunter . For he learned to steal men , & to take them for a prey . He ranged into other countries taking as many captives as he could , and joining them unto himself . Also he allured the men of his own country unto him , who followed him as their captain and ringleader to do mischief . Then began he to make war upon the Sumongals or Tartars , and slew their captain , and after many conflicts , subdued them unto himself , and brought them all into bondage . Afterwards he used their help to fight against the Merkats , dwelling by the Tartars , whom also he vanquished in battle . Proceeding from thence , he fought against the Metrites , and conquered them also . The TheNaimani . Naimani hearing that Chingis was thus exalted , greatly disdained thereat . For they had a mighty & puissant Emperor , unto whom all the foresaid nations paid tribute . Whose sons , when he was dead , succeeded him in his Empire . Howbeit , being young and foolish , 
 they knew not how to govern the people , but were The discord of divided , and fell at variance among themselves . Now brothers . Chingis being exalted , as is aforesaid , they nevertheless invaded the forenamed countries , put the inhabitants to the sword , and carried away their goods for a prey . Which Chingis having intelligence of , gathered all his subject's together . The Naimani also , and the people called Karakitay assembled and banded themselves at a certain straight valley , where , after a battle foughten they were vanquished by the Mongals . And being thus vanquished , they were , the greater part of them , slain ; and others , which could not escape , were carried into captivi tie . In the land of the foresaid Karakytayans , Occoday Cham , the son of Chingis Cham , after he was Occoday created Emperor , built a certain city , which he called Cham-Chanyl . Near unto which city , on the South side , there is and huge desert , wherein wild men are certainly reported to inhabit , which cannot speak at all , and are destitute of joints in their legs , so that if they fallen , they cannot rise alone by themselves . Howbeit , they are of 
 143 
 discretion to make felts of Camels hair , wherewith they cloth themselves , and which they hold against the wind . And if at any time , the Tartars pursuing them , chance to wound them with their arrows , they put herbs into their wounds , and fly strongly before them . 
 Of the mutual victories between them , and the people of Kythay . Chap. 9. 
 Hay than & TO ) Ut the Mongals returning home into their own Paulus jj country , prepared themselves to battle against the VthemUS Cal1 * Kythayans : Which their Emperor hearing , set forward * Cathayans . against them with his army , and they fought a cruel battle , wherein the Mongals were overcome , and all their nobles in the army , except seven , were slain . And for this cause , when they , purposing to invade any region , are threatened by the inhabitants thereof to be slain , they do , to this day , answer : in old time also our whole number beside being slain , we remained but seven of us alive , and yet notwithstanding we are now grown unto a great multitude , think not therefore to daunt us with such brags . But Chingis and the residue that remained alive , fled home into their country : And having breathed 
 New victories , him a little , he prepared himself to war , and went forth against the people called Huyri : These men were Chris - 
 Letters . tians of the sect of Nestorius . And these also the Mongals overcame , and received letters or learning from them : for before that time they had not the art of writing , and now they call it the hand or letters of the Mongals . Immediately after , he marched against the country of Saruyur , and of the Karanites , and against the land of Hudirat ; all which he vanquished . Then returned he home into his own country , and breathed himself . Afterwards , assembling his warlike troops , they marched with one accord against the Kythayans , and waging war with them a long time , they conquered a great part of their land , and shut up their Emperor into his greatest city : which city they had so long time besieged , that they began to want necessary provision for their 
 144 
 army . And when they had no victuals to feed upon , Chingis Cham commanded his soldiers , that they should eat every tenth man of the company . But they of the city fought manfully against them , with engines , darts , and arrows , and when stones wanted they threw silver , and especially melted silver : for the same city abounded with great riches . Also , when the Mongals had fought a long time and could not prevail by war , they made a great trench underneath the ground from the army unto the midst of the city , and there issuing forth they fought against the citizens , and the remnant also without the walls fought in like manner . At last , breaking open the gates of the city , they entered , and putting the Emperor , with many other to the sword , they took possession thereof and conveyed away the gold , silver , and all the riches therein . And having appointed certain deputies over the country , they returned home into their own land . This is the first time , when the Emperor of the Kythayans being vanquished , Chingis Cham obtained the Empire . But some part of the country , because it lies within the sea , they could by no means conquer unto this day . The men of Kytay are Pagans , having a speciali kind of writing by themselves , and ( as it is reported ) the Scriptures of the old and new Testament . They have also recorded in histories the lives of their forefathers : and they have Eremites , and certain houses made after the rftanner of our Churches , which in those days they greatly resorted unto . They say that they have diverse Saints also , and they worship one God . They adore and reverence CHRIST JESUS our Lord , and believe the article of eternal life , but are not baptised . They do also honourably esteem and reverence our Scriptures . They love Christians , and bestow much alms , and are a very courteous and gentle people . They have no beards , and they agree partly with the Mongals in the disposition of their countenance . In all occupations which men practise , there are not better artificers in the whole world .

 The stratagem of the king of India . 
 Of their war against India major and minor . Chap. 10. 
 A Nd when the Mongals with their emperor Chingis Cham had a while rested themselves after the foresaid victory , they divided their armies . For the Emperor sent one of his sons nam Thossut ( whom also they called Can , that is to say , Emperor ) with and army against the people of Comania , whom he vanquished with much war , and afterwards returned into his own country . But he sent his other son with and army against the Indians , who also subdued India minor . These Indians are the black Saracens , which are also called / Ethiopians . But here the army marched forward to fight against Christians dwelling in India major . Which the King of that country hearing ( who is commonly called Presbyter John ) gathered his soldiers together , and came forth against them . And making men's images of copper , he set each of them upon a saddle on horseback , and put fire within them , and placed a man with a pair of bellows on the horse back behind every image . And so with many horses and images in such sort furnished , they marched on to fight against the Mongals or Tartars . And coming near unto the place of the battle , they first of all sent those horses in order one after another . But the men that sat behind laid I wot not what upon the fire within the images , and blew strongly with their bellows . Whereupon it came to pass , that the men and the horses were burned with wild fire , and the air was darkened with smoke . Then the Indians cast darts upon the Tartars , of whom many were wounded and slave . And so they expelled them out of their dominions with great confusion , neither did we hear , that ever they returned thither again .

 How being repelled by monstrous men shapen like dogs , they overcame the people of Burithabeth . Chap. 11. 
 BUt returning through the deserts , they came into a certain country , wherein ( as it was reported unto us in the Emperors court , by certain clergy men of Russia , and others , who were long time among them , and that by strange strong and steadfast affirmation ) they found certain report of cer-monsters resembling women : who being asked by many wmen a „ worser interpreters , where the men of that land were , they dogs . answered , that whatsoever women were born there , were endued with the shape of mankind , but the males were like unto dogs . And delaying the time , in that country they met with the said dogs on the other side of the river . And in the midst of sharp winter , they cast themselves into the water : Afterwards they wallowed in the dust upon the main land , and so the dust being mingled with water , was frozen to their backs , and having often times so done , the ice being strongly frozen upon them , with great fury they came to fight against the Tartars . And when the Tartars threw their darts , or shot their arrows among them , they rebounded back again , as if they had lighted upon stones . And the rest of their weapons could by no means hurt them . Howbeit , the Dogs made and assault upon the Tartars , and wounding some of them with their teeth , and slaying others , at length they drave them out of their countries . And thereupon they have a Proverb of the same matter , as yet rife among them , which they speak in jesting sort one to another ; My father or my brother was slain of Dogs . The women which they took , they brought into their own country , who remained there till their dying day . And in traveling homewards , the said army of the Mongals came unto Theregion of the land of Burithabeth ( the inhabitants whereof are Burtthabeth-Pagans ) and conquered the people in battle . These people have a strange or rather a miserable kind of 
 custom . For when any men father deceaseth , he The manners assembleth all his kindred , and they eat him . These of the people . men have no beards at all , for we saw them carry a certain iron instrument in their hands , wherewith , if any hairs grow upon their chin , they presently pluck them out . They are also very deformed . From thence the Tartars army returned to their own home . 
 Another expedition of Chinas . 
 How they had the repulse at the Caspian mountains , and were driven back by men dwelling in caves . Chap. 12. 
 MOreover Chingis Cham , at the same time when he sent other armies against the East , he himself marched with a power into the land of Kergis , which notwithstanding , he conquered not in that expedition , and as it was reported unto us , he went on forward even to the Caspian mountains . But the mountains on that part where they encamped themselves , were of adamant , and therefore they drew unto them their arrows , and weapons of iron . And certain men contained within those Caspian mountains , hearing , as it was thought , the noise of the army , made a breach through , so that when the Tartars returned unto the same place tenne years after , they found the mountain broken . And attempting to go unto them , they could not : for there stood a cloud before them , beyond which they were not able to pass , being deprived of their sighed so soon as they approached thereunto . But they on the contrary side thinking that the Tartars durst not come nigh them , gave the assault , & when they came at the cloud , they could not proceed for the cause aforesaid . Also the Tartars , before they came unto the said mountains , passed for the space of a month and more , through a vast wilderness , & departing thence towards the East , they were above a month traveling through another huge desert . At length , they came unto a land wherein they saw beaten ways , but could not find any people . Howbeit , at the last , diligently seeking , they found a man & his wife , whom they presented before 
 148 
 Chingis Cham : and demanding of them where the people of that country were , they answered , that the people inhabited under the ground in mountains . Then Chingis Cham keeping still the woman , sent her husband unto them , giving them charge to come at his command . And going unto them , he declared all things that Chingis Cham had commanded them . But they answered , that they would upon such a day visit him , to satisfy his desire . And in the mean season , by blind & hidden passages under the earth , assembling themselves , they came against the Tartars in warlike manner , and suddenly issuing forth , they slew a great number of them . This people were not able to endure the terrible noise , which in that place the Sun made at his uprising : for at the time of the Sun rising , they were enforced to lay one ear upon the ground , and to stop the other close , lest they should hear that dreadful found . Neither could they so escape , for by this means many of them were destroyed . Chingis Cham therefore and his company , seeing that they prevailed not , but continually lost some of their number , fled and departed out of that land . But the man and his wife aforesaid they carried along with them , who all their life time continued in the Tartars country . Being demanded why the men of their country do inhabit under the ground , they said , that at a certain time of the year , when the sun riseth , there is such and huge noise , that the people cannot endure it . Moreover , they use to play upon cymbals , drums , and other musical instruments , to the end they may not hear that sound .

 Then by chance they found you fresh entrails of a beast : which they took , & casting away the dung thereof , caused it to be sodden , brought it before Chingis Cham , & did The tawe eat thereof . And hereupon Chingis Cham enacted ; that Chingis . 
 149 
 neither the blood , nor the entrails , nor any other part of a beast which might be eaten , should be cast away , save only the dung . Wherefore he returned thence into his own land , and there he ordained laws and statutes , which the Tartars do most strictly and inviolably observe , The death of of the which we have before spoken . He was afterwards Chingis . slain by a thunderclap . He had foure sons : the first ts sons . called Occoday , the second Thossut Can , the third 
 Thiaday : the name of the fourth is unknown . From these foure descended all the dukes of the Mongals . The His grand - first son of Occoday is Cuyne , who is now Emperor : children . h ; s brother's be Cocten and Chyrinen . The sons of 
 Thossut Can are Bathy , Ordu , Siba , and Bora. Bathy , next unto the Emperor , is richer and mightier then all the rest . But Ordu is the seignior of all the dukes . The sons of Thiaday be Hurin and Cadan . The sons of Chingis Cham his other son , whose name is unknown , are Mengu , Bithat , and certain others . The mother of Mengu was nam Seroctan , and of all others most honoured among the Tartars , except the Emperor's mother , and mightier then any subject except Bathy . The Tar - These be the names of the dukes : Ordu , who was in 
 tarian dukes . Poland and in Hungarie : Bathy also & Hurin & Cadan , and Siban , and Ovygat , all which were in Hungarie . In like manner Cyrpodan , who is as yet beyond the sea , making war against certain Sultans of the Saracens , and other inhabitants of far countries . Others remained in the land , as namely Mengu , Chyrinen , Hubilai , Sinocur , Cara , Gay , Sybedey , Bora , Berea , Corrensa . There be many other of their dukes , whose names are unknown unto us . 
 Of the authority of the Emperor , and of his dukes . Chap. 14. 
 The absolute r “ 
 and lordly A that Oreo ver , the Emperor of the Tartars hath a 
 ‘ Tartarian^ dominion over all his subject's . For no 
 Emperor over man are abide in any place , unless he hath assigned him his subject's . to be there . Also he himself appoints to his dukes 
 150 
 where they should inhabit . Likewise the dukes assign places unto every Millenary , or conducter of a thousand soldiers , the Millenaries unto each captain of and too . the captains unto every corporali of ten . Whatsoever is given them in charge , whensoever , or wheresoever , be it to fight or to loose their lives , or howsoever it be , they obey without any gainsaying . For if he demandeth any men daughter , or sister being a virgin , they presently deliver her unto him without all contradiction : yea , often times he makes a collection of virgins throughout all the Tartars dominions , and those whom he means to keep , he retaineth unto himself , others he bestoweth upon his men . Also , whatsoever messenger he sends , or whithersoever , his subject's must without delay find them horses and other necessaries . In like sort , from what country soever tribute payers , or ambassadors come unto him , they must have horses , carriages , and expenses allowed them . Notwithstanding ambassadors coming from other places do suffer great misery , and are in much want both of victuals , and of apparel : especially when they come to any of the dukes , and there they are constrained to make some lingering abided . Then ten men Their are allowed so little sustenance , that scarcely two could barbarous live thereof . Likewise , if any injuries be ottered them , towar^s they cannot without danger make complaint . Many gifts ambassadors . also are demanded of them , both by dukes and others , which if they do not bestow , they are basely esteemed , and set at nought . And hereupon , we were of necessity inforced to bestow in gifts a great part of those things which were given us by well disposed people , to defray our charges . To be short , all things are so in the power and possession of the Emperor , that no man dare say , This is mine , or , this is my neighbours ; but all , both goods , cattle and men are his own . Concerning this matter also he published a statute of late . The very same authority and jurisdiction , do the dukes in like sort exercise upon their subject's .

 Of the election of Emperor Occoday , and of the expedition of duke Bathy . Chap. 15. 
 AFter the death of Chingis Cham aforesaid , the dukes assembled themselves and chosen Occoday his son to be their Emperor . And he , entering into consultation with his nobles , divided his armies , and sent duke Bathy his nephew against the country of Altisoldan , and against the people called Bisermini , who were Saracens , but spoke the language of Comania . The Tartars invading their country , fought with them and subdued them in battle . But a certain city called Barchin resisted them a long time . For the citizens had cast up many ditches and trenches about their city , in regard whereof the Tartars could not take it , till they had filled the said ditches . But the citizens of Sarguit hearing this , came forth to meet them , yielding themselves unto them of their own accord . Whereupon their city was not destroyed , but they slew many of them and others they carried away captive , and taking spoils , they filled the city with other inhabitants , and so marched forth against the city of Orna . This town was very populous and exceeding rich . For there were many Christians therein , as namely Gasarians , Russians , and Alanians , with others , and Saracens also . The government of the city was in the Saracens hand . It stands upon a mighty river , and is a kind of port town , having a great mart exercised therein . And when the Tartars could not otherwise overcome it , they turned the said river , running through the city , out of his channel , and so drowned the city with the inhabitants and their goods . Which being done , they set forward against Russia , and made foul havoc there , destroying cities and castles and murdering the people . They laid siege a long while unto Kiow the chief city of Russia , and at length they took it and slew the citizens . Whereupon , traveling through that country , we found and innumerable multitude of dead men's skulls and bones lying upon the earth . For it was 
 a very large and a populous city , but it is now in a manner brought to nothing : for there do scarce remain 200. houses , the inhabitants whereof are kept in extreme bondage . Moreover , out of Russia and Comania , they proceeded forward against the Hungarians , and the Polonians , and there many of them were slain , as is aforesaid : and had the Hungarians manfully withstood them , the Tartars had been confounded and driven back . Returning from thence , they invaded the country of the Morduans being pagans , and conquered The them in battle . Then they marched against the people Morduans-called Byleri , or Bulgaria magna , & utterly wasted the Bulgaria country . From hence they proceeded towards the mag ™ - North against the people called Bastarci or Hungaria Hungaria magna , and conquered them also . And so going on mag ™ - further North , they came unto the Parossitae , who having Parossita - . little stomachs and small mouths , eat not any thing at all , but seething flesh they stand or sit over the pot , and receiving the steam or smoke thereof , are therewith only nourished , and if they eat any thing it is very little . From hence they came to the Samogetae , who live Samogeta : . only upon hunting , and use to dwell in tabernacles only , and to wear garments made of beasts skins . From thence they proceeded unto a country lying upon the Ocean sea , where they found certain monsters , who in The North all things resembled the shape of men , saving that their ocean-feete were like the feet of and ox , and they had in deed men's heads but dogs faces . They spoke , as it were , Northern two words like men , but at the third they barked like monsters . dogs . From hence they retired into Comania , and there some of them remain unto this day . 
 Of the expedition of duke Cyrpodan . Chap. 16. 
 AT the same time Occoday Can sent duke Cyrpodan Kergls . 
 with and army against Kergis , who also subdued them in battle . These men are Pagans , having no beards at all . They have a custom when any of their father's die , for grief and in token of lamentation to 
 153 
 draw as it were , a leather thong overthwart their faces , from one ear to the other . This nation being conquered , duke Cyrpodan marched with his forces Southward against the Armenians . And travailing through certain desert places , they found monsters in the shape of men , which had each of them but one arm & one hand growing out of the midst of their breast , and but one foot . Two of them used to shoot in one bow , and they ran so swiftly , that horses could not overtake them . They ran also upon that one foot by hopping and leaping , and being weary of such walking , they went upon their hand and their foot , turning themselves round , as it were in a circle . And being weary of so doing , they ran again according to their wonted manner . Isidore Cyclopedes . calls them Cyclopedes . And as it was told us in court , by the clergy men of Russia , who remain with the foresaid Emperor , many ambassadors were sent from them unto the Emperors court , to obtain peace . From thence they proceeded forth into Armenia , which they Armenia 13 conquered in battle , and part also of Georgia . And the Georgia other part is under their jurisdiction , paying as yet every 
 conquer . year unto them for tribute , 20000. pieces of coin called 
 Yperpera . From thence they marched into the dominions of the puissant and mighty Soldan called Deurum , whom also they vanquished in fight . And to be short , they went on farther sacking and conquering , even unto thee The Soldan of Soldan of Aleppo his dominions , and now they have subdued that land also , determining to invade other countries ’ beyond it : neither returned they afterwards into their own land unto this day . Likewise the same army The Caliph of marched forward against the Caliph of Baldach his Baldach . country , which they subdued also , & exacted at his hands the daily tribute of 400. Byzantines , beside Baldakines and other gifts . Also every year they send messengers unto the Caliph moving him to come unto them . Who sending back great gifts together with his tribute beseecheth them to be favourable unto him . Howbeit the Tartarian Emperor receives all his gifts , 
 * 54 
 & yet still nevertheless sends for him , to have him come . 
 How the Tartars behave themselves in war . Chap. 17. 
 / ^•Hingis Cham divided his Tartars by captains of The military ten , captains of and 100. and captains of a 1000. discipline of 
 And over ten Millenaries or captains of a 1000 , he tfie artars‘ placed , as it were , one Colonel , and yet notwithstanding over one whole army he authorised two or three dukes , but yet so that all should have especial regard unto one of the said dukes . And when they join battle against any other nation , unless they do all with one consent give back , every man that flies is put to death . And if one or two , or more of ten proceed manfully to the battle , but the residue of those ten draw back & follow not the company , they are in like manner slain . Also , if one among ten or more be taken , their fellows , if they rescue them not , are punished with death . Moreover they are enjoined to have these weapons following . Two long bows or one Their good one at the least , three quivers full of arrows , & one weapons . axe , and ropes to draw engines withal . But the richer sort have single edged swords , with sharp points , and somewhat crooked . They have also armed horses with their shoulders and breasts defenced , they have helmets and brigandines . Some of them have jacks , and caparisons for their horses made of leather artificially doubled or trebled upon their bodies . The upper part of their helmet is of iron or steel , but that part which com-passeth about the neck and the throat is of leather . Howbeit some of them have all their foresaid furniture of iron framed in manner following . They beat out many thin plataeae a finger broad , and a handful long , and making in every one of them eight little holes , they put thereunto three strong and straight leather thongs . So they join the plataeae one to another , as it were , ascending by degrees . Then they tie the plataeae 
 155 
 Their experience & cunning in warns . 
 Their manner of passing over rivers . 
 unto the said thongs , with other small and slender thongs , drawn through the holes aforesaid , and in the upper part , on each side thereof , they fasten one small doubled thong unto another , that the plataeae may firmly be knit together . These they make , as well for their horses caparisons , as for the armour of their men : And they skowre them so bright that a man may behold his face in them . Some of them upon the neck of their lance have and hook , wherewithal ! they attempt to pull men out of their saddles . The heads of their arrows are exceedingly sharp cutting both ways like a two edged sword , and they always carry a file in their quivers to whet their arrowheads . They have targets made of wickers , or of small rods . Howbeit they do not ( as we suppose ) accustom to carry them , but only about the tents , or in the Emperors or dukes guards , & that only in the night season . They are most politic in wars , having be exercised therein with other nations for the space of these 42. years . When they come at any rivers , the chief men of the company have a round and light piece of leather , about the borders whereof making many loops , they put a rope into them to draw it together like a purse , and so bring it into the round form of a ball , which leather they fill with their garments and other necessaries , trussing it up most strongly . But upon the midst of the upper part thereof , they lay their saddles and other hard things , there also do the men themselves fit . This their boat they tie unto and horse tail , causing a man to swim before , & to guide over the horse , or sometime they have two oars to row themselves over . The first horse therefore being driven into the water , all the other horses of the company follow him , and so they pass through the river . But the poorer sort of common soldiers have every man his leather bag or satchel well sown together , wherein he packs up all his trinkets , and strongly trussing it up hangs it at his horses tail , and so passes over , in manner aforesaid .

 How they may be resisted . Chap. 18. 
 IDeeme not any one kingdom or province able to resist them : because they use to take up soldiers out of every country of their dominions . And if so be the neighbour province which they invade , will not aid them , utterly wasting it , with the inhabitants thereof , whom they take from thence with them , they proceed on to fight against another country . And placing their captives in the forefront of the battle , if they fight not courageously , they put them to the sword . Wherefore , if Christians would withstand them , it is expedient , that the provinces and governors of countries should agree in one , and so by common counsel , should give them resistance . Their soldiers also must be furnished with strong hand-bowes & crossbows , which they greatly dread , & with sufficient arrows , with maces also of good iron , or and axe with a long handle or staff . When they make their arrow heads , they must ( according to you Tartars custom ) dip them redhot into water mingled with salt , that they may be strong to pierce the enemies armour . They that will may have swords also & lances with hooks at the ends , to pull them from their saddles , out of which they are easily removed . They must have helmets likewise & other armour to defend themselves & their horses from 
 Counsel how to wage war against the Tartars . 
 A notable temper of iron or steel . 
 the Tartars weapons & arrows , & they that are unarmed , must ( according to you Tartars custom ) march behind their fellows , and discharge at the enemy with long bows and crossbows . And ( as it is above said of the Tartars ) they must orderly dispose their bands and troops , and ordain laws for their soldiers . Whosoever runneth to the prey or spoil , before the victory be achieved , must undergo a most severe punishment . For such a fellow is put to death among the Tartars without all pity or mercy . The place of battle must be chosen , if it be possible , in a plain field , where they may see round about , neither must 
 * 57 
 all be in one company , but in many and several bands , not very far distant one from another . They which give the first encounter must send one band before , and must have another in a readiness to relieve and second the former in time convenient . They must have spies also on every side to give them notice when the rest of the enemies bands approach . For therefore ought they always to send forth band against band & troop against troop , because the Tartar ever practiseth to get his enemy in the midst and so to environ him . Let our bans take this caveat also , if the enemy retire , not to make any long pursuit after him , lest peradventure ( according to his custom ) he might draw them into some secret ambush : for the Tartar fights more by policy then by main force . And again , lest our horses be tired : for we are not so well stored with horses as they . Those horses which the Tartars use one day , they ride not upon three or foure days after . Moreover , if the Tartars draw homeward , our men must not therefore depart and casseir their bands , or separate themselves asunder : because they do this upon policy , namely to have our army divided , that they may more securely invade and waste the country . And in very deed , our captains ought both day and night to keep their army in a readiness : and not to lie out of their armour , but at all assays , to be provided for battle . For the Tartars like devils are always watching and devising how to practise mischief . Furthermore , if in battle any of the Tartars be cast ofF their horse backs , they must presently be laid hold on and taken , for being on foot they shoot strongly , wounding and killing both horses and men . 
 * Johannes de Of the journey of friar * John unto the first 
 plano Carpini guard of the Tartars < Chap 
 WE therefore by the commandment of the sea apostolic setting forth towards the nations of the East , chosen first to travel unto the Tartars , because 158 
 we feared that there might be great danger imminent The journey of upon the Church of God next unto them , by their frfr invasions . Proceeding on therefore , we came to the Legate° ™ king of Bohemia , who being of our familiar acquaintance , advised us to take our journey through Polonia and Russia . For we had kinsfolks in Polonia , by whose assistance , we might enter into Russia . Having given us his letters , he caused our charges also to be defrayed , in all his chief houses and cities , till we 
 came unto his nephew Boleslaus duke of Slesia , who Boleslaus duke also was familiar and well known unto us . The like favour he showed us also , till we came unto Conradus duke of * Lautiscia , unto whom then ( by Gods especial * Mazovla . favour towards us ) lord Wasilico duke of Russia was come , from whose mouth we herd more at large concerning the deeds of the Tartars : for he had sent ambassadors thither , who were returned back unto him . 
 Wherefore , it being given us to understand , that we must bestow gifts upon them , we caused certain skins of bevers and other beasts to be bought with part of that money , which was given upon alms to succour us by the way . Which thing duke Conradus and the * duchess Grlmslaua . of Cracow , and a bishop , and certain soldiers being advertised of , gave us likewise more of the same skins . And to be short , duke Wasilico being earnestly requested by the duke of Cracow , and by the bishop and barons , on our behalf , conducted us with him , unto his own land , and there for certain days , entertained us at his own charges , to the end that we might refresh our selves a while . And when , being requested by us , he had caused his bishops to resort unto him , we read before them the Popes letters , admonishing them to return unto the unity of the Church . 
 To the same purpose also , we our selves admonished them , and to our ability , induced as well the duke as the bishops and others thereunto . Howbeit because duke Daniel the Daniel brother of Wasilico aforesaid ( having as then taken his brother unto journey unto Baty ) was absent , they could not at that time , ast tc° ' make a final answer . After these things duke Wasilico 
 159 
 sent us forward with one of his servants as far as Kiow the chief city of Russia . Howbeit we went always in The danger of our lives by reason of the Lituanians , who did Lithuanians . often invade you borders of Russia , even in those very places by which we were to pass . But in regard of the foresaid servant , we were out of the Russians danger , the greatest part of whom were either slain , or carried into captivity by the Tartars . Moreover , at Danilon we were feeble even unto the death . ( Notwithstanding we caused our selves to be carried in a wagon through the snow and extreme cold . ) And being come unto Kiow , we consulted with the Millenary , 8c other noble men there concerning our journey . They told us , that if we carried those horses , which we then had , unto the Tartars , great store of snow lying upon the ground , they would all die : be cause they knew not how to dig up the grass under The fodder of the snow , as the Tartarian horses do , neither could there the Tartarian bee ought found for them to eat , the Tartars having neither horses . hay nor straw , nor any other fodder . We determined therefore to leave them behind at Kiow with two servants appointed to keep them . And we were constrained to bestow gifts upon the Millenary , that we might obtain his favour to allow us post horses and a guide . Wherefore beginning our journey the second day after the feast of the Purification , we arrived at the town of Canow , which was immediately under the dominion of the Tartars . The governor whereof allowed us horses and a guide unto Mich^as the another town , wherein we found one Michaeas to be ma iduus . governor , a man full of all malice and despite . Who 
 notwithstanding , having received gifts at our hands , according to his manner conducted us to the first guard of the Tartars . 
 How he and his company were at the first received of the Tartars . Chap. 20. 
 WHerefore , the first Saturday next after Ash Wednesday , having about the Suns going down , taken up our place of rest , the armed Tartars came rushing upon 160 
 us in uncivil and horrible manner , being very inquisitive of us what manner of persons , or of what condition we were : & when we had answered them that we were the Popes Legates , receiving some victuals at our hands , they immediately departed . Moreover in the morning rising and proceeding on our journey , the chief of them which were in the guard met with us , demanding why , or for what intent and purpose we came thither ? and what business we had with them ? Unto whom we answered , We are the legates of our lord the Pope , who is the father & lord of the Christians . He hath sent us as well unto your The contents . Emperor , as to your princes , and all other Tartars for °fthe this purpose , because it is his pleasure , that all Christians should be in league with the Tartars , and should have peace with them . It is his desire also that they should become great or in favour with God in heaven , therefore he admo-nisheth them aswell by us , as by his own letters , to become Christians , and to embrace the faith of our Lord Jesu Christ , because they could not otherwise be saved . Moreover , he gives them to understand , that he much mar-veileth at their monstrous slaughters & massacres of mankind , & especially of Christians , but most of all of Hungarians , Mountaineirs , 8c Polonians , being all his subject's , having not injuried them in ought , nor attempted to do them injury . And because the Lord God is grievously offended thereat , he adviseth them from henceforth to beware of such dealing , & to repent them of that which they had done . He requesteth also , that they would write and answer unto him , what they purpose to do hereafter , and what their intention is . All which things being herd and understood , the Tartars said that they would appoint us post horses and a guide unto Corrensa . And immedi - Corrensa . ately demanding gifts at our hands , they obtained them . 
 Then receiving the same horses , from which they dismounted , together with a guide we took our journey unto Corrensa . But they riding a swift pace , sent a * messenger before unto the said duke Corrensa , to signify the message , which we had delivered unto them . This marches .

 How they were received at the court of Corrensa . Chap. 21. 
 BEing come therefore unto his court , he caused our tent to be placed far from him , and sent his agents to demand of us with what we would incline unto him , that is to say , what gifts we would offer , in doing our obeisance unto him . Unto whom we answered , that our lord the Pope had not sent any gifts at all , because he was not certain that we should ever be able to come at them : for we passed through most dangerous places . Notwithstanding , to our ability , we will honour him with some part of those things , which have be , by the goodness of God , & the favour of the Pope , bestowed upon us for our sustenance . Having received our gifts , they conducted us unto the Orda or tent of the duke , & we were instructed to bow thrice with our left knee before the door of the tent , and in any case to beware , lest we set our foot upon the threshold of the said door . And that after we were entered , we should rehearse before the duke and all his nobles , the same words , which we had before said , kneeling upon our knees . Then presented we the letters of our lord the Pope : but our interpreter whom we had hired and brought with us from Kiow was not sufficiently able to interpret them , neither was there any other esteemed to be meet for the same purpose . Here certain post horses and three Tartars were appointed for us to conduct us from hence with all speed unto duke Bathy . This Bathy is the mightiest prince among them except the Emperor , & they are bound to obey him before all other princes . We began our journey towards his court the first tuesday in Lent , and riding as fast as our horses could trot ( for we had fresh horses almost thrice or foure times a day ) we posted from morning till night , yea very often in 
 162 
 the night season also , and yet could we not come at him before Maundie thursday . All this journey we went through the land of Comania , which is all plain ground , and hath foure mighty rivers running through it : The first is called J Neper , on the side whereof towards Russia , duke Corrensa & Montii marched up and down , which

The fourth is called J laec , upon which two Millenaries do march , on each side of the river one . All these , in the winter time , descend down to the sea , & in summer ascend back by the banks of the said rivers up to the mountains .

 MOreover , when we came unto Bathy in the land of Comania , we were seated a good league distant from his tabernacles . And when we should be conducted unto his court , it was told us that we must pass between two fires . But we would by no means be induced thereunto . Howbeit , they said unto us : you may pass through without all danger : for we would have you to do it for 163

 none other cause , but only that if you intend any mischief against our lord , or bring any poison with you , fire may take away all evil . Unto whom we answered , that to the end we might clear ourselves from all suspicion of any such matter , we were contented to pass through . When therefore we were come unto the Orda , being demanded 
 Eyed gay . by his agent Eldegay with what present or gift we would 
 do our obeisance ? we gave the sameanswere which we did at the court of Corrensa . The gifts being given and received , the causes of our journey also being herd , they brought us into the tabernacle of the prince , first bowing our selves at the door , & being admonished , as before , 
 Bathy hears not to tread upon the threshold . And being entered , we the Legates . Spoke unto him kneeling upon our knees , & delivered him our letters , and requested him to have interpreters to translate them . Who accordingly on good friday were sent unto us , and we together with them , diligently translated our said letters into the Russian , Tartarian , and Saracen languages . This interpretation was presented unto Bathy , which he read , & attentively noted . At length we were conducted home again unto our own lodging , howbeit no victuals were given unto us , except it were once a little Millet in a dich , the first night of our 
 He behaves coming . This Bathy caries himself very stately & himself hke magnificently , having porters and all officers after the a , ns ' manner of the Emperor , and sits in a lofty seat or throne together with one of his wives . The rest , namely , as well his brothers and sons , as other great personages fit underneath him in the midst upon a bench , and others fit down upon the ground , behind him , but the men on the right hand and the women on the left . He hath very fair and large tents of linen cloth also , which were once the kings of Hungaria . Neither dare any man come into his tent ( beside them of his own family ) unless he be called , be he never so mighty and great , except perhaps it be known that it is his pleasure . we also , for the same cause , sat on the left hand ; for so do all ambassadors in going : but in returning from the Emperor , we were 
 164 
 always placed on the right hand . In the midst stands his table , near unto the door of the tent , upon the which there is drink filled in golden and silver vessels . Neither does Bathy at any time drink , nor any other of the Tartarian princes , especially being in a public place , but they have singing and minstrilsie before them . And always , when he rides , there is a canopy or small tent carried over his head upon the point of a javelin . And so do all the great princes of the Tartars , & their wives also . The said Bathy is courteous enough unto his own men , and yet is he had in great awe by them : he is most cruel in fight : he is exceedingly prudent and politic in war , because he hath now continued a long time in martial affairs .

But being come as far as duke Montii aforesaid , there they were kept until our return . Upon Easter day , having said our prayers , and taken a slender breakfast , in the company of two Tartars , which were assigned unto us by Corensa we departed with many tears , not knowing whither we went to death or to life .

The land of Comania on the North side immediately after Russia , hath the people called Morduyni Byleri , that is , Bulgaria magna , the Bastarci , that is , Hungaria magna , next unto the Bastarci , the Parositae and the Samogetae . Next unto the Samogetae are those people which are said to have dogs faces , inhabiting upon the desert shores of the Ocean . On the South side it hath the Alani , the Circassi , the Gazari , Greece and Constantinople ; also the land of Iberia , the Cathes , the Brutaches who are said to be Jewes shaving their heads all over , the lands also of Scythia , of Georgia , of Armenia , of Turkey . On the West side it hath Hungaria , and Russia . Also Comania is a most large and long country . The inhabitants whereof called Comani the Tartars slew , some notwithstanding fled from them , and the rest were subdued under their bondage . But most of them that fled are returned again . Afterwards we entered the land of the Kangittae , which in many places hath great scarcety of waters , wherein there are but few inhabitants by reason of the foresaid defect of water . For this cause diverse of the servants of Jeroslaus duke of Russia , as they were traveling towards him into the land of Tartaria , died for thirst , in that desert . As before in Comania , so likewise in this country , we found many skulls and bones of dead men lying upon the earth like a dunghill . Through this country we were traveling from the eight day after Easter until Ascension day . The inhabitants thereof were Pagans , and neither they nor the Comanians used to till the ground , but lived only upon cattle , neither built they any houses but dwelled in tents . These men also have the Tartars rooted out , and do possess and inhabit their country , howbeit , those that remained are reduced into their bondage .

 MOreover , out of the land of the Kangittas , we entered Thelandofthe into the country of you Bisermini , who speak the Bisermini . 
 language of Comania , but observe the law of the Saracens . In this country we found innumerable cities with castles ruined , & many towns left desolate . The lord of this country was called Soldan Alti , who with all his progeny , Alti Soldanus . was destroyed by the Tartars . This country hath most huge mountains . On the South side it hath Jerusalem Huge moun-and Baldach , and all the whole country of the Saracens . tamesIn the next territories adjoining doe inhabit two carnail brother's dukes of the Tartars , namely , Burin and Cadan , Burin and the sons of Thyaday , who was the son of Chingis Cadan-Can . On the North side thereof it hath the land of the 
 black Kythayans , and the Ocean . In the same country Syban the brother of Bathy remains . Through this country we were traveling from the feast of Ascension , until eight days before the feast of S. John Baptist . And then we entered into the land of the black Kythayans , in which the Emperor built and house , where we were called in to drink . Also the Emperors deputy in that place caused the chief men of the city and his two sons to

 dance before us . Departing from hence , we found a certain small sea , upon the shore whereof stands a little A small sea . mountain . In which mountain is reported to be a hold , from whence , in winter time such vehement tempests of winds do issue , that travellers can scarcely , and with great danger pass by the same way . In summer time , the noise in deed of the wind is herd there , but it pro-ceedeth gently out of the hold . Along the shores of the foresaid sea we travailed for the space of many days , which Many days . although it be not very great , yet hath it many islands , and we passed by leaving it on our left hand . In this 
 land dwells Ordu , whom we said to be ancient Orducap . 13. unto all the Tartarian dukes . And it is the Orda or 
 court of his father which he inhabiteth , and one of his 167

 wives bears rule there . For it is a custom among the Tartars , that the Courts of Princes or of noble men are not dissolved , but always some women are appointed to keep and govern them , upon whom certain gifts are bestowed , in like sort as they are given unto their Lords . And so at length we arrived at the first court of the Emperor , wherein one of his wives dwelled . 
 How they came unto Cuyne himself , who was forthwith to be chosen Emperor . Chap. 25 - 
 BUt because we had not as yet seen the Emperor , they would not invite us nor admit us into his Orda , but caused good attendance and entertainment , after the Tartars fashion , to be given unto us in our own tent , and they caused us to stay there , and to refresh our selves with them one day . Departing thence upon the even of Saint Peter and Saint Paul , we entered into the land of the Naymani , who are Pagans . But upon the very feast day of the said Apostles , there fell a mighty snow in that place , and we had extreme cold weather . This land is full of mountains , and cold beyond measure , and there is little plain ground to be seen . These two nations last mentioned used not to till their ground , but , like unto the Tartars , dwelled in tents , which the said Tartars had destroyed . Through this country we were travailing many days . Then entered we into the land of the Mongals , whom we call Tartars . Through the Tartars land we continued our travail ( as we suppose ) for the space of some three weeks , riding always hastily and with speed , and upon the day of Marie Magdalene we arrived at the court of Cuyne the Emperor elect . But therefore did we make great haste all this way , because our Tartarian guides were straightly commanded to bring us unto the court Imperiali with all speed , which court hath been these many years , ordained for the election of the Emperor . Wherefore rising early , we travailed until night without eating of any thing , and oftentimes we 
 168 
 came so late unto our lodging , that we had no time to eat the same night , but that which we should have eaten over night , was given us in the morning . And often changing our horses , we spared no Horseflesh , but road swiftly and without intermission , as fast as our horses could trot . 
 How Cuyne entertained the Minorite Friars . Chap. 26. 
 BUt when we were come unto the court of Cuyne , he caused ( after the Tartars manner ) a Tent and all expenses necessary to be provided for us . And his people entreated us with more regard and courtesy , then they did any other Ambassadors . Howbeit we were not called before his presence , because he was not as yet elected , nor admitted unto his empire . Notwithstanding , the interpretation of the Popes letters , and the message which we delivered , were sent unto him by the foresaid Bathy . And having stayed there five or sixe days , he sent us unto his mother , under whom there was maintained a very solemn and royal court . And being come thither , we saw and huge tent of fine white cloth pitched , which was , to our judgement , of so great quanti tie , that more then two thousand men might stand within it , and round about it there was a wall of planks set up , painted with diverse images . we therefore with our Tartars assigned to attend upon us , took our journey thither , and there were all the Dukes assembled , eke one of them riding up and down with his train over the hills and dales . The first day they were all clad in white , but the second in scarlet robes . Then came Cuyne unto the said tent . Moreover , the third day they were all in blue robes , and the fourth in most rich robes of Baldakin cloth . In the wall of boards , about the tent aforesaid , were two great gates , by one of the which gates , the Emperor only was to enter , and at that gate there was no guard of men appointed to stand , although it stood continually open , because none durst go in or come out the same way : all that were admitted , entered by another gate , 169

 at which there stood watchmen , with bows , swords , & arrows . And whosoever approached unto the tent beyond the bounds and limit assigned , being caught , was beaten , but if he fled , he was shot at with arrows or iron . There were many that to our judgement , had upon their bridles , trappers , saddles , and such like furniture , to the valve of 20. marks in pure gold . The foresaid Dukes ( as we think ) communed together within the tent , and consulted about the election of their Emperor . But all the residue of the people were placed far away without the walls of board , & in this manner they stayed almost till noon . The banquet of Then began they to drink mares milk , & so continued the Nobles . drinking till even tide , and that in so great quantity , as it 
 was wonderful . And they called us in unto them , and gave us of their ale , because we could not drink their mares milk . And this they did unto us in token of great honour . But they compelled us to drink so much , that in regard of our customary diet , we could by no means endure it . Whereupon , giving them to under - stand , that it was hurtful unto us , they ceased to compel JenslausDuke us any more . Without the door stood Duke Jeroslaus ofSusdal . of Susdal , in Russia , and a great many Dukes of the 
 Kythayans , and of the Solangi . The two sons also of the king of Georgia , the ligier of the Caliph of Baldach , who was a Soldan , and ( as we think ) above ten Sultans Ambassadors of the Saracens beside . And , as it was told us by the of sundry na - agents , there were more then 4000. ambassadors , partly tims ' of such as paid tributes , and such as presented gifts , and other Sultans , and Dukes , which came to yield themselves , and such as the Tartars had sent for , and such as were governors of lands . All these were placed without the lists , and had drink given unto them . But almost continually they all of them gave us and Duke Jeroslaus the upper hand , when we were abroad in their company .

 How he was exalted to his Empire . Chap. 27. 
 A Nd to our remembrance , we remained there , about 
 the space of foure weeks . The election was to our Thebegynnings thinking there celebrated , but it was not published and °f Cuyne his proclaimed there . And it was greatly suspected so to be , because always when Cuyne came forth out of the tent , he had a noise of music , and was bowed unto , or honoured with fair wands , having purple wool upon the tops of them , and that , so long as he remained abroad : which service was performed to none of the other Dukes . 
 The foresaid tent or court is called by them Syra Orda . Sir a Orda . Departing thence , we all with one accord road 3. or 4. leagues unto another place , where , in a goodly plain , by a rivers side , between certain mountains , there was another tent erected , which was called the golden Orda . For ‘ The golden there was Cuyne to be placed in the throne Imperial , Crda . upon the day of the Assumption of our Lady . But , for T5-the abundance of hail which fell at the same time , as is above said , the matter was deferred . There was also a tent erected upon pillars , which were covered with plataeae of gold , and were joined unto other timber with golden nails . It was covered above with Baldakin cloth , but does . there was other cloth spread over that , next unto the air . we abided there unto the feast of Saint Bartholomew , what time there was assembled and huge multitude standing with their faces towards the South . And a certain number of them being a stones cast distant from the residue , making continual prayers , and kneeling upon their knees , proceeded farther and farther towards the South . Howbeit we , not knowing whither they used enchantments , or whither they bowed their knees to God or to some other , would not kneel upon the ground with them . And having done so a long time , they returned to the tent , and placed Cuyne in his throne imperiali , and his Dukes bowed their knees before him . Afterward the whole multitude kneeled down in like manner , except our selves , for we were none of his subject's . 
 171 
 A lawless authentic . 
 Of his age and demeanour , and of his seal . Chap. 28. 
 THis Emperor , when he was exalted unto his government , seemed to be about the age of fourty or fourty five years , He was of a mean stature , very wise and politic , and passing serious and grave in all his demeanour . A rare thing it was , for a man to see him laugh or behave himself lightly , as those Christians report , which abided continually with him . Certain Christians of his family earnestly and strongly affirmed unto us , that he himself was about to become a Christian . A token and argument whereof was , that he retained diverse Clergy men of the Christians . He had likewise at all times a Chapel of Christians , near unto his great Tent , where the Clerks ( like unto other Christians , and according to the custom of the Grecians ) do sing publicly and openly , and ring bells at certain hours , be there never so great a multitude of Tartars , or of other people in presence . And yet none of their Dukes do the like . It is the manner of the Emperor never to talk his own self with a stranger , though he be never so great , but hears and answereth by a speaker . And when any of his subject's ( how great soever they be ) are in propounding any matter of importance unto him , or in hearing his answer , they continue kneeling upon their knees unto the end of their conference . Neither is it lawful for any man to speak of any affairs , after they have been determined of by the Emperor . The said Emperor , hath in his affairs both public and private , and Agent , and Secretary of estate , with Scribes and all other Officials , except advocates . For , without the noise of pleading , or sentence giving , all things are done according to the Emperors will and pleasure . Other Tartarian princes do the like in those things which belong unto them . But , be it known unto all men , that whilst we remained at the said Emperor's court , which hath been ordained and kept for these many years , the 172 
 said Cuyne being Emperor new elect , together with all his princes , erected a flag of defiance against the Church of God , & the Roman empire , and against all Christian War ™ in - . kingdoms and nations of the West , unless peradventure ^iQ^tians ( which God forbid ) they will condescend unto those j things , which he hath enjoined unto our lord the Pope , L & to all potentates and people of the Christians , namely , that they will become obedient unto him . For , except Christendom , there is no land under heaven , which they stand in fear of , and for that cause they prepare themselves to battle against us . This Emperor's father , namely Occoday was poisoned to death , which is the cause why they have for a short space abstained from war . But their intent and purpose is ( as I have above said ) to subdue the whole world unto themselves , as they were commanded by Chingis Can . Hence it is that the Emperor in his letters writeth after this manner : The power of God , & Emperor of all men . Also , upon his seal , there is this posy engraven : God in heaven , and Cuyne Can upon earth , the power of God : the seal of the Emperor of all men . 
 Of the admission of the Friars and Ambassadors 
 unto the Emperor . Chap. 29. 
 IN the same place where the Emperor was established Cuyneheareth into his throne , we were summoned before him . And the Legates . 
 Chingay his chief secretary having written down our names , and the names of them that sent us , with the name of the Duke of Solangi , & of others , cried out with a loud voice , rehearsing the said names before the Emperor , and the assembly of his Dukes . Which being done , each one of us bowed his left knee foure times , & they gave us warning not to touch the threshold . And after they had searched us most diligently for knives , and could not find any about us , we entered in at the door upon the East side : because no man dare presume to enter at the West door , but the Emperor only . In like manner , every Tartarian Duke entereth on the West side into his tent . Howbeit the inferior sort do not 
 173 
 greatly regard such ceremonies . This therefore was the first time , when we entered into the Emperors tent in his presence , after he was created Emperor . Likewise all other ambassadors were there received by him , but very few were admitted into his tent . And there were preGifts presen - scented unto him such abundance of gifts by the said ted unto him . Ambassadors , that they seemed to be infinite , namely in 
 Samites , robes of purple , and of Baldakin cloth , silk girdles wrought with gold , and costly skins , with other gifts also . Likewise there was a certain Sun Canopy , or small tent ( which was to be carried over the Emperors head ) presented unto him , being set full of precious stones . And a governor of one Province brought unto him a company of camels covered with Baldakins . They had saddles also upon their backs , with certain other instruments , within the which were places for men to sit upon . Also they brought many horses & mules unto him furnished w‘ trappers and caparisons , some being made of leather , and some of iron . And we were demanded whither we would bestow any gifts upon him or no ? But we were not of ability so to do , having in a manner spent all our provision . There were also upon and hill standing a good distance from the tents , 500. Cartsful more then 500. carts , which were all full of silver and of of treasure . gold , and silk garments . And they were all divided be - 
 tween the Emperor and his Dukes , and every Duke bestowed upon his own followers what pleased him . 
 Of the place where the Emperor and his mother took their leaves one of another , and of Jeroslaus Duke of Russia . Chap. 30. 
 A tent of T'XEparting thence , we came unto another place , where purple . a wonderful brave tent , all of read purple , given by 
 the Kythayans , was pitched . we were admitted into that also , and always when we entered , there was given unto us ale and wine to drink , & sodden flesh ( when we would ) to eat . There was also a lofty stage built of boards , where the Emperors throne was placed , being 174 
 very curiously wrought out of ivory , wherein also there thnne of was gold and precious stones , and ( as we remember ) lvme-there were certain degrees or stairs to ascend unto it . 
 And it was round upon the top . There were benches placed about the said throne , whereon the ladies sat toward the left hand of the Emperor upon stools , ( but none sat aloft on the right hand ) and the Dukes sat upon benches below , the said throne being in the midst . Certain others sat behind the Dukes , and every day there resorted great company of Ladies thither . The three tents whereof we spoke before , were very large , but the Emperor his wives had other great and fair tents made of white felt . This was the place where the Emperor parted company with his mother : for she went into one part of the land , and the Emperor into another to execute justice . For there was taken a certain Concubine of this Emperor , which had poisoned his father to death , at the same time when the Tartars army was in Hungarie , which , for the same cause returned home . Moreover , upon the foresaid Concubine , and deatJl of many other of her confederates sentence of judgement was Gccoda^ re~ pronounced , and they were put to death . At the same 6 ' time Jeroslaus the great Duke of Soldal , which is a part Or of Russia , deceased . For being ( as it were for honours sake ) invited to eat and drink with the Emperors mother , and immediately after the banquet , returning unto his lodging , he fell sick , and within seven days , died . And after his death , his body was of a strange blue colour , and it was commonly reported , that the said Duke was poisoned , to the end that the Tartars might freely and totally possess his Dukedom .

 TO be short , the Tartars brought us unto their Emperor , who when he had herd of them , that we were come unto him , commanded that we should 175

 return , unto his mother . For he was determined the next day , ( as it is abovesaid ) to set up a flag of defiance against all you countries of the West , which he would have us in no case to know . Wherefore returning , we stayed some few days with his mother , and so returned back again unto him . With whom we continued for the space of one whole month in such extreme hunger and thirst , that we could scarce hold life and soul together . For the provision allowed us for foure days , was scantly sufficient for one day . Neither could we buy us any sustenance , because the market was too far off . Howbeit the Lord provided for us a Russian goldsmith , nam Cosmas , who being greatly in the Emperors favour , procured us some sustenance . This man showed unto us the throne of the Emperor , which he had made , before it was set in the proper place , and his seal , which he also had framed . Afterwards the Emperor sent for us , giving us to understand by Chingay his chief Secretary , that we should write down our messages & affairs , and should deliver them unto him . Which thing we performed accordingly . After many days he called for us again , demanding whither there were any with our Lord the Pope , which understood the Russian , the Sarracen , or the Tartarian language ? To whom we answered , that we had none of those letters or languages . Howbeit , that there were certain Saracens in the land , but inhabiting a great distance from our Lord the Pope . And we said , that we thought it most expedient , that when they had written their minds in the Tartarian language , and had interpreted the meaning thereof unto us , we should diligently translate it into our own tongue , and so deliver both the letter and the translation thereof unto our Lord the Pope . Then departed they from us , and went unto the Emperor . And after the day of S. Martine , we were called for again . Then Kadac principal agent for the whole empire , and Chingay , and Bala , with diverse other Scribes , came unto us , and interpreted the letter word for word . And having written 
 176 
 it in Latin , they caused us to interpret unto them eke sentence , to wit if we had erred in any word . And when both letters were written , they made us to read them over twice more , lest we should have mistaken ought . For they said unto us : Take heed that you understand all things thoroughly , for if you should not understand the whole matter aright , it might breed some inconvenience . They wrote the said letters also in the Saracen tongue , that there might be some found in our dominions which could read and interpret them , if need should require . 
 How they were licensed to depart . Chap. 32. 
 A Nd ( as our Tartars told us ) the Emperor was purposed to send his ambassadors with us . Howbeit , he was desirous ( as we thought ) that we our selves should crave that favour at his hands . And when one of our Tartars being and ancient man , exhorted us to make the said petition , we thought it not good for us , that the Emperor should send his ambassadors . Wherefore we gave him answer , that it was not for us to make any such petition , but if it pleased the Emperor of his own accord to send them , we would diligently ( by Gods assistance ) see them conducted in safety . Howbeit , we thought it expedient for us , that they should not go , and that for diverse causes . First , because we feared , lest they , seeing the dissensions and wars which are among us , should be the more encouraged to make war against us . Secondly , we feared , that they would be instead of spies and intelligencers in our dominions . Thirdly , we misdoubted that they would be slain by the way . For our nations be arrogant and proud . For when as those servants ( which at the request of the Cardinali , attended upon us , namely the legates of Almain ) returned unto him in the Tartars attire , they were almost stoned in the way , by the Dutch , and were compelled to put ofF those garments . And it is the Tartars custom , never to be reconciled unto such as have slain their Ambassadors , till they have revenged themselves . Fourthly , lest they should be taken from us

 by main force . Fiftly , because there could come no good by their ambassade , for they were to have none other commission , or authority , but only to deliver their Emperors letter unto the Pope , and to the Princes of Christendome , which very same letters we our selves had , and we knew right well , that much harm might ensue thereof . Wherefore , the third day after this , namely , upon the feast of Saint Brice , they gave us our passport and a Letter sealed with the Emperors own seal , sending us unto the Emperors mother , who gave unto eke of us a gown made of Foxe-skinnes , with the fur on the outside , and a piece of purple . And our Tartars stole a yard out of every one of them . And out of that which was given unto our servant , they stole the better half . Which false dealing of theirs , we knew well enough , but would make no words thereof . 
 How they returned homeward . Chap. 33. 
 THen taking our journey to return , we travailed all 
 Winter long , lying in the deserts oftentimes upon the snow , except with our feet we made a piece of ground bore to lie upon . For there were no trees , but the plain champion field . And oftentimes in the morning , we found our selves all covered with snow driven over us by the wind . And so travailing till the feast of our Lords Ascension , we arrived at the court of Bathy . Of whom when we had inquired , what answer he would send unto our Lord the Pope , he said that he had nothing to give us in charge , but only that we should diligently deliver that which the Emperor had written . And , having received letters for our safe conduct , the thirteenth day after Pentecost , being Saterday , we were proceeded as far as Montii , with whom our foresaid associates and servants remained , which were withheld from us , and we caused them to be delivered unto us . From hence we travailed unto Corrensa , to whom , requiring gifts the second time at our hands , we gave none , because we had not wherewithal ! . And he appointed us two 
 178 
 Comanians , which lived among the common people of the Tartars , to be our guides unto the city of Kiow in Russia . Howbeit one of our Tartars parted not from us , till we were passed the utmost guard of the Tartars . But the other guides , namely the Comanians , which were given us by Corrensa , brought us from the last guard unto the city of Kiow , in the space of sixe days . And there we arrived fifteene days before the feast of Saint John Baptist . Moreover , the Citizens of Kiow having intelligence of our approach , came forth all of them to meet us , with great joy . For they rejoiced over us , as over men that had be risen from death to life . So like wise they did unto us throughout all Russia , Polonia , and Bohemia . Daniel and his brother Wasilico made us a royal feast , and entertained us with them against our wills for the space of eight days . In the mean time , they with their Bishops , and other men of account , being in consultation together about those matters which we had propounded unto them in our journey towards the Tartars , answered us with common consent , saying : that they would hold the Pope for their speciali Lord and Father , and the Church of Rome for their Lady & mistress , confirming likewise all things which they had sent concerning this matter , before our coming , by their Abbate . And for the same purpose , they sent their Ambassadors and letters by us also , unto our Lord the Pope .
