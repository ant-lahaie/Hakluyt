De mercatoribus Angliae in Norwegia arestatis , & eorum mercimoniis de arrestandis literse Edwardi secundi anno sexto regni sui , Haquino regi Norwegian . 
 Agnifico principi domino Haquino Dei gratia regi Norwegiae illustri , amico suo charissimo Edwardus ------ eadem Dei gratia rex Angliae , Dom. Hiberniae , & dux Aquitaniae salutem cum dilectione sincera . Miramur 
 non modicum & in intimis conturbamur de gravaminibus 
 & oppressionibus quae subditis nostris infra regnum vestrum causa negociandi venientibus his diebus plus solito absque causa rationabili , sicut ex gravi querela didicimus , inferuntur . Nuper siquidem Willihelmus filius Laurentii de Waynfleete , Simon filius Alani de eadem , Guido filius Mathei & eorum socii mercatores nostri nobis conquerendo monstrarunt , quod cum ipsi quosdam homines & servientes suos cum tribus navibus suis ad parts regni vestri , ad negotiandum ibidem transmisissent : & naves illae in portu villae vestrae de Villam de Tonnesbergh halece & aliis bonis diversis usque ad Tonnesbergh . magnam summam oneratae fuissent : Et licet nautis navium praedictarum hominibusque & servientibus praedictis a regno vestro libere cum navibus & bonis praedictis ad parts Angliae redeundi vestras fieri feceritis de conductu , postmodum tamen antequam naves illae propter venti contrarietatem portum praedictum exire potuerunt , quidam ballivi vestri naves praedictas cum hominibus & bonis omnibus tunc existentibus in eisdem , occasion 
 mortis cujusdam militis nuper ballivi vestri in Vikia per malefactores & piratas , dum naves praedictae in portu supradicto sicut praemittitur remanserunt supra mare ut dicitur interfecti , de mandato vestro ut dicebant arrest-arunt , & diu sub aresto hujusmodi detinebant , quousque videlicet homines & marinarii praedicti de quadraginta 
 339 
 libris sterlingorum certo die statuto ad opus vestrum pro qualibet navi praedictarum solvendis inviti & coacti securitatem invenissent : Et similiter de eisdem navibus cum hominibus praedictis infra portum praedictum citra festum nativitatis Sancti Joannis Baptistae proximo futuro ad standum tunc ibidem de personis & navibus suis vestrae gratiae seu voluntatis arbitrio reducendis tres obsides ulterius liberassent : quod ipsis valde grave censetur , & auditu mirabile auribus audientium non immerito reputatur . Et quia contra rationem & aequitatem , omnemque justitiam before dinoscitur , atque legem , quod delinquentium culpae seu demerita in personis vel rebus illorum qui criminis rei conscii vel participes , seu de hujusmodi delinquentium societate non fuerunt , aliqualiter ulciscantur , vestram amicitiam affectuose requirimus & rogamus , quatenus praemissa diligenti meditation zelo justitiae ponderantes , obsides praedictos jubere velitis ab hostagiamento hujusmodi liberari , dictamque securitatem relaxari penitus & resolvi . Scientes pro certo , quod si malefactores praedicti , qui dictum militem vestrum , ut dicitur , occiderunt , alicubi infra regnum seu potestatem nostram poterunt inveniri , de ipsis justitiam & judicium secundum legem & consuetudinem ejusdem regni fieri faciemus . Non enim possumus his diebus aequanimiter tolerare , quod naves praedictae seu aliae de regno nostro , quae semper promptae ad nostrum servitium esse debent , extra idem regnum ad parts remotas se divertant sine nostra licentia speciali . Quid autem ad hanc nostram instantiam faciendum decreveritis in praemissis , nobis si placeat rescribatis per praesentium portatorem . Datae apud Windesore decimo sexto die Aprilis .

 The letters of Edward the second unto Haquinus king of Norway , concerning the English merchants arrested in Norway , and their goods to be freed from arrest . 
 O the mighty Prince , lord Haquinus , by the grace of God the famous king of Norway his most deer friend , Edward by the same grace of God , king of England , lord of Ireland , duke of Aquitaine , greeting and sincere love . We marvel not a little , and are much dis - 
 quieted in our cogitations , considering the grievances and oppressions , which ( as we have been informed by pitiful complaints ) are at this present , more then in times past , without any reasonable cause inflicted upon our subject's , which do usually resort unto your kingdom for traffics sake . For of late one William the son of Laurence of Wainfleete , and one Simon the son of Alan of the same town , and Guido the son of Mathew , and their associates our merchants , in complaining wise declared unto us : that having sent certain of their factors and servants , with three ships into your dominions , there to exercise traffic , and the said ships being laden in the haven of your town of Tonnesbergh , with Herrings and other commodities , to a great valve : and also the said mariners , men , and servants of the foresaid ships , being licenced by virtue of the safe conduct which you had granted them , freely to return from your kingdom unto the parts of England with their ships and goods aforesaid , but afterwards not being able to depart out of your haven by reason of contrary winds : certain of your bailiffs upon occasion of the slaughter of a knight being himself also of late your bailiff of Vikia , committed by malefactors and Pirates upon the sea , whilst the said ships remained in the haven aforesaid , 341 
 The town of Tonesbergh . 
 did at your commandment ( as they say ) arrest , and for a long season also detained under that arrest , the foresaid 
 ships , with all the men and goods that were in them : namely until such time , as the men and mariners aforesaid ( being driven perforce , and constrained thereunto ) should lay in sufficient security for the payment of fortie pounds sterling , upon a certain day appointed , unto your use , for every of the foresaid ships : and also until they had moreover delivered three pledges , for the bringing of the said ships and men back again into the foresaid haven , before the feast of the nativity of S. John the Baptist next ensuing , then and there to stand unto your favour and courtesy , as touching the said persons , and those ships of theirs : which dealing , the parties themselves take very grievously , yea , and all others that hear thereof think it to be a strange and unwonted course . And because it is most undoubtedly contrary to all reason , equity , justice , and law , that the faults or demerits of offenders should in any sort be punished in such persons , or in their goods , as neither have be accessory nor partakers in the crime , nor have had any society with the said offenders : we do heartily entreat and request your Highness , that weighing and pondering the matter in the balance of justice , you would of your love and friendship , command the foresaid pledges to be set at liberty , and the said security utterly to be released and acquitted . And know you this for a certainty , that if the foresaid malefactors , who ( as it is reported ) slew your Knight aforesaid , shall any where within our realm and dominions be found , we will cause justice and judgement to be executed upon them , according to the Law and custom of our say de Realm . For we cannot in these times conveniently and well endure , that the ships aforesaid , or any other ships of our kingdom ( which ought always to be in a readiness for our service ) should without speciali licence , depart out of our said kingdom , unto foreign dominions . Now , what you shall think good at this our request to perform in the premises , 
 342 
 may it please you by the bearer of these presents to return and answer unto us . Given at Windsore the 16. of April .
