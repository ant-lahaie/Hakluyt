The Queens Majesties letter to Theodore Ivanovich Emperor of Russia , 1591. 
 Lizabeth by the grace of God Queen of England , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith , etc. to the right high , mighty , and right noble prince Theodore Ivanovich great Lord , King , and great Duke of all Russia , Volodemer , Mosco , Novogrod , King of Cazan , and Astracan , 
 Lord of Vobsko , and great Duke of Smolensko , Otver , Ughory , Perm , Viatski , Bolgory , and other places : Lord and great Duke of Novogrod in the low country , of Chernigo , Rezan , Polotsky , Rostove , Yeraslave , Bealozero , and Lifland , of Oudorsky , Obdorsky , Condinsky , and commander of all Sibierland and the North coasts , great Lord over the country of Iversky , Grisinsky , Emperor of Kabardinsky , and of the country of Charkasky , and of the country of Gorsky , and Lord of many other countries' , our most deer and loving brother , greeting . Right noble and excellent prince , we have received your Majesties letters brought over by our merchant's in their return of their | | last voyage from your port of S. Nicholas ; which letters we have advisedly read and considered , and thereby perceive that your Majesty does greatly mislike of our late employment of Jerome Horsey into your dominions as our messenger with our Highness letters , and also that your Majesty does think that we in our letters sent by the said messenger have not observed that due order or respect which appertained to your princely majesty , in the form of the same letter , aswell touching the 422 
 enlargement of your Majesties style and titles of honour which your Majesty expected to have be therein more particularly expressed , as also in the adding of our greatest seal or signet of arms to the letters which we send to so great a Prince as your Majesty is : in any of which points we would have be very loath willingly to have given just cause of offence thereby to our most deer and loving brother . And as touching the said messenger Jerome Horsey we are sorry that contrary to our expectation he is fallen into your Majesties displeasure , whom we mind not to maintain in any his actions by which he hath so incurred your Majesties mislike : yet that we had reason at such time as we sent him to your Majesty to use his service as our messenger , we refer our selves to your princely judgement , praying your Majesty to reduce into your mind the especial commendation , which in your letters written unto us in the year 1585 , you made of the 1585. said Jerome Horsey his behaviour in your dominions : at which time your Majesty was pleased to use his service as your messenger to us , requiring our answer of your letters to be returned by him and by none other . That employment , with other occasions taken by your Majesty to use the service of the said Jerome Horsey ( as namely in the year 1587 ) when your Majesty sent him to us again with your letters , and your liberali and princely privilege at our request granted to our merchant's ( for which we have heretofore given thanks to your Majesty , so do we hereby reiterate our thankfulness for the same ) moved us to be of mind , that we could not make choice of any of our subject's so fit a messenger to your Majesty as he , whom your Majesty had at several times used upon your own occasions into this our Realm . But lest your highness should continue of the mind that the letters which you sent by our ambassador Giles Fletcher ( wherein some mention was made of your conceived displeasure against the said Horsey ) came not to our hands , and that we were kept 
 423 
 ignorant of the complaint which your Majesty made therein against the said Horsey , we do not deny but that we were acquainted aswell by our ambassador as by those letters of some displeasure conceived against him by your Majesty : but your said letters giving only a short generail mention of some misdemeanour committed by him , expressing no particulars , we were of opinion that this offence was not so heinous , as that it might utterly extinguish all your former princely favour towards him , but that upon his humble submission to your Majesty , or upon better examination of the matter of the displeasure conceived against him , the offence might have been either remitted , or he thereof might have cleared himself . And to that end we were not only by his great importunity long solicited , but by the intercession of some of our Nobility giving credit to his own defence , we were entreated on his behalf to use his service once again into Russia as our messenger to your Majesty , whereby he might have opportunity to deer himself , and either by his answer or by his submission recover your Majesties former favour : whereunto our princely nature was moved to yield , wishing the good of our subject so far forth as his desert might carry him , or his innocence clear him . 
 Thus noble Prince , our most loving and dearest brother , it may appear unto your Majesty how we were induced to use the service of the said messenger , aswell for the recovery of your Majesties favour towards him ( if he had be found worthy of it ) as for experience of the manners and fashions of your country , where he hath be much conversant . But sith by your Majesties letters it appears that he hath not cleared himself in your Majesties sighed , we mean not to use him in any such price hereafter . 
 And as touching your Majesties conceit of the brevity which we used in the setting down of your Majesties style and titles of honour : as nothing is further from 424 
 us , then to abridge so great and mighty a Prince of the honour due unto him ( whom we hold for his greatness to deserve more honour then we are able to give him ) so shall we need no further nor surer argument to clear us of the suspicion of the detracting from your Majesty any part of your just and princely honour and greatness , then the consideration of our own style , which is thus contracted , videlicet , Elizabeth by the grace of God Queen of England , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith etc. which kingdoms and dominions of ours are expressed by these general words , videlicet , England , France , and Ireland : in every of which there are several principalities , dukedoms , earldoms , provinces and countries' : which being severally expressed would enlarge much our style , and make it of great length ; which by our progenitors hath not be used : notwithstanding , we think it no dishonour to us , compendiously to abridge the same in all our writings and letters written to what Prince , King , or Potentate soever . Whereupon we infer , that holding your Majesties general style , we offer your Highness no dishonour in not expressing all the particular provinces : albeit we can willingly content our self , upon the knowledge of your usages and customs , to observe that course , which your self shall think most honourable . And for the sealing up of our letters which we write to all our allies , kinsmen , and friends , Kings and Princes , we have in use two several seals ; both which we esteem alike honourable , being our princely seals . And as the volume of our letters falls out to be great or small , so accordingly is our greater or lesser seal annexed to the said letters , without esteeming either of them more or less honourable then the other . So as , our most loving and dearest brother , in the said letters there was nothing done of purpose to detract from your Majesty any thing of the usual regard , which our Highness was wont to yield unto your most noble father of famous memory Ivan 
 425 
 Basilivich Emperor of all Russia , or to your self , our dearest brother . For the residue of the points of your Majesties letters concerning the entertainment of our ambassador , and proceeding in the cause of Anthonie Marsh we hold our self satisfied with your princely answer , and do therein note and honourable and princely care in your Majesty to prevent the like troubles , controversies and suits , that Marshes cause stirred up between our merchant's and your subject's , which is , that your Majesty doth purpose from time to time to purge your Country of such stragglers of our subject's , as doe or shall hereafter abide there , and are not of the Company of our merchant's , but contemptuously depart out of our land without our Highness licence : of which sort there are presented unto us from our merchant's the names of these several persons , videlicet , Richard Cocks , Bennet Jackman , Rainold Kitchen , Simon Rogers , Michael Lane , Thomas Worsenham : whom it may please your Majesty by your princely order to dismiss out of your land , that they may be sent home in the next ships , to avoid the mislike which their residence in those parts might breed to the disturbance of our brotherly league , and the impeaching of the intercourse . 
 And whereas , most loving and dearest brother , one William Turnebull a subject of ours is lately deceased in your kingdom , one with whom our merchant's have had much controversy for great sums of money due unto them by him while he was their Agent in their affairs of merchandises : which differences by arbitrable order were reduced to the sum of 3000 rubbles , and so much should have been paid by him as may appear by your Majesties council or magistrates of justice by very credible information and testimony : and whereas also the said Turnbull was further indebted by bills of his own hand to diverse of our subject's , amounting in the whole , to the sum of 1326 pounds , which bills are exemplified under our great seal of England , 426 
 and to be sent over with this bearer : of which sums he hath often promised payment : it may please your most excellent Majesty in your approved love to justice , to give order to your favourable council and magistrates , that those several debts may be satisfied to our merchant's and subject's out of the goods , merchandise , and debts which are due to the state of the said Turnbull : whereof your Majesties council shall informed by the Agent of our merchant's . 
 We trust we shall not need to make any new request by motion to your Majesty that some order might be taken for the finding out of the rest of our merchant's goods seized to your majesties use in the hands and possession of John Chappel their servant , being a thing granted , and no doubt already performed by your Majesties order . We therefore entreat your Majesty , that as conveniently as may be , satisfaction or recompense be given to our said merchant's towards the repairing of their sundry great losses aswell therein as otherwise by them of late sundry ways sustained . And lastly , our most deer and loving brother , as nothing in all these our occasions is to be preferred before our entire league and amity , descending upon us as and inheritance , in succession from both our ancestors and noble progenitors : so let us be careful on both sides by all good means to hold and continue the same to our posterity for ever . And if any mistaking or error of either side do rise , in not accomplishing of circumstances agreeable to the fashion of either of our countries' and kingdoms , let the same upon our interchangeable letters be reconciled , that our league and amity be no way impeached for any particular occasion whatsoever . And thus we recommend your Majesty to the tuition of the most High . From our royal Palace of Whitehall the 14 of January , anno Domini 1591. 
 The Emperor seized our merchant's goods .
