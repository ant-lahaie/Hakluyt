 be by way of articles exhibited and delivered unto the said English ambassadors in the land of Prussia , which for diverse causes , could not as then be ended : therefore it is concluded and agreed upon between the ambassadors , and the commissioners aforesaid , that the said citizens and merchants may in the town of Dordract in Holland , upon the first day of the month of May next ensuing ( at the which time and place , the continuation and prorogation of all other articles not fully declared in the parts of Prussia , shall be put in ure ) by themselves or their lawful procurators , make their appearance , for the obtaining of a convenient , just , and reasonable reformation of all injuries attempted against them , then , or at some other times within one whole year next following , and not afterwards , being effectually set down and limited , at the place aforesaid , by the consent of the ambassadors and commissioners of either part , all lawful impediments ceasing . 
 Provided always , that the valve and price of all wares , goods , and merchandises , whereof the said citizens and merchants of Livonia , in their articles received by the said English ambassadors , as is aforesaid , do make mention , shall be justly esteemed , prized , and approved , not by any of England , or of Prussia , or of Livonia , but by some other indifferent merchants of good credit , valuing them at the true rate of merchants , which such like merchandise would have amounted unto , if , at the time when they were taken , they had be to be sold at the town of Bruges in Flanders . 
 Forasmuch also , as diverse and sundry Prussians ( who exhibited manifold Articles of complaints , being received by the said English Ambassadors , at their abided in Prussia ) made not their personali appearance , before the said English Ambassadors , in the land of Prussia aforesaid : The prorogation abovementioned was made unto the first day of the month of May : and also it was agreed upon by the said Ambassadors , Procurators , and Commissioners , that the said parties which had not 50 
 appeared before shall have liberty granted them , lawfully to make their appearance , upon the first of May aforesaid , at the town of Dordract , either by themselves or by their Procurators , and also to bring with them the letters testimonial , and patents , sealed with the seal of the said Lord the Master generail , ( he having first of all received found and sufficient information from the cities whereof the parties plaintiff are citizens , of the damages and grievances any way unjustly inflicted upon them or any of them by the English ) to the end that they may there by articles conveniently declare and prove , before the Ambassadors , Procurators , messengers , and Commissioners of both parts , the rate and valve of their said goods : and that in so doing they may obtain convenient , just , and reasonable restitution , for all acts unjustly attempted against them , then , or at some other times effectually to be set down and limited at the foresaid place by the consent of the Ambassadors and Commissioners of both parts , even as it was above promised unto the merchants of Livonia . 
 But if they of Prussia last abovementioned , shall not upon the first of May , and at the place appointed , for some cause , make their appearance , that then it shall lawful for them , at any time within one whole year next following , to repair unto the lord Chancellor of England , at the city of London , and to insinuate and declare unto him their complaints before exhibited unto the said English Ambassadors in the land of Prussia , or which complaints should have be delivered at the foresaid term and place , or else , the which were not then and there fully finished and dispatched : and also by articles as is aforesaid , to declare and prove the true worth and estimation of all damages and grievances any ways unjustly offered by the English unto them or any of them : to the end that they may ( as it is above mentioned ) effectually receive , and also speedily and easily obtain convenient , just , and reasonable reformation and satisfaction , for all acts unjustly attempted against them , 
 which are contained in the complaints not as yet fully declared and finished . 
 Moreover , it is appointed and agreed upon between the foresaid Ambassadors and Commissioners : that the forenamed sovereign Lord & the said lord the Master general are to send and set forward their Ambassadors , messengers , and Commissioners , upon the first of May unto the place appointed , to treat , parley , agree , and conclude about those affairs , which shall then and there happen to be treated of and handled among them . 
 Furthermore , between the often mentioned Ambassadors , Procurators , and Commissioners , it is enacted and concluded : that unto all and singular lawful statutes , Note well , ordinations , and prohibitions framed , made , and ordained , by the said lord the Master generail , in his land of Prussia , or by his Proconsuls and Consuls , and his governors of cities , towns , villages , and of other places in the land of Prussia , unto the observation whereof , aswell the subjects of the said Master general , as foreigners and strangers , are tied and bound : unto the very same statutes , ordinations , and prohibitions , all English merchants whatsoever resorting unto the land of Prussia , must be firmly bounden and subject . 
 Also it is ordained , that whatsoever sale-clothes are already transported , or at any time hereafter to be transported out of England into Prussia by the English merchants , and shall there be offered to be sold , whither they be whole clothes or half clothes , they must contain both their ends . 
 Lastly , that the matters abovementioned fallen not short and void of their wished effect ; the treaty and conference about all and singular damages and grievances ( whereof there is not as yet done , but there must be , by the virtue of these presents , performed , a reformation and amendment ) must be continued and prorogued until the first of May next ensuing : as by these presents they are continued and prorogued with the continuation of the days then immediately following , at the town of 
 Dordract aforesaid : at the which time and place , or at other times and places , in the mean space , as occasion shall serve , by both parties to be limited and assigned , or else within one year after the said first day of the month of May next ensuing bee expired : the hurt and damaged parties generally beforementioned , shall have performed unto them a convenient , just , and reasonable reformation on both parts . Provided always , if within the term of the said year , some convenient , just , and reasonable reformation be not performed unto the parties injuried , and endamaged , which are generally above mentioned : that then , within three whole months after the foresaid year shall expired , the Prussians shall depart out of the realms and dominions of the said Sovereign Lord the king of England , together with their merchandise , and with other goods which they shall have got or bought , within the space of the foresaid three months : and that the English men also are likewise in all respects bounden to avoid and ( no lawful impediment hindering them ) to withdraw themselves and to depart out of the territories and dominions of the said Master generail , without all molestation , perturbation , and impediment whatsoever , none other intimation or admonition being necessary in this regard . 
 Howbeit lest that by the robberies and piracies of some insolent and perverse people , matter should be ministered unto the said lord the Master general , of swerving from the faithful observation of the foresaid agreements , or ( which God forbid ) any occasion be given him of not observing them : it is also decreed by the often above mentioned Ambassadors and messengers , that if the goods and merchandise of any of the said lord Master general his subjects whatsoever shall be from henceforth unjustly taken upon the Sea , by any English Pirates , and shall carried into the realm of England , and there received , that the Governors and keepers of ports , and of other places ( with whatsoever names they be called ) at the which ports and places 
 such merchandises and goods shall chance to arrive , being only informed of the said goods and merchandises , by sole report , or ( other proofs wanting ) by probable suspicion are bound to arrest and to keep them in safe custody , favourably to be restored unto the owners thereof , whensoever they shall be lawfully demanded : which if they shall omit or deny to perrorme , from thenceforth the said governors and keepers are bound to make unto the parties endamaged , a recompense of their losses . 
 And for fault of justice to be executed , by the said governors and keepers , our sovereign lord the king above nam , after he shall conveniently be requested by the parties damnified , is bound within three months next ensuing ( all lawful impediments being excepted ) to make correspondent , just , and reasonable satisfaction , unto the said parties endamaged . Otherwise , that it shall be right lawful for the said lord the Master generail , to arrest , and after the arrest to keep in safe custody the goods of the English merchants being in the land of Prussia , to the condign satisfaction of such injuries , as have be offered unto his subject's , until his said subject's be justly and reasonably contented . 
 Likewise also in all respects , the same justice is to be done unto the English by the said Lord the Master general and his subject's in Prussia , even as it hath be enacted and decreed in the above written clause , beginning , Casterum ne per etc. In English . Howbeit lest that etc. for the said Master general , and his subject's by the foresaid ambassadors of England , and the commissioners of the said lord the Master generail , that in like cases justice ought to be administered on the behalf of himself , and of his subject's in the realm of England . 
 And that all and singular the covenants above written , may in time to come , by the parties whom they concern , firmly and inviolably be observed ; the forenamed ambassadors , messengers , and commissioners , all and 
 every of them , for the full credit , probation , and testimony of all the premises , have unto these present Indentures , made for the same purpose , caused every one of their seals with their own hands to be put . One part of the which indentures remains in the custody of the English ambassadors , and the other part in the hands of the commissioners of Prussia . Given at the castle of Marienburgh in Prussia , in the year of our Lord 1405. upon the 8. day of the month of October .
