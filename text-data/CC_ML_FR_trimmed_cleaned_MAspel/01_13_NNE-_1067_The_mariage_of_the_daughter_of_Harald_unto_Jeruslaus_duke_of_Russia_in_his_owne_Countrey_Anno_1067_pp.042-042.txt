 1067. 
 Araldo caeso , filii ejus duo confestim in Daniam cum sorore migrarunt . Quos Sweno , paterni illorum meriti oblitus consanguineae pietatis more accepit , puellamque Ruthenorum regi Waldemaro , ( qui & ipse Jarislaus a suis est appellatus ) nuptum dedit . Eidem postmodum nostri temporis 
 dux , ut sanguinis , ita & nominis haeres , ex filia nepos obvenit . Itaque hinc Britannicus , inde Eous sanguis in salutarem nostri principis ortum confluens communem stirpem duarum gentium ornamentum effecit . 
 The same in English . 
 HArald being slain his two sons with their sister sped themselves immediately into Denmarke . Whom Sweno forgetting their father's deserts received in most kind and friendly manner , and bestowed the young damosel in marriage upon Waldemarus king of Russia who was also called by his subject's Jarislaus . Afterwards the said Waldemarus had by his daughter a nephew being duke at this present , who succeeded his predecessor both in lineal descent and in name also . Wherefore the English blood on the one side and the Russian on the other side concurring to the joyful birth of our prince , caused that mutual kindred to be and ornament unto both nations .
