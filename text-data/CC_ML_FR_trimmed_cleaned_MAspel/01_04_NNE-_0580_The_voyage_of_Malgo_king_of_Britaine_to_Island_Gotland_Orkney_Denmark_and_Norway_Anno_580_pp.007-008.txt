A testimony out of the foresaid Galfridus Monumetensis , concerning the conquests of Malgo , king of England . Lib. 11. cap . 7. 
 Ortiporio successit Malgo , omnium fere Britanniae pulcherrimus , multorum tyrannorum depulsor , robustus armis , largior caeteris , & ultra modum 
 probitate praeclarus . Hic etiam totam Insulam obtinuit , & sex conprovinciales Oceani Insulas : Hyberniam videlicet , atque Islandiam , Gotlandiam , Orcades , Noruegiam , Daciam , adjecit dirissimis praeliis potestati suae . 
 A It Algo succeeded Vortiporius which was the goodliest EVA man in person of all Britaine , a prince that expulsed many tyrants . He was strong and valiant in war , taller then most men that then lived , and exceeding famous for his virtues . This king also obtained the government of the whole Island of Britaine , and by most sharp battles he recovered to his Empire the sixe Islands of the Ocean sea , which before had be made tributaries by king Arthur , namely Ireland , Island , Gotland , Orkney , Norway , and Denmarke .
