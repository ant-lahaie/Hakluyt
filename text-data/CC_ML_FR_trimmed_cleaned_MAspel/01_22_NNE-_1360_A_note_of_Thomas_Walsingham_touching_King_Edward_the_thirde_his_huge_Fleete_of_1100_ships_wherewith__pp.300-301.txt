A note out of Thomas Walsingham touching the huge Fleet of eleven hundred well furnished ships wherewith king Edward the third passed over unto Calais in the year * 359 - 
 AND no gratias 1359. Johannes Rex Franciae sub umbra pacis , & dolose obtulit Regi Angliae Flandriam , Picardiam , Aquitaniam , aliasque terras quas equitaverat & vastarat : pro quibus omnibus ratificandis idem Rex Edwardus in Franciam nuncios suos direxit ; quibus omnibus Franci contradixerunt . Unde motus Rex Anglias , celeriter se & suos praeparavit ad transfretandum , ducens secum principem Walliae Edwardum suum primogenitum , ducem Henricum Lancastriae , & fere proceres omnes , quos comitabantur vel sequebantur poene mille currus , habuitque apud Sanwicum instructas optime undecies centum naves , & cum hoc apparatu ad humiliandum Francorum fastum Franciam navigavit , relicto domino Thoma de Woodstock filio suo juniore admodum parvulo , Anglici regni custode , sub tutela tamen . 
 The same in English . 
 IN the year of our Lord 1359. John the French king craftily , and under pretence of peace , offered unto Edward the third king of England , Flanders , Picardie , Gascoigne , and other territories which he had spoiled and wasted : for the ratifying of which agreement , the foresaid king Edward sent his ambassadors into France , but the Frenchmen gainsaid them in all their articles and 300 
 demands . Whereupon the king of England being provoked , speedily prepared himself and his forces to cross the seas , carrying with him Edward Prince of Wales his heir apparent , and Henry duke of Lancaster and almost all his Nobles , with a thousand wagons and carts attending upon them . And the said king had at Sandwich eleven hundred ships exceedingly well furnished : with which preparation he passed over the seas , to abate the Frenchmens arrogancy : leaving his younger son Thomas of Woodstocke , being very tender of age , as his vicegerent in the Realm of England ; albeit not without a protector , etc.
