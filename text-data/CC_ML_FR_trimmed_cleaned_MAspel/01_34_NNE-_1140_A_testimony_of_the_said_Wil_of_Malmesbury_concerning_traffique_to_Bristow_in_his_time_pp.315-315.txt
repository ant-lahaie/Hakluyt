The aforesaid William of Malmesburie writeth of traffic in his time to Bristowe in his fourth book de gestis pontificum Anglorum , after this manner . 
 N eadem valle est vicus celeberrimus Bristow nomine , in quo est navium portus ab Hibernia & Norwegia & caeteris transmarinis terris venientium receptaculum , ne scilicet genitalibus divitiis tam fortunata regio peregrinarum opum frauderetur commercio . 
 The same in English . 
 IN the same valley stands the famous Town of Bristow , with and Haven belonging thereunto , which 
 is a commodious and safe receptacle for all ships directing their course for the same , from Ireland , Norway , and Norway . other outlandish and foren countries' : namely that a region so fortunate and blessed with the riches that nature hath vouchsafed thereupon should not be destitute of the wealth and commodities of other lands .
