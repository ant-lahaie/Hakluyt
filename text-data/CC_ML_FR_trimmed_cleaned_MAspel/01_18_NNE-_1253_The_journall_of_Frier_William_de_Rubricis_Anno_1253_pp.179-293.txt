Itinerarium fratris Willielmi de Rubruquis de ordine fratrum Minorum , Galli , Anno gratias 1253. and parts Orientales . 
 EXcellentissimo Domino & Christianissimo , Lodovico Dei gratia Regi Francorum illustri , frater Willielmus de Rubruquis in ordine fratrum Minorum minimus salutem , & semper triumphare in Christo . Scriptum est in Ecclesiastico de sapiente , In terram alienarum gentium transibit , bona & mala in omnibus tentabit . Hoc opus , Domine mi Rex , feci : sed utinam ut sapiens & non stultus . Multi enim faciunt quod facit sapiens , sed non 179

 sapienter , sed magis stulte : de quorum numero timeo me esse . Tamen quocunque modo fecerim ; quia dixistis mihi quando recessi a vobis , ut omnia scriberem vobis , quaecunque viderem inter Tartaros , & etiam monuistis ut non timerem vobis scribere longas 1 iteras , facio quod injunxistis : Cum timore tamen & verecundiam , quia verba congrua mihi non suppetunt , quae debeam tantae scribere Majestati . Noverit ergb vestra sancta majestas , qubd anno Domini millessimo ducentessimo , quinquagessimo tertio , nonas Maii ingressi sumus mare Ponti , quod Bulgarici vocant , Majus Mare : & habet mille octo milliaria in longum , ut didici i mercatoribus , & distinguitur quasi in duas parts . Circa medium enim ejus sunt duae provinciae terrae , una ad Aquilonem , & alia ad meridiem . Illa quae est ad meridiem dicitur Synopolis ; & est castrum & portus Soldani Turchiae . Quae verb ad Aquilonem est , est Provincia [ I - 72J quaedam , quae nunc dicitur a Latinis Gasaria , a Graecis verb qui inhabitant eam super littus maris dicitur Cassaria , hoc est Caesaria . Et sunt promontoria quaedam extendentia se in mare , & contra meridiem versus Synopolim . Et sunt trecenta midiaria inter Synopolim & Cassariam . Ita quod sint septingenta miliaria ab istis punctis versus Constantinopolim in longum & latum : & septingenta versus Orientem : hoc est , Hiberiam , quae est provincia Georgiae . Ad provinciam Gasariae sive Casariae applicuimus , qua : est quasi triangularis , ad Occidentem habens civitatem , quae dicitur Kersova , in qua fuit Sanctus Clemens marterizatus . Et navigantes coram ea vidimus insulam in qua est templum illud quod dicitur Angelicis manibus praeparatum . In medio vero quasi in cuspide ad Soldala . meridiem habet civitatem quae dicitur Soldaia , quae ex 
 transverso respicit Synopolim : Et illuc applicant omnes Mercatores venientes de Turchia volentes ire ad terras Aquilonares , & e contrario venientes de Rossia & terris Aquilonaribus , volentes transire in Turchiam . Illi portant varium & grisiam , & alias pelles pretiosas . Alii portant telas de cottone sive bombasio , & pannos sericos & species aromaticas . Ad Orientem verb illius provinciae est civitas 180 
 quae dicitur Matriga , ubi cadit fluvius Tanais in mare Matriga Ponti per orificium habens latitudinem duodecem milii-arium . Ille enim fluvius antequam ingrediatur mare Ponti , facit quoddam mare versus Aquilonem , habens in latitudine & longitudine septinginta milliaria , nusquam habens profunditatem ultra sex passus , unde magna vasa non ingrediuntur illud . Said mercatores the Constanti-nopoli applicantes ad praedictam civitatem Matertam , mittunt barcas suas usque ad flumen Tanaim , ut emant pisces siccatos , sturiones , thosas , borbatas , & alios pisces infinitae multitudinis . Praedicta vero provincia Cassaria cingitur mari in tribus lateribus : ad Occidentem scilicet , ubi est Kersova civitas Clementis , ad meridiem ubi est civitas Soldaia , ad quam applicuimus , quae est cuspis provinciae , & ad Orientem Maricandis , ubi est civitas Materta , & orificium Tanais . Ultra illud orificium est Zikia , quae Zikla . non obedit Tartaris : Et Suevi & Hiberi ad Orientem , qui non obediunt Tartaris . Postea versus meridiem est Trapesunda quae habet proprium Dominum nomine Guidonem , qui est de genere imperatorum Constantino-politanorum , qui obedit Tartaris : postea Synopolis quae est Soldani Turchiae qui similiter obedit : postea terra Vastacii cujus filius dicitur Astar ab avo materno , qui non obedit . Ab orificio Tanais versus Occidentem usque ad Danubium totum est subditum . Etiam ultra Danubium versus Constantinopolim , Valakia , quae est terra Assani , & minor Bulgaria usque in Solonomam omnes solvunt eis tributum . Et etiam ultra tributum condictum sumpserunt annis nuper transactis de qualibet domo securim unam , & totum frumentum quod invenerunt in massa . Applicuimus ergo Soldaiae in 12. Kalendas Junii : & praevenerant nos quidam mercatores de Constantinopoli , qui dixerunt venturos illuc nuncios de terra sancta volentes ire and Sartach . Ego tamen praedicaveram publice in Ramis Palmarum apud Sanctam Sophiam , quod non essem nuncius , nec vester , nec alicujus , sed ibam apud illos incredulos secundum regulam nostram . Tunc cum applicuissem , monebant me dicti mercatores ut caute loquerer , 
 181 
 quia dixerunt me esse nuncium , & si non dicerem me esse nuncium , quod non praeberetur mihi transitus . Tunc loquutus sum hoc modo ad capitaneos civitatis , imo ad vicarios capitaneorum , quia capitanei iverant ad Baatu portantes tributum , & non fuerant adhuc reversion . Nos audivimus , dixi , de Domino vestro Sartach in Terra Sancta quod esset Christianus : & gavisi sunt inde vehementer Christiani , & praecipue Dominus Rex Francorum Christianissimus , qui ibi peregrinatur , & pugnat contra Saracenos , ut eripiat loca sancta de manibus eorum : unde volo ire ad Sartach , & portare ei literas Domini Regis , in quibus monet eum de utilitate totius Christianitatis . Et ipsi receperunt nos gratanter , & dederunt nobis hospitium in ecclesiam Episcopali . Et Episcopus ipsius ecclesiae fuerat ad Sartach , qui multa bona dixit mihi de Sartach , quae ego postea non inveni . Tunc dederunt nobis optionem utrum vellemus habere bigas cum bobus ad portandum res nostras vel equos pro summariis . Et mercatores Constantinopolitani consuluerunt mihi quod non acciperem bigas , imo quod emerem proprias bigas coopertas , in quibus apportant Ruteni pelles suas , & in illis includerem res nostras quas vellem quotidie deponere , quia si acciperem equos , oporteret me in qualibet Herbergia deponere & reponere super alios , & praeterea equitarem lentiori gressu juxta boves . Et tunc acquievi consilio eorum malo , tum quia fui in itinere usque Sarthach duobus mensibus , quod potuissem uno mense fecisse , si ivissem equis . Attuleram mecum de Constantinopoli fructus & vinum muscatum , & biscoctum delicatum de consilio mercatorum ad praesentandum capitaneis primis , ut facilius pateret mihi transitus ; quia nullus apud eos respicitur rectis oculis , qui venit vacua manu . Quae omnia posui in una biga , quando non inveni ibi capitaneos civitatis , quia dicebant mihi , quod gratissima forent Sarthach , si possem defer ea usque ad eum . Arripuimus ergo iter tunc circa Kalend. Junii cum bigis nostris quatuor coopertis & cum aliis duabus quas accepimus ab eis , In quibus portabantur lectisternia ad dormiendum de 
 182 
 nocte , & quinque equos dabant nobis ad equitandum . Eramus enim quinque personae . Ego & socius meus frater Bartholomeus de Cremona , & Goset lator praesentium , & homo dei Turgemannus , & puer Nicolaus , quem emeram Constantinopoli de nostra eleemosynam . Dederunt etiam duos homines qui ducebant bigas & custodiebant boves & equos . Sunt autem alta promontoria super Mare a Kersova usque ad orificium Tanais : & sunt quadraginta castella inter Kersovam & Soldaiam , quorum quodlibet fere habet proprium idioma : inter quos erant multi Goti , quorum idioma est Teutonicum . Post illa montana versus Aquilonem est pulcherrima sylva in planicie , plena fontibus & rivulis : Et post illam sylvam est planicies maxima , quae durat per quinque dietas usque ad extremitatem illius provinciae ad aquilonem , quae coarctatur habens Mare ad Orientem & Occidentem : Ita quod est unum fossatum magnum ab uno Mari usque ad aliud . In illa planicie solebant esse Comani antequam venirent Tartari , & cogebant civitates praedictas & castra ut darent eis tributum . Et cum venerunt Tartari , tanta multitudo Comanorum intravit provinciam illam , qui omnes fugerunt usque ad ripam Maris , quod comedebant se mutuo vivi morientes : secundum quod narravit mihi quidam mercator , qui hoc vidit : Quod vivi devorabant & lacerabant dentibus carnes crudas mortuorum , sicut canes cadavera . 
 Versus extremitatem illius provinciae sunt lacus multi & magni : in quorum ripis sunt fontes salmastri , quorum aqua , quam cito intrat lacum , efficit salem durum ad modum glaciei . Et de illis salinis habent Baatu & Sartach magnos reditus : quia de tota Russia veniunt illuc pro sale : & de qualibet biga onusta daunt duas telas de cottone valentes dimidiam Ipperperam . Veniunt & per Mare multae naves pro sale , quae omnes daunt tributum secundum sui quantitatem . Postquam ergo recessimus de Soldaia , tertia die invenimus Tartaros : inter quos cum intraveram , visum fuit mihi recte quod ingrederer quoddam aliud saeculum . Quorum vitam & mores vobis describam prout possum . 
 183 
 VIUsquam habent manentem civitatem , sed futuram 11 ignorant . Inter se diviserunt Scythiam , quae durat a Danubio usque ad ortum solis . Et quilibet Capitaneus , secundum quod habet plures vel pauciores homines sub se , scit terminos pascuorum suorum , & ubi debet pascere hyeme & aestate , vere & autumno . In hyeme enim descendunt ad calidiores regiones versus meridiem . In aestate ascendunt ad frigidiores versus aquilonem . Loca pascuosa sine aquis pascunt in hyeme quando est ibi nix , quia nivem habent pro aqua . Domum in qua dormiunt fundant super rotam de virgis cancellatis , cujus tigna sunt de virgis , & conveniunt in unam parvulam rotam superius , de qua ascendit collum sursum tanquam fumigatorium , quam cooperiunt filtro albo : & frequentius imbuunt etiam filtrum calce vel terra alba & pulvere ossium , ut albens splendeat , & aliquando nigro . Et filtrum illud circa collum superius decorant pulchra varietate picturae . Ante ostium similiter suspendunt filtrum opere polimitario variatum . Consumunt enim filtrum coloratum in faciendo vites & arbores , aves 8c bestias . Et faciunt tales domos ita magnas , quod habent triginta pedes in latitudine . Ego enim mensuravi semel latitudinem inter vestigia rotarum unius bigae viginti pedum : & quando domus erat super bigam excedebat extra rotas in utroque later quinque pedibus ad minus . Ego numeravi in una biga viginti duos boves trahentes unam domum : Undecem in uno ordine secundum latitudinem bigae , 8c alios undecem ante illos : Axis bigae erat magnus ad modum arboris navis : Et unus homo stabat in ostio domus super bigam minans boves . Insuper faciunt quadrangulos de virgulis fissis attenuatis ad quantitatem unius arcae magnae : 8c postea de una extremitate ad aliam elevant testudinem de similibus virgis , & ostiolum faciunt in anteriori extremitate : & postea cooperiunt illam cistam sive domunculam filtro nigro imbuto sevo sive lacte ovino , ne possit penetrari pluvia : quod similiter decorant opere polimitario vel plumario . Et 184 
 in talibus arcis ponunt totam suppellectilem suam & thesaurum : quas ligant fortiter super bigas alteras quas trahunt cameli , ut possint transvadare flumina . Tales arcas nunquam deponunt de bigis . Quando deponunt domus suas mansionarias , semper vertunt portam ad meridiem ; & consequenter collocant bigas cum arcis hinc & inde prope domum ad dimidium jactum lapidis : ita quod domus stat inter duos ordines bigarum quasi inter duos muros . Matronae faciunt sibi pulcherrimas bigas , quas nescirem vobis describere nisi per picturam . II Imo omnia depinxissem | | Nota. vobis si scivissem pingere . Unus dives Moal sive Tartar habet bene tales bigas cum arcis ducentas vel centum . 
 Baatu habet sexdecem uxores : quaelibet habet unam magnam domum , exceptis aliis parvis , quas collocant post magnam , quae sunt quasi camerae ; in quibus habitant puellae . Ad quamlibet istarum domorum appendent ducentae bigae . Et quando deponunt domus , prima uxor deponit suam curiam in capite occidentali , & postea aliae secundum ordinem suum : ita quod ultima uxor erit in capite Orientali : & erit spacium inter curiam unius dominae & alterius , jactus unius lapidis . Unde curia unius divitis Moal apparebit quasi una magna Villa : tunc paucissimi viri erunt in ea . Una muliercula ducet 20. bigas vel 30. Terra enim plana est . Et ligant bigas cum bobus vel camelis unam post aliam : & sedebit muliercula in anteriori minans bovem , & omnes aliae pari gressu sequentur . Si contingat venire ad aliquem malum passum , solvunt eas & transducunt sigillatim : Vadunt enim lento gressu , sicut agnus vel bos potest ambulare . 
 De lectis eorum & poculis . 
 POstquam deposuerint domus versa porta ad meridiem , collocant lectum domini ad partem aquilonarem . 
 Locus mulierum est semper ad latus Orientale hoc est ad sinistrum domini domus cum sedet in lecto suo versa fancy ad meridiem : locus vero virorum ad latus occidental , hoc est ad dextrum . Viri ingredientes domum nullo modo suspenderent pharetram ad partem mulierum . Et 185 
 super caput Domini est semper una imago quasi puppa & statuuncula de filtro , quam vocant fratrem domini : alia similis super caput dominas , quam vocant fratrem dominas , affixa parieti : & superius inter utramque illarum est una parvula , macilenta , quae est quasi custos totius domus . Domina domus ponit ad latus suum dextrum ad pedes lecti in eminenti loco pelliculam hoedinam impletam lana vel alia materia , & juxta illam statuunculam parvulam respicientem famulas & mulieres . Juxta ostium ad partem mulieris est iterum alia imago cum ubere vaccino , pro mulieribus quae mungunt vaccas . De officio faemina-rum est mungere vaccas . Ad aliud latus ostii versus viros est alia statua cum ubere equae pro viris qui mungunt equas . Et cum convenerint ad potandum primo spargunt de potu illi imagini , quae est super caput domini : postea aliis imaginibus per ordinem : postea exit minister domum cum cipho & potu , & spargit ter ad meridiem , qualibet vice flectendo genu ; & hoc ad reverentiam ignis : postea ad Orientem ad reverentiam aeris : postea ad Occidentem ad reverentiam aquae : ad aquilonem projiciunt pro mortuis . Quando tenet dominus ciphum in manu & debet bibere , tunc primo antequam bibat , infundit terrae partem suam . Si bibit sedens super equum , infundit antequam bibat , super collum vel crinem equi . Postquam vero minister sic sparserit ad quatuor latera mundi , revertitur in domum & sunt parati duo famuli cum duobus ciphis & totidem patenis ut deferant potum domino & uxori sedenti juxta eum sursum in lecto . Et cum habet plures uxores , illa cum qua dormit in nocte sedet juxta eum in die : & oportet quod omnes aliae veniant ad domum illam illa die ad bibendum : & ibi tenetur curia illa die : & xenia quae deferuntur , illa deponuntur in thesauris illius dominae . Bancus ibi est cum utre lactis vel cum alio potu & cum ciphis . 
 186 
 De potibus eorum & qualiter provocant alios ad bibendum . 
 FAciunt in hyeme optimum potum , de risio , de millio , de meile : claret sicut vinum . Et defertur eis vinum a remotis partibus . In aestate non curant nisi de Cosmos . Stat semper infra domum ad introitum portae , & juxta illud stat citharista cum citherula sua . Citheras & vielas nostras non vidi ibi , sed multa alia instrumenta , quae apud nos non habentur . Et cum incipit bibere tunc unus ministrorum exclamat alta voce , WOULD : & citharista in percutit cicharum . Et quando faciunt festum magnum , Fl°ri < ia-tunc omnes plaudunt manibus & saltant ad vocem citharae , viri coram Domino , & mulieres coram domina . 
 Et postquam dominus biberit , tunc exclamat minister sicut prius , & tacet citharista : tunc bibunt omnes in circuitu viri & mulieres : & aliquando bibunt certatim valde turpiter & gulose . Et quando volunt aliquem provocare ad potum arripiunt eum per aures & trahunt fortiter ut dilatent ei gulam , & plaudunt & saltant coram eo . Item cum aliqui volunt facere magnum festum & gaudium , unus accipit ciphum plenum , & alii duo sunt ei i dextris & sinistris : & sic illi tres veniunt cantantes usque ad illum cui debent porrigere ciphum , & cantant & saltant coram eo : & cum porrigit manum ad recipiendum ciphum , ipsi subito resiliunt , & iterum sicut prius rever - tuntur , & sic illudunt ei ter vel quater retrahendo ciphum , donec fuerit bene exhileratus & bonum habeat appetitum , & tunc daunt ei ciphum , & cantant & plaudunt manibus & terunt pedibus donec biberit . 
 De cibariis eorum . 
 DE cibis & victualibus eorum noveritis , quod indifferenter comedunt omnia morticinia sua . Et inter tot pecora & armenta non potest esse quin multa animalia moriantur . Tamen in aestate quamdiu durat eis cosmos , hoc est lac equinum , non curant de alio cibo . Unde tunc si contingat eis mori bovem vel equum , siccant carnes 187 
 scindendo per tenues pecias & suspendendo ad solemn & ventum , quae statim sine sale siccantur absque aliquo faetore . De intestinis equorum faciunt andulges meliores quam de porcis : quas comedunt recentes : reliquas carnes reservant ad hyemem . De pellibus boum faciunt utres magnos , quos mirabiliter siccant ad fumum . De posteriori parte pellis equi faciunt pulcherrimos soculares . De carnem unius arietis daunt comedere quinquaginta hominibus vel centum . Scindunt enim minutatim in scutella cum sale & aqua , aliam enim salsam non faciunt , & tunc cum puncto cultelli vel furcinula , quas proprias faciunt ad hoc , cum qua solemus comedere pira & poma cocta in vino , porrigunt cuilibet circumstantium buccellam unam vel duas , secundum multitudinem comedentium . Dominus antequam proponitur caro arietis in primo ipse accipit quod placet ei : & etiam si that alicui partem specialem , oportet quod accipiens comedat eam solus , & nemini licet dare ei . Si non potest totum comedere , asportat secum , vel that garcioni suo , si est presens , qui custodiat ei : since aliter , recondit in saptargat suo , hoc est in bursa quadrata , quam portant ad recondendum omnia talia , in qua & ossa recondunt , quando non habent spacium bene rodendi ea , ut postea rodant , ne pereat aliquid de cibo . 
 Quomodo faciunt Cosmos . 
 IPsum Cosmos , hoc est lac jumentinum fit hoc modo . 
 Extendunt cordam longam super terram ad duos palos fixos in terra , & ad illam cordam ligant circiter horas tres , pullos equarum quas volunt mungere . Tunc stant matres juxta pullos suos & permittunt se pacifice mungi . Et si aliqua est nimis indomita , tunc accipit unus homo pullum & supponit ei permittens parum sugere , tunc retrahit illum , & emunctor lactis succedit . Congregata ergo multitudine lactis , quod est ita dulce sicut vaccinum , dum est recens , fundunt illud in magnum utrem sive bucellam , & incipiunt illud concutere cum ligno ad hoc aptato , quod grossum est inferius sicut caput hominis & cavatum subtus : & quam cito concutiunt illud , incipit 188 
 bullire sicut vinum novum , & acescere sive fermentari , & excutiunt illud donec extrahant butirum . Tunc gustant illud ; & quando est temperate pungitivum bibunt : pungit enim super linguam sicut vinum raspei dum bibitur . Et postquam homo cessat bibere , relinquit saporem super linguam lactis amygdalini , & multum reddit interiora hominis jucunda , & etiam inebriat debilia capita : multum etiam provocat urinam . Faciunt etiam 
 Caracosmos , hoc est nigrum cosmos ad usum magnorum dominorum , hoc modo . Lac equinum non coagulatur . Ratio enim est : quod nullius animalis lac nisi cujus fetet venture non invenitur coagulum . In ventre pulli equi non invenitur : unde lac equae non coagulatur . Concutiunt ergo lac in tantum , quod omnino quod spissum est in eo vadat ad fundum recta , sicut faeces vini , & quod purum est remanet superius , & est sicut serum , & sicut mustum 
 album . Faeces sunt albae multum , & dantur servis , & faciunt multum dormire . Illud clarum bibunt domini : & 
 est pro certo valde suavis potus & bonae efficaciae . Baatu habet 30. casalia circa herbergiam suam ad unam dietam , quorum unumquodque qualibet die servit ei de tali lacte centum equarum , hoc est , qualibet die lac trium millium equarum , excepto alio lacte albo , quod deferunt alii . Sicut enim in Syria rustici daunt tertiam partem fructuum , quam ipsi afferunt ad curias dominorum suorum , ita & isti lac equarum tertiae diei . De lacte vaccino primo extrahunt butyrum & bulliunt illud usque ad perfectam decoctionem , & postea recondunt illud in utribus arietinis quos ad hoc reservant . Et non ponunt sal in butiro : tamen propter magnam decoctionem non putrescit : & reservant illud contra hyemem . Residuum lac quod remanet post butirum permittunt acescere quantum acrius fieri potest & bulliunt illud , & coagulatur bulliendo , & coagulum illud desiccant ad solemn , & efficitur durum sicut scoria ferri . Quod recondunt in saccis contra hyemem : tempore hyemali quando deficit eis lac , ponunt illud acre coagulum , quod ipsi vocant griut , in utre , & super infundunt aquam calidam , & concutiunt 189 
 fortiter donec illud resolvatur in aqua ; quae ex illo efficitur tota acetosa , & illam aquam bibunt loco lactis . Sum cavent ne bibant aquam puram . 
 De bestiis quas comedunt , & de vestibus , ac de venatione eorum . 
 MAgni domini habent casalia versus meridiem , de quibus afferunt eis milium & farinam contra hyemem . pauperes procurant sibi pro arietibus & pellibus commutando . Sclavi etiam implent ventrem suum aqua crassa , & hac contenti sunt . Mures cum longis caudis non comedunt & omne genus murium habens curtam caudam . Sunt etiam ibi multae marmotes , quas ipsi vocant Sogur : quae conveniunt in una fovea in hyeme 20. vel 30. pariter , & dormiunt sex mensibus : quas capiunt in magna multitudine . Sunt etiam ibi , cuniculi habentes longam caudam sicut cati ; & in summitate caudae habent pilos nigros & albos . Habent & multas alias bestiolas bonas ad comedendum : quas ipsi valde bene discernunt . Cervos non vidi ibi . lepores paucos vidi , gaselos multos . Asinos sylvestres vidi in magna multitudine , qui sunt quasi muli . Vidi & aliud genus animalis quod dicitur Artak , quod habet recte corpus arietis & cornua torta , sed tantae quantitatis , quod vix poteram una manu levare duo cornua : & faciunt de cornibus illis ciphos magnos . Habent falcons , gir-falcones , & herodios in magna multitudine : quos omnes portant super manum dexteram : & ponunt semper falconi unam corrigiam parvulam circa collum , quae pendet ei usque ad medietatem pectoris : per quam cum projiciunt eum ad praedam , inclinant cum sinistra manu caput & pectus falconis , ne verberetur a vento , vel ne feratur sursum . Magnum ergo partem victus sui acquirunt venatione . De vestibus & habitu eorum noveritis , quod de Cataya & aliis regionibus Orientis , & etiam de Perside & aliis regionibus austri veniunt eis panni serici & aurei , & telae de bambasio , quibus induuntur in aestate . De Russia , de Moxel , & Majore Bulgaria & Pascatir , quae est 
 190 
 major Hungaria , & Kersis : ( quae omnes sunt regiones ad Major Aquilonem & plenae sylvis ; ) & aliis multis regionibus ad Hungaria . latus aquilonare , quae eis obediunt , adducuntur eis pelles preciosae multi generis : quas nunquam vidi in partibus nostris : Quibus induuntur in hyeme . Et faciunt semper in hyeme duas pelliceas ad minus : unam , cujus pilus est ad carnem : aliam cujus pilus est extra contra ventum & nives , quae multoties sunt de pellibus lupinis vel vulpibus vel papionibus . Et dum sedent in domo habent aliam delicatiorem . Pauperes faciunt illas exteriores de canibus & capris . Quum volunt venari feras , conveniunt magna multitudo & circundant regionem in qua sciunt feras esse , & paulatim appropinquant sibi , donec concludant feras inter se quasi infra circulum , & tunc sagitant ad eas . faciunt etiam braccas de pellibus . Divites etiam furrant vestes suas de stupa setae , quae est supra modum mollis , & levis & calida . Pauperes furrant vestes de tela de bambasio , de delicatiori lana quam possunt extrahere : de grossiori faciunt filtrum ad cooperiendum domos suas & cistas , & ad lectisternia . De lana etiam & tertia parte pilorum equi admixta , faciunt cordas suas . De filtro etiam faciunt pavellas sub sellis , & capas contra pluviam . Unde mul - Nota. tum expendunt de lana . Habitum virorum vidistis . 
 De rasura virorum & ornatu mulierum . 
 Viri radunt in summitate capitis quadrangulum , & ab anterioribus angulis ducunt rasuram cristae capitis usque ad tempora . Radunt etiam tempora & collum usque ad summum concavitatis cervicis : & frontem anterius usque ad frontinellam , super quam relinquunt manipulum pilorum descendentium usque ad supercilia : In angulis occipitis relinquunt crines , quibus faciunt tricas , quas succingunt nodando usque ad aures . Et habitus puellarum non differt ab habitu virorum , nisi quod aliquantulum est longior . Said in crastino postquam est nupta radit calvariam suam a medietate capitis versus frontem , & habet tunicam latam sicut cucullam monialis , & per omnia latiorem & longiorem , fissam ante , quam 191 
 ligat sub dextro later . In hoc enim differunt Tartari i Tureis : quod Turei ligant tunicas suas ad sinistram , Tartari semper ad dextram . Postea habent ornamentum capitis , quod vocant botta , quod fit de cortice arboris vel alia materia , quam possunt invenire , leviore : & est grossum & rotundum , quantum potest duabus manibus complecti ; longum vero unius cubiti & plus , quadrum superius , sicut capitellum unius columnae . Istud botta cooperiunt panno serico precioso ; & est concavum interius : 
 [ I . 77-J & super capitellum in medio vel super quadraturam illam 
 ponunt virgulam de calamis pennarum vel cannis gracilibus longitudinis scilicet unius cubiti & plus : & illam sibi virgulam ornant superius de pennis pavonis , & per longum in circuitu pennulis caudae malardi , & etiam lapidibus praeciosis . Divites dominae istud ornamentum ponunt in summitate capitis quod stringunt fortiter cum almucia , quae foramen habet in summitate ad hoc aptatum , & in isto recondunt crines suos quos recolligunt a part posteriori ad summitatem capitis quasi in nodo uno & reponunt in illo botta , quod postea fortiter ligant sub gutture . Unde quum equitant plures dominae simul & videntur a long , apparent milites , habentes galeas in capitibus cum lanceis elevatis . Illud enim botta apparet galea de super lanceam . Et sedent omnes mulieres super equos sicut viti diversificantes coxas ; & ligant cucullas suas panno serico aerii coloris super renes , & alia fascia stringunt ad mamillas : & ligant unam peciam albam sub occulis , quae descendit usque ad pectus . Et sunt mulieres mirae pinguedinis , & quae minus habet de naso pulchrior reputatur . Deturpant etiam turpiter pinguedine fancies suas : nunquam cubant in lecto pro puerperio . 
 De officio mulierum , & operibus earum , ac de nuptiis earum . 
 OFicium fceminarum est ducere bigas , ponere domus super eas & deponere , mungere vaccas , facere butirum 
 & griut , parare pelles , & consuere eas , quas consuunt filo denervis . dividunt enim nervos in minuta fila , & postea illa 
 192 
 contorquent in unum longum filum . Consuunt etiam soculares & soccos & alias vestes . Vestes vero nunquam lavant , quia dicunt quod Deus tunc irascitur , & quod fiant tonitrua si suspendantur ad siccandum : Imo lavantes verberant & eis auferunt . Tonitrua supra modum timent : tunc omnes extraneos emittunt de domibus suis ; & involvunt see in filtris nigris , in quibus latitant , donec transierit . Nunquam etiam lavant scutellos , imo carnem cocta alveum in quo debent ponere eam lavant brodio bulliente de caldaria , & postea refundunt in caldariam , faciunt & filtrum & cooperiunt domos . Viri faciunt solum arcus & sagittas , fabricant strepas & fraena , & faciunt cellas , carpen-tant domos & bigas : custodiunt equos & mungunt equas , concutiunt ipsum cosmos & lac equinum , faciunt utres in quibus reconditur : custodiunt etiam camelos , & onerant eos . Oves & Capras custodiunt mixtim & mungunt aliquando viri , aliquando mulieres . De lacte ovium inspis - PMum sato & salso parant pelles . Cum volunt manus vel caput P0 ™ * 10-lavare implent os suum aqua & paulatim fundunt de over suo super manus , & eadem humectant crines suos , & lavant caput suum . De nuptiis eorum noveritis , quod nemo habet ibi uxorem nisi emat eam : unde aliquando sunt puellae multum adultae ante quam nubant : semper enim tenent eas parents , donec vendant eas . Servant etiam gradus consanguinitatis primum & secundum : nullum autem servant affinitatis . Habent enim simul vel successive duas sorores . Nulla vidua nubit inter eos , hac ratione ; quia credunt quod omnes qui serviunt eis in hac vita servient in futura . Unde de vidua credunt , quod semper revertitur post mortem ad primum maritum . Unde accidit turpis consuetudo inter eos quod filius scilicet ducit aliquando omnes uxores patris sui , excepta matre . Curia enim patris & matris semper accidit juniori filio . Unde oportet quod ipse provideat omnibus uxoribus patris sui , quia adveniunt eas cum curia paterna . Et tunc si vult utitur eis pro uxoribus , quia non reputat sibi injuriam , si revertatur ad patrem post mortem . Cum ergo aliquis fecerit pactum cum aliquo de filia accipienda , facit pater 
 i 193 N 
 puellae convivium , & illa fugit ad consanguineos , ut ibi lateat : Tunc pater dicit , Ecce filia mea tua est , accipe eam ubicunque inveneris : Tunc ille quaerit eam cum amicis suis , donec inveniat eam , & oportet , quod vi capiat eam , & ducat eam quasi violenter ad domum . 
 De justiciis eorum & judiciis , et de morte ac sepultura eorum . 
 DE justiciis eorum noveritis , quod quando duo homines pugnant , nemo audet se intermittere . Etiam pater non audet juvare filium . Said qui pejorem partem habet , appellat ad curiam domini . Et si alius post appellationem tangat eum , interficitur . Said oportet quod statim absque dilatione vadat : Et ille qui passus est injuriam ducit eum quasi captivum . Neminem puniunt capitali sententia , nisi deprehensus fuerit in facto , vel confessus . Said quum difia-matus est a pluribus , bene torquent eum , ut confiteatur . Homicidium puniunt capitali sententia , & etiam coitum cum non sua . Non suam dico vel uxorem vel famulam : 
 Sua enim sclava licet uti prout libet . Item enorm furtum puniunt morte . Pro levi furto , sicut pro uno ariete , dummodo non fuerit saepe deprehensus in hoc , verberant crudeliter . Et si daunt centum ictus oportet quod habeant centum baculos , de illis dico , qui verberantur sententia curiae . Item falsos nuncios , quia faciunt se nuncios & non sunt , interficiunt . Item sacrilegas , de quibus dicam vobis postea plenius , quia tales reputant veneficas . Quando aliquis moritur plangunt vehementer ululando : & tunc sunt liberi quod non daunt vectigal usque ad annum . Et si quis interest morti alicujus adulti , non ingreditur domum ipsius Mangucham usque ad annum . Si parvulus est qui moritur , non ingreditur usque post lunationem . Juxta sepulturam defuncti semper relinquunt domum unam . Si est de nobilibus , hoc est de genere Chingis , qui fuit primus pater & dominus eorum , illius qui moritur ignoratur sepultura : & semper circa loca illa ubi sepeliunt nobiles suos est una herbergia hominum custodientium sepulturas . Non intellexi quod ipsi recondunt thesaurum cum mortuis . 
 194 
 Comani faciunt magnum tumulum super defunctum & erigunt ei statuam versa fancy ad orientem , tenentem ciphum in manu sua ante umbelicum . fabricant & divitibus pyramids , id est domunculas acutas : & alicubi vidi magnas turres de tegulis coctis : alicubi lapideas domos , quamvis lapides non inveniantur ibi . Vidi quendam noviter defunctum , cui suspenderant pelles sexdecem equorum , ad quodlibet latus mundi quatuor inter perticas altas : & apposuerunt ei cosmos ut biberet , & carnes ut comederet : & tamen dicebant de illo quod fuerat baptizatus . Alias vidi sepulturas versus orientem . Areas scilicet magnas structas lapidibus , aliquas rotundas , aliquas quadratas , & postea quatuor lapides longos erectos ad quatuor regiones mundi circa aream . Et ubi aliquis infirmatur cubat in lecto & ponit signum super domum suam , quod ibi est infirmus , & quod nullus ingrediatur : unde nullus visitat infirmum nisi serviens ejus . Quando etiam aliquis de magnis curiis infirmatur , ponunt custodes long circa curiam , qui infra illos terminos neminem permittunt transire : timent enim ne mali spiritus vel ventus veniant cum ingredientibus . Ipsos divinatores vocant tanquam sacerdotes suos . 
 Qualiter ingressi sunt inter Tartaros , & de ingratitudine eorum . 
 QUando ergo ingressi sumus inter illos barbaros , visum fuit mihi , ut dixi superius , quod ingrederer aliud saeculum . Circumdederunt enim nos in equis postquam diu fecerant nos expectare sedentes in umbra sub bigis nigris . Prima quaestio fuit , utrum unquam fuissemus inter eos . habito quod non : inceperunt impudenter petere de cibariis nostris , & dedimus de pane biscocto & vino quod attuleramus nobiscum de villam : & potata una lagena vini , petierunt aliam , dicentes , quod homo non ingreditur domum uno pede , non dedimus eis , excusantes nos quod parum haberemus . Tunc quaesiverunt unde veniremus , & quo vellemus ire . dixi eis superiora verba , quod audieramus de Sartach , quod esset Christianus , & quod vellem ire ad eum , quia habebam defer ei literas vestras . Ipsi * 95 
 diligenter quaesiverunt , utrum irem de mea voluntate , vel utrum mitterer . Ego respondi quod nemo coegit me ad eundum , nec ivissem nisi voluissem : unde de mea voluntate ibam , & etiam de voluntate superioris mei . Bene cavi , quod nunquam dixi , me esse nuncium vestrum . Tunc quaesiverunt quid esset in bigis , utrum esset aurum vel argentum , vel vestes preciosae , quas deferrem Sartach . Ego respondi , quod Sartach videret quid deferremus ei , quando perveniremus ad eum ; & quod non intererat eorum ista quaerere : sed facerent me deduci usque ad capitaneum suum , & ipse si vellet mihi praebere ducatum usque ad Sartach faceret : since minus , reverterer . Erat enim in illa provincia unus consanguineus Baatu , nomine Scacatai , cui dominus imperator Constantinopolitanus mittebat literas deprecatorias , quod me permitteret transire . Tunc ipsi acquieverunt , praebentes nobis equos & boves & duos homines , qui deducerent nos . Et alii qui adduxerant nos sunt reversion . Prius tamen antequam praedicta darent , fecerunt nos diu expectare petentes de pane nostro pro parvulis suis : Et omnia quae videbant super famulos nostros , cultellos , chirothecas , bursas , corrigias , omnia admirantes & volentes habere . Excusabam me , quia longam nobis restabat via , nec debebamus ita cito spoliare nos rebus necessariis ad tantam viam perficiendam . Tunc dicebant quod essem batrator . Verum est quod nihil abstulerint vi : Said valde importune & impudenter petunt quae vident . Et si that homo eis perdit , quia sunt ingrati . Reputant se dominos mundi , & videtur eis , quod nihil debeat eis negari ab aliquo . Si non that , & postea indigeat servicio eorum , male ministrant ei . Dederunt nobis bibere de lacte suo vaccino , a quo contractum erat butirum , acetoso valde , quod ipsi vocant Apram : & sic recessimus ab eis . Et visum fuit mihi recte , quod evasissem de manibus daemonum . In crastino pervenimus ad capitaneum . Ex quo recessimus a Soldaia usque ad Sartach in duobus mensibus nunquam jacuimus in domo nec in 
 tentorio , sed semper sub dio , vel sub bigis nostris , nec vidimus aliquam villam , vel vestigium alicujus aedificii ubi 
 196 
 1253-fuisset villam , nisi tumbas Comanorum in maxima multitudine . Illo sero dedit nobis garcio qui ducebat nos bibere cosmos ; ad cujus haustum totus sudavi propter horrorem & novitatem , quia nunquam biberam de eo . valde tamen sapidum videbatur mihi , sicut vere est . 
 De curia Scacatay , & quod Christiani non bibunt cosmos . 
 MAne ergo obviavimus bigis Scacatay onustis domibus . 
 Et videbatur mihi quod obviaret mihi civitas magna . Mirabar etiam super multitudine armentorum boum & equorum & gregum ovium : paucos videbam homines qui ista gubernarent , unde inquisivi quot homines haberet sub se ? & dictum fuit mihi , quod non plusquam quingentos , quorum medietatem transiveramus in alia herbergia . Tunc incepit mihi dicere garcio qui ducebat nos , quod aliquid oporteret Scacatay dare : & ipse fecit nos stare , & praecessit nuncians adventum nostrum . Jam erat hora plusquam tertia , & deposuerunt domos suas juxta quandam aquam . Et venit ad nos interpres ipsius , qui statim cognito , quod nunquam fueramus inter illos , poposcit de cibis nostris , & dedimus ei , poscebat etiam vestimentum aliquod , quia dicturus erat verbum nostrum ante dominum suum . Excusavimus nos . Quaesivit quid portaremus domino suo ? Accepimus unum flasconem de vino , & implevimus unum veringal de biscocto & platellum unum de pomis & aliis fructibus . Said non placebat ei , quia non ferebamus aliquem pannum pretiosum . Sic tamen ingressi sumus cum timore & verecundiam . Sedebat ipse in lecto suo tenens citharulam in manu , & uxor sua juxta eum : de qua credebam in veritate , quod amputasset sibi nasum inter oculos ut simior esset : nihil enim habebat ibi de naso , & unxerat locum illum quodam unguento nigro , & etiam supercilia : quod erat turpissimum in oculis nostris . Tunc dixi ei verba supradicta . Ubique enim oportebat nos dicere idem verbum . Super hoc enim eramus bene prae - Nota moniti ab illis qui fuerant inter illos , quod nunquam diligenter . mutaremus verba nostra . Rogavi etiam eum ut dignaretur 
 197 
 accipere munusculum de manu nostra , excusans me , quia monachus eram , nec erat ordinis nostri possidere aurum , vel argentum , vel vestes preciosas . Unde non habebam aliquid talium , quod possem ei dare : sed de cibis nostris acciperet pro benediction . Tunc fecit recipi , & distribuit statim hominibus suis qui convenerant ad potandum . Dedi etiam ei literas Imperatoris Constantinopolitani : ( Hoc fuit in octavis ascensionis ) Qui statim eas Soldaiam misit ut ibi interpretarentur : quia erant in Graeco , nec habebat secum qui sciret literas Graecas . Quaesivit etiam a nobis , si vellemus bibere cosmos , hoc est , lac jumentinum . Christiani enim Ruteni , Graeci , & Alani , qui sunt inter eos , qui volunt strict custodire legem suam , non bibunt illud : Imo non reputant se Christianos postquam biberunt . Et sacerdotes eorum reconciliant eos , tanquam negassent fidem Christianam . Ego respondi , quod habebamus adhuc sufficienter ad bibendum : & cum ille potus deficeret nobis , oporteret nos bibere illud , quod daretur nobis . Quaesivit etiam quid contineretur in literis nostris , quas mittebatis Sartach . Dixi quod clausae erant bullae nostrae : & quod non erant in eis nisi bona verba & amica-bilia . Quaesivit & quae verba diceremus Sartach ? Respondi , Verba fidei Christianae . Quaesivit quae ? Quia libenter vellet audire . Tunc exposui ei prout potui per interpretem meum , qui nullius erat ingenii , nec alicujus eloquentiae , symbolum fidei . Quo audito , ipse tacuit & movit caput . Tunc assignavit nobis duos homines , qui 
 nos custodirent , & equos & boves : & fecit nos bigare 
 secum , donec reverteretur nuncius , quem ipse miserat pro interpretation literarum imperatoris ; & ivimus cum eo usque in crastinum Pentecostes . 
 Qualiter Alani venerunt ad eos in vigilia Pentecostes .

 tione personarum venerantur omnem Christianum : & detulerunt nobis carnes coctas , rogantes ut comederemus de cibo eorum , & oraremus pro quodam defuncto eorum . Tunc dixi quod vigilia erat tantae solennitatis , quod illa die non comederemus carnes . Et exposui eis de solennitate , super quo fuerunt multum gavisi ; quia omnia ignorabant quae spectant ad ritum Christianum , solo nomine Christi excepto . Quaesiverunt & ipsi & alii multi Christiani , Ruteni & Hungari , utrum possent salvari , quia oportebat eos bibere cosmos , & comedere morticinia & interfecta A Saracenis & aliis infidelibus : quae etiam ipsi Graeci & Ruteni sacerdotes reputant quasi morticinia vel idolis immolata : quia ignorabant tempora jejunii : nec poterant custodire etiam si cognovissent . Tunc rectificabar eos prout potui , docens & confortans in fide . Carnes quas detulerant reservavimus usque ad diem festum : nihil enim inveniebamus venal pro auro & argento , nisi pro telis & aliis II pannis : & illos non habebamus . Quum | | Nota famuli nostri offerebant eis ipperpera , ipsi fricabant digitis , ^Rgentisslme . & ponebant ad nares , ut odore sentirent , utrum essent cuprum . Nec dabant nobis cibum nisi lac vaccinum acre valde & foetidum . Vinum jam deficiebat nobis . Aqua ita turbabatur ab equis , quod non erat potabilis . Nisi fuisset biscoctum quod habebamus , & gratia dei , forte fuissemus mortui . 
 De Saraceno qui dixit se velle baptizari , et de hominibus qui apparent leprosi . 
 IN die pentecosts venit ad nos quidam Saracenus , qui cum loqueretur nobiscum , incepimus exponere fidem . 
 Qui audiens beneficia dei exhibita humano generi in incarnation Christi , & resurrectionem mortuorum , & judicium futurum , & quod ablutio peccatorum esset in baptismo : dixit se velle baptizari . Et cum pararemus nos ad baptizandum eum , ipse subito ascendit equum suum , dicens se iturum domum & habiturum consilium cum uxore sua . Qui in crastino loquens nobiscum , dixit quod nullo modo auderet accipere baptisma , quia 199 
 tunc non biberet cosmos . Christiani enim illius loci hoc dicebant , quod nullus verus Christianus deberet bibere : & sine potu illo non posset vivere in solitudine illa . A qua opinion nullo modo potui divertere illum . Unde noveritis pro certo quod multum elongantur a fide propter illam opinionem quae jam viguit inter illos per Rutenos , quorum maxima multitudo est inter eos . Illa die dedit nobis ille capitaneus unum hominem , qui nos deduceret usque ad Sartach : & duos qui ducerent nos usque ad proximam herbergiam ; quae inde distabat quinque dietas prout boves poterant ire . Dederunt etiam nobis unam capram pro cibo & plures utres lactis vaccini , & de cosmos parum : quia illud preciosum est inter illos . Et sic arripientes iter recte in aquilonem , visum fiiit mihi quod unam portam inferni transissemus . Garciones qui ducebant nos , incipiebant nobis audacter furari , quia videbant nos parum cautos . Tandem amissis pluribus vexatio dabat nobis intellectum . Pervenimus tandem ad extremitatem illius provinciae , quae clauditur uno fossato ab uno mari usque ad aliud : extra quam erat herbergia eorum apud quos intrassemus : videbantur nobis leprosi omnes : quia erant viles homines ibi collocati , ut reciperent Salina : . tributum ab accipientibus sal a salinis superius dictis . Ab illo loco , ut dicebant , oportebat nos ambulare quindecim diebus , quibus non inveniremus populum . Cum illis bibimus cosmos : & dedimus illis unum veringal plenum fructibus & panem biscoctum . Qui dederunt nobis octo boves , unam capram pro tanto itinere , & nescio quot Decem dieta . utres plenos lacte vaccino . Sic mutatis bobus arripuimus iter , quod perfecimus decem diebus usque ad aliam herbergiam : nec invenimus aquam in illa via nisi in fossis in convallibus factis , exceptis duobus parvis fluminibus . Et tendebamus recte in orientem ex quo exivimus praedictam provinciam Gasariae , habentes mare ad meridiem & vastam solitudinem ad aquilonem : quae durat per viginti dietas alicubi in latitudine : In qua nulla est sylva , nullus mons , nullus lapis . Herba est optima . In hac solebant pascere Comani , qui dicuntur Capchat . A Teutonicis 
 200 
 vero dicuntur Valani , & provincia Valania . Ab Isidoro vero dicitur a flumine Tanai usque ad paludes Meotidis 
 & Danubium Alania . Et durat ista terra in longitudine a Comania lon-Danubio usque Tanaim ; qui est terminus Asiae & tudo-europae , itinere duorum mensium velociter equitando prout equitant Tartari : Quae tota inhabitabatur i Comanis Capchat , & etiam ultra a Tanai usque | | Etiliam : Inter ^Etiha qua quae flumina sunt decem dietae magnae . Ad aquilonem verb istius provinciae jacet Russia , quae ubique sylvas habet , & protenditur a Polonia & Hungaria usque Tanaim : quae tota vastata est a Tartaris , & adhuc quotidie vastatur . Praeponunt enim Rutenis , quia sunt Christiani , Saracenos : & cum non possunt amplius dare aurum vel argentum , ducunt eos & parvulos eorum tanquam greges ad solitudinem ut custodiant animalia eorum . Ultra Russiam ad aquilonem est Prussia , quam Prussia . nuper subjugaverunt totam fratres Teutonici . Et certain de facili acquierent Russiam , si apponerent manum . Si enim Tartari audirent , quod magnus sacerdos , hoc est , Papa faceret cruce signari contra eos , omnes fugerent ad solitudines suas . 
 De tediis quae patiebantur , & de sepultura Comanorum . 
 IBamus ergo versus orientem , nihil videntes nisi coelum & terram , & aliquando mare ad dextram , quod dicitur Mare Tanais , & etiam sepulturas Comanorum , quae apparebant nobis a duabus leucis secundum quod [ I-solebant parentelae eorum sepeliri simul . Quam diu eramus in solitudine bene erat nobis : quod taedium quod patiebar quum veniebamus ad mansiones eorum non possem exprimere verbis . Volebat enim dux noster , quod ad quoslibet capitaneos ingrederer cum xenio : & ad hoc non sufficiebant expensae . Quotidie enim eramus octo personae comedentes viaticum nostrum exceptis servientibus , qui omnes volebant comedere nobiscum . Nos enim eramus quinque , & ipsi tres qui ducebant nos : duo ducentes bigas , & unus iturus nobiscum usque ad 
 201 
 Casale Rutenorum . 
 Sartach . Carnes quas dabant non sufficiebant ; nec inveniebamus aliquid venal pro moneta . Et cum sedebamus sub bigis nostris pro umbra , quia calor erat ibi maximus illo tempore , ipsi ita importune ingerebant se nobis , quod conculcabant nos , volentes omnia nostra videre . Si arripiebat eos appetitus purgandi ventrem , non elongabant se a nobis , quam possit faba jactari . Imo juxta nos colloquentes mutuo faciebant immunditias suas : & multa alia faciebant quae erant supra modum taediosa . Super omnia gravabat me , quod cum volebam dicere eis aliquod verbum aedificationis , interpres meus dicebat , non facietis me praedicare : quia nescio talia verba dicere . Et verum dicebat . Ego enim perpendi postea , quum incepi aliquantulum intelligere idioma , quod quum dicebam unum , ipse totum aliud dicebat , secundum quod ei occurrebat . Tunc videns periculum loquendi per ipsum , elegi magis tacere . Ambulavimus ergo cum magno labour de mansion in mansionem : ita quod paucis diebus ante festum beatae Mariae Magdalenae veni ad fluvium magnum Tanais : qui dividit Asiam ab Europa , sicut Nilus fluvius TEgypti , Asiam ab Africa . In illo loco quo applicuimus fecerunt Baatu & Sartach fieri quoddam casale de Rutenis in ripa orientali , qui transferunt nuncios & mercatores cum naviculis . Ipsi transtulerunt nos primo & postea bigas ponentes unam rotam in una barca & aliam in alia , ligantes barcas ad invicem ; & sic remigantes transibant . Ibi egit dux noster valde stulte . Ipse enim credebat , quod illi de casali deberent nobis ministrare equos , & dimisit animalia quae adduxeramus in alia biga , ut redirent ad dominos suos . Et quum postulavimus ab eis animalia , ipsi respondebant quod habebant privilegium a Baatu , quod non tenerentur ad aliud , nisi transfer euntes & redeuntes : etiam a mercatoribus accipiebant magnum tributum . Stetimus ergo ibi in ripa fluminis tribus diebus . Prima die dederunt nobis magnam borbatam recentem : secunda die panem de siligine & parum de carnibus , quas acceperat procurator villae ostiatim per 
 202 
 1253-diversas domos . Tertia die pisces siccos , quos habent ibi in magna multitudine . Fluvius ille erat ibi tantae Latitudo latitudinis , quantae est Sequana Parisiis . Et antequam Tana , s-pervenissemus ad locum illum , transivimus multas aquas pulcherrimas & piscosissimas : said Tartari nesciunt eos capere : nec curant de pisce nisi sit ita magnus , quod possunt comedere carnes ejus , sicut carnes arietinas . Ille fluvius est terminus Orientalis Russiae ; & oritur de paludibus quae pertingunt ad Oceanum ad aquilonem . Oceanus . Fluvius vero currit ad meridiem in quoddam magnum Mare septingentorum millium , antequam pertingat ad Mare Ponti : Et omnes aquae quas transivimus vadunt ad illas parts . Habet etiam praedictum flumen magnam sylvam in ripa Occidentali . Ultra locum illum non ascendunt Tartari versus Aquilonem : quia tunc temporis 
 II circa introitum Augusti incipiunt redire versus meri - W^dintnitum diem . Unde aliud est casale inferius ubi transeunt ’e~ nuncn tempore hyemali . Eramus igitur ibi in magna meridiem . angustia , quia nec equos nec boves inveniebamus pro pecunia . Tandem postquam ostendi eis , quod laboravi pro communi utilitate omnium Christianorum , accommodaverunt nobis boves & homines : nos autem oportebat ire pedibus . Tunc temporis metebant siliginem : triticum non proficiebat ibi bene . Milium habent in magna copia . Mulieres Rutenae ornant capita sicut nostrae . Supertunicalia sua exterius ornant vario vel grisio a pedibus usque ad genua . Homines portant capas sicut Teutonici : said in capite portant pileos de filtro acutos in summitate longo acumine . Ambulavimus ergo tribus diebus non invenientes populum . Et cum essemus valde fatigati & boves similiter , nec sciremus quorsum possemus Tartaros invenire , accurrerunt subito duo equi , quos recepimus cum gaudio magno , & ascenderunt eos dux noster & interpres , ut specularentur quorsum possemus populum invenire . Tandem quarta die inventis hominibus gavisi sumus tanquam naufragi venientes ad portum . Tunc acceptis equis & bobus ivimus de mansion ad mansionem donec per -

 | | Reditus ejus per Derbent . 
 venimus usque ad herbergiam Sartach secundo Calendas Augusti . 
 De region Sartach , & de gentibus illius . 
 REgio ista ultra Tanaim est pulcherrima , habens flumina & sylvas ad aquilonem . Sunt sylvae maximae , quas inhabitant duo genera hominum : Moxel scilicet , qui sunt sine lege , puri pagani . Civitatem non habent sed casulas in sylvis . Dominus eorum & magna pars eorum fuerunt interfecti in Alemania . Tartari enim duxerant eos ad introitum Alemaniae . Unde ipsi multum commendant Alemanos , sperantes quod adhuc liberabuntur per eos a servitute Tartarorum . Si mercator veniat ad eos , oportet quod ille apud quem primo descendit provideat ei quamdiu vult esse inter eos . Si quis dormiat cum uxore alterius , ille non curate nisi videat propriis oculis : unde non sunt Zelotypi . Abundant apud eos porci , mei , & cera , pelles preciosae , & falcons . Post illos sunt alii qui dicuntur Merdas , quos latini vocant Merduos , & sunt Saraceni . Post illos est II Etilia , quae est major fluvius , quam unquam viderim : & venit ab Aquilone de majori Bulgaria tendens ad meridiem : & cadit in quen-dam lacum habentem spacium quatuor mensium in circuitu , de quo postea dicam vobis . Ista ergo duo flumina Tanais & Etilia versus regiones Aquilonis per quas transivimus non distant ab invicem nisi decem dietis , sed ad meridiem multum dividuntur ab invicem . Tanais enim descendit in Mare Ponti : Etilia facit praedictum Mare sive lacum , cum aliis multis fluminibus , quae cadunt in illum de Perside . Habebamus autem ad meridiem montes maximos in quibus habitant in lateribus versus solitudinem illam Cergis & Alani sive | | Aeas , qui sunt Christiani & adhuc pugnant contra Tartaros . Post istos prope Mare sive lacum Etiliae sunt quidam Saraceni qui dicuntur Lesgi , qui similiter obediunt . Post hos est Porta ferrea , quam fecit Alexander ad excludendas Barbaras gentes de Perside : de cujus situ dicam vobis postea , II quia transivi per eam in reditu . Et inter ista duo flumina in illis 
 204 
 terris per quas transivimus habitabant Comani antequam Tartari occuparent eas . 
 De Curia Sartach & de gloria ejus . 
 INvenimus ergo Sartach prope Etiliam per tres dietas : cujus curia valde magna videbatur nobis : quia habet sex uxores , & filius ejus primogenitus juxta eum duas vel tres : & quaelibet habet domum magnam & bigas forte ducentas . Accessit autem ductor noster ad quendam Nestorinum Coiat nomine , qui est unus de majoribus Coiat Nestori-Curiae suae . Ille fecit nos ire valde long and domini nus ' Januam . Ita vocant illum qui habet officium recipiendi nuncios . In sero praecepit nobis dictus Coiat , ut 
 veniremus ad eum . Tunc incepit quaerere ductor noster quid portaremus ei , & coepit multum scandalizari , quum vidit quod nihil parabamus ad portandum . Stetimus coram eo , & ipse sedebat in gloria sua & faciebat sonare citharam & saltare coram se . Tunc dixi ei verba praedicta qualiter veniremus ad dominum ejus , rogans eum ut juvaret nos ut Dominus ejus videret literas nostras . Excusavi etiam me quia monachus eram , non habens , nec recipiens , nec tractans aurum vel argentum vel aliquid preciosum , solis libris & capella in qua serviebamus deo exceptis : unde nullum xenium afferebamus ei nec domino suo . Qui enim propria dimiseram , non poteram portator esse alienorum . Tunc respondit satis mansuete , quod bene faciebam ex quo eram monachus : sic servarem votum meum , & non indigebat rebus nostris ; sed magis dart nobis de suis , si indigeremus : & fecit nos sedere & bibere de lacte suo . Et post pauca rogavit ut diceremus benedictionem pro eo , quod & fecimus . Quaesivit & quis esset major dominus inter Francos . Dixi , Imperator , si haberet terram suam in pace . Non , inquit , sed Rex Franciae . Audiverat enim de vobis A domino Baldewyno de Hannonia . Inveni etiam ibi unum de Sociis domus Dominicae , qui fuerat in Cypro , qui narraverat omnia quae viderat . Tunc reversion sumus ad hospitium nostrum . In crastino misi 
 205 
 ei unum flasconem de vino Muscato , quod optime se custodierat in tam longam via ; & cophinum plenum biscocto quod fuit ei gratissimum , & retinuit illo sero famulos nostros secum . In crastino mandavit mihi quod venirem ad curiam ; afferens literas regis & capellam & libros mecum , quia dominus suus vellet videre ea : quod & fecimus , onerantes unam bigam libris & capella , & aliam pane & vino & fructibus . Tunc fecit omnes libros & vestes explicari , & circumstabant nos in equis multi Tartari & Christiani & Saraceni : quibus inspectis , quaesivit , si vellem ista omnia dare domino suo , quo audito , expavi , & displicuit mihi verbum , dissimulans tamen respondi , domine rogamus , quatenus dominus noster dignetur recipere panem istum , vinum & fructus non pro xenio quia exiguum quid est , sed pro benediction , ne vacua manu veniamus coram eo . Ipse autem videbit literas domini regis , & per eas sciet , qua de causa venimus ad eum : & tunc stabimus mandato ejus nos & omnes res nostrae . Vestes enim sanctae sunt , & non licet eas contingere nisi sacerdotibus . Tunc praecepit quod indueremus nos ituri coram domino suo : quod & fecimus . Ego autem indutus preciosioribus vestibus accepi in pectore pulvinar , quod erat valde pulchrum , & biblium quod dederatis mihi , psalterium pulcherrimum , quod dederat mihi domina regina , in quo erant picturae pulchrae . Socius meus accepit missale & crucem , clericus indutus supercilicio accepit thuribulum : sic accessimus ante dominum ejus : & levaverunt filtrum quod pendebat ante ostium ut nos posset videre . 
 Tunc fecerunt flectere genua ter clerico & interpreti : a nobis non requisiverunt . Tunc monuerunt nos valde diligenter , ut caveremus ingrediendo & egrediendo ne tangeremus limen domus , & ut cantaremus aliquam benedictionem pro eo . Tunc ingressi sumus cantando , Salve regina . In introitu autem ostii stabat bancus cum cosmos & cum ciphis . Et convenerant omnes uxores ejus : & ipsi Moal . Ingredientes nobiscum comprimebant nos . Illic Coiac tulit ei thuribulum cum 206 
 incenso , quod ipse respexit , tenens in manu diligenter : postea tulit ei psalterium quod valde respexit , & uxor ejus sedens juxta eum . Postea tulit biblium , & ipse quaesivit , si evangelium esset ibi . Dixi , etiam tota Scriptura Sacra . Accepit etiam crucem in manu sua , & quaesivit de imagine , utrum esset imago Christi ? Respondi quod sic . Ipsi Nestoriani & Armeni nunquam faciunt super cruces suas figuram Christi . Unde videntur male sentire de passion , vel erubescunt eam . Postea fecit circumstantes nos retrahere se , ut plenius posset videre ornamenta nostra . Tunc obtuli ei literas vestras cum transcriptis in Arabico & Syriano . Feceram enim eas transferri in Aeon in utraque litera & lingua . Et ibi erant sacerdotes Armeni , qui sciebant Turcicum & Arabicum , & Ille Socius domus Domini qui sciebat Syrianum , & Turcicum & Arabicum . Tunc exivimus & deposuimus vestimenta nostra : & venerunt scriptores & ille Coiac , & fecerunt literas interpretari . Quibus auditis , fecit recipi panem & vinum & fructus : vestimenta & libros fecit nos reportare ad hospitium . Hoc actum est in festo Sancti Petri ad vincula . 
 Qualiter habuerunt in mandatis adire Baatu patrem Sartach . 
 IN crastino mane venit quidam sacerdos frater ipsius Coiac postulans vasculum cum chrismate , quia Sartach volebat illud videre , ut dicebat , & dedimus ei . Hora vespertina vocavit nos Coiac , dicens nobis : Dominus rex scripsit bona verba Domino meo : said sunt in eis difficilia , de quibus nihil auderet facere , sine consilio patris sui . Unde oportet vos ire ad patrem suum , & duas bigas quas adduxistis heri cum vestimentis & libris dimittetis mihi , quia Dominus meus vult res diligentius videre . Ego statim suspicatus sum malum de cupiditate ejus , & dixi ei . Domine , non solum illas sed etiam duas quas adhuc habemus relinquemus sub custodia vestra . Non inquit , illas relinquetis , de aliis facietis velle vestrum . Dixi quod hoc nullo modo posset fieri . Said totam dimitteremus ei . 
 207 
 Tunc quaesivit si vellemus morari in terra ? Ego dixi , Si bene intellexistis literas domini regis , potestis scire , quod sic . Tunc dixit , quod oporteret nos esse patientes multum , & humiles . Sic discessimus ab eo illo sero . In crastino mane misit unum sacerdotem Nestorinum pro bigis , & nos duximus omnes quatuor . Tunc occurrens nobis frater ipsius Coiacis , seperavit omnia nostra ab ipsis rebus quas tuleramus pridie ad curiam , & illa accepit tanquam sua , scilicet libros & vestimenta : & Coiac praeceperat , quod ferremus nobiscum vestimenta quibus induti fueramus coram Sartach ut illis indueremur coram Baatu si expediret : quas ille sacerdos abstulit nobisvi , dicens : Tu attulisti eas ad Sartach , modo vis far Baatu ? Et cum vellem ei reddere rationem , respondit mihi , Ne loquaris nimis , & vade viam tuam . Tunc necessaria fuit patientia , quia apud Sartach , non patebat nobis ingressus ; nec aliquis erat , qui nobis exhiberet justiciam . Timebam etiam de interpret , ne ipse aliquid aliter dixisset , quam ego dixissem ei : quia ipse bene voluisset , quod de omnibus fecissemus xenium . Unum erat mihi solacium , quia quum persensi cupiditatem eorum , ego subtraxi de libris Biblium & sententias , & alios libros quos magis diligebam . Psalterium dominae reginae non fui ausus subtrahere , quia illud fuerat nimis notatum propter aureas picturas quae erant in eo . Sic ergo reversion sumus cum duobus residuis bigis ad hospitium nostrum . Tunc venit ille , qui debebat ducere nos ad Baatu , volens cum festinatione arripere iter : cui dixi quod nulla ratione ducerem bigas . Quod ipse retulit ad Coiac . Tunc praecepit Coiac quod relinqueremus eas apud ipsum cum garcione nostro : quod & fecimus . Sic ergo euntes versus Baatu recta in Orientem , tertia die pervenimus ad Etiliam : cujus aquas cum vidi , mirabar unde ab Aquilone descenderunt tantae aquae . Antequam recederemus a Sartach , dixit nobis supradictus Coiac cum aliis multis scriptoribus curiae , Nolite dicere quod dominus noster sit Christianus , said Moal . Quia nomen Christianitatis videtur eis nomen cujusdam gentis . In tantam superbiam sunt erecti , quod quamvis aliquid forte credant 
 208 
 de Christo , tamen nolunt dici Christiani volentes nomen suum , hoc est , Moal exaltare super omne nomen . Nec volunt vocari Tartari : Tartari enim fuerunt alia gens de quibus sic didici . 
 Qualiter Sartach , & Mangucham & Kencham faciunt reverentiam Christianis . 
 TEmpore quo Franci ceperunt Antiochiam tenebat monarchiam in illis lateribus Aquilonis quidam qui vocabatur Concan . Con est proprium nomen : Can nomen dignitatis quod idem est qui divinator . Omnes divinatores vocant Can . Unde principes dicuntur Can , quia penes eos spectat regimen populi per divinationem . Unde legitur in historia Antiochiae , quod Turei miserunt propter succursum contra Francos ad regnum Con can . De illis enim partibus venerunt omnes Turei . Iste Con erat Caracatay . Cara idem est quod nigrum . Catai nomen gentis . Unde Caracatay idem est quod nigri Catay . Et hoc dicitur ad differentiam ipsorum Catay qui erant in Oriente super Oceanum de quibus postea dicam vobis . Isti Catay erant in quibusdam alpibus per quas transivi . Et in quadam planicie inter illas Alpes erat quidam Nestorinus pastor potens & dominus super populum , qui dicebatur Yayman , qui erant Christiani Nestorini . Mortuo Con can elevavit se ille Nestorius in regem , & vocabant eum Nestoriani Regem Johannem : & plus dicebant de ipso in decuplo quam veritas esset . Ita enim faciunt Nestoriani venientes de partibus illis . De nihilo enim faciunt magnos rumores . Unde disseminaverunt de Sartach quod esset Christianus , & de Mangu Can & Ken can : quia faciunt majorem reverentiam Christianis , quam aliis populis , & tamen in veritate Christiani non sunt . Sic ergo exivit magna fama de illo Rege Johanne . Et quando ego transivi per pascua ejus , nullus aliquid sciebat de eo nisi Nestoriani pauci . In pascuis ejus habitat Kencam , apud cujus curiam fuit frater Andreas : & ego etiam transivi per eam in reditu . Huic Johanni erat frater quidam potens , pastor similiter , nomine Vut : & i 209 oh

 ipse erat ultra Alpes ipsorum Caracatay , distans a fratre suo spacium trium hebdomadarum & erat dominus cujus-dam Villulas quae dicitur Caracarum , populum habens sub se , qui dicebantur Crit , Merkit , qui erant Christiani Nestorini . Said ipse dominus eorum dimisso cultu Christi , sectabatur idola ; habens sacerdotes idolorum , qui omnes sunt invocatores daemonum & sortilegi . Ultra pascua istius ad decem vel quindecem dietas erant pascua Moal : qui erant pauperrimi homines sine capitaneo & sine lege , exceptis sortilegiis & divinationibus , quibus omnes in partibus illis intendunt . Et juxta Moal erant alii pauperes , qui dicebantur Tartari . Rex Johannes mortuus fuit sine haerede , & ditatus est frater ejus Unc ; & faciebat se vocari Can : & mittebantur armenta greges ejus usque ad terminos Moal . Tunc temporis Chingis faber quidam erat in populo Moal : & furabatur de animalibus Unc can quod poterat : In tantum quod conquesti sunt pastors Vut domino suo . Tunc congregavit exercitum & equitavit in terram Moal , quaerens ipsum Cyngis . Et ille fugit inter Tartaros & latuit ibi . Tunc ipse Vut accepta praeda Moal & a Tartaris reversus est . Tunc ipse Cyngis allocutus est Tartaros & ipsos Moal dicens , Quia sine duce sumus opprimunt nos vicini nostri . Et fecerunt ipsum ducem & capitaneum Tartari & Moal . Tunc latenter congregato exercitu irruit super ipsum Vut , & vicit ipsum , & ipse fugit in Cathaiam . Ibi capta fuit filia ejus , quam Cyngis dedit uni ex filiis in uxorem , ex quo ipsa suscepit istum qui nunc regnat Mangu . Tunc ipse Cyngis premittebat ubique ipsos Tartaros : & inde exivit nomen eorum , quia ubique clamabatur , Ecce Tartari veniunt . Said per crebra bella modo omnes fere deleti sunt . Unde isti Moal modo volunt extinguere illud nomen , & suum elevare . Terra illa in qua primo fuerunt , & ubi est adhuc curia Cyngiscan , vocatur Mancherule . Said quia Tartari est regio circa quam fuit acquisitio eorum , illam civitatem habent pro regali , & ibi prope eligunt suum Can .

 De Rutenis & Hungaris , & Alanis , & de mari Caspio . 
 DE Sartach autem utrum credit in Christum vel non nescio . Hoc scio quod Christianus non vult dici . 
 Immo magis videtur mihi deridere Christianos . Ipse enim est in itinere Christianorum , scilicet Rutenorum , Blacorum , Bulgarorum minoris Bulgaria , Soldainorum , Kerkisorum , Alanorum : qui omnes transeunt per eum quum vadunt ad curiam patris sui defer ei munera , unde magis amplectitur eos . Tamen si Saraceni veniant , & majus afferant , citius expediuntur . Habet etiam circa se Nestorinos sacerdotes , qui pulsant tabulam , & cantant officium suum . 
 Est alius qui dicitur Berta super Baatu , qui pascit Berta vel versus Portam ferream , ubi est iter Saracenorum omnium Berca . qui veniunt de Perside & de Turchia , qui euntes ad Baatu , & transeuntes per eum , deferunt ei munera . Et ille facit se Saracenum , & non permittit in terra sua comedi carnes porcinas . Baatu in reditu nostro praeceperat ei , quod transferret se de illo loco ultra Etiliam ad Orientem , nolens nuncios Saracenorum transire per eum , quia videbatur sibi damnosum . 
 Quatuor autem diebus quibus fuimus in curia Sartach , nunquam provisum fuit nobis de cibo , nisi semel de modico cosmos . In via vero inter ipsum & patrem suum habuimus magnum timorem . Ruteni enim & Hungari , & Alani servi eorum , quorum est magna multitudo inter eos , associant se viginti vel triginta simul , & fugiunt de nocte , habentes pharetras & arcus , & quemcunque inveniunt de nocte interficiunt , de die latitantes . Et quando sunt equi eorum fatigati veniunt de nocte ad multitudinem equorum in pascuis , & mutant equos , & unum vel duos ducunt secum , ut comedant quum indiguerint . Occursum ergo talium timebat multum Dux noster . In illa via fuissemus mortui fame , si non portavissemus nobiscum modicum de biscocto . 
 Venimus tandem ad Etiliam maximum flumen . Est

 enim in quadruplo majus quam Sequana , & profundissimum : Veniens de majori Bulgaria , quae est ad Aquilonem , tendens in quendam lacum , sive quoddam mare , quod modo vocant mare Sircan , a quadam civitate , quae est juxta ripam ejus in Perside . Said Isidorus vocat illud mare Caspium . Habet enim montes Caspios , & Persidem a meridie : montes vero Musihet , hoc est , Assassi-norum ad Orientem , qui contiguantur cum montibus Caspiis : Ad Aquilonem vero habet illam solitudinem , in qua modo sunt Tartari . Prius vero erant ibi quidam qui dicebantur Canglae : Et ex illo later recipit Etiliam , qui crescit in aestate sicut Nilus TEgypti . Ad Occidentem vero habet montes Alanorum & Lesgi ; & Portam feream , & montes Georgianorum . Habet igitur illud mare tria latera inter montes , Aquilonare vero habet ad planiciem . Frater Andreas ipse circumdedit duo latera ejus , meridional scilicet & Orientale . Ego vero alia duo ; Aquilonare scilicet in eundo a Baatu ad Mangu cham , Occidental vero in revertendo de Baatu in Syriam . Quatuor mensibus potest circumdari . Et non est verum quod dicit Isidorus , quod sit sinus exiens ab Oceano : nusquam enim tangit Oceanum , sed undique circumdatur terra . 
 De curia Baatu , & qualiter recepti fuerunt ab eo . 
 TOta illa regio a later Occidentali istius maris , ubi sunt Porta ferrea Alexandri , & montes Alanorum , usque ad Oceanum Aquilonarem & paludes Maeotidis ubi mergitur Tanais , solebat dici Albania : de qua dicit Isidorus , quod habet canes ita magnos , tantaeque feritatis , ut tauros premant , leones perimant . Quod verum est , prout intellexi a narrantibus , quod ibi versus Oceanum Aquilonarem faciunt canes trahere in bigis sicut boves propter magnitudinem & fortitudinem eorum . In illo ergo loco ubi nos applicuimus super Etiliam est casale novum , quod fecerunt Tartari de Rutenis mixtim , qui transponunt nuncios euntes , & redeuntes ad curiam Baatu : 
 212 
 quia Baatu est in ulteriori ripa versus Orientem : nec transit ilium locum ubi nos applicuimus ascendendo in aestate , sed jam incipiebat descendere . De Januario enim usque ad Augustum ascendit ipse , & omnes alii versus frigidas regiones , & in Augusto incipiunt redire . Descendimus ergo in navi ab illo casali usque ad curiam ejus . Et ab illo loco usque ad villas majoris Bulgariae versus Aquilonem , sunt quinque dietae . Et miror quis Diabolus portavit illuc legem Machometi . A Porta enim ferrea , quae est exitus Persidis , sunt plusquam triginta dietae per transversum , solitudinem ascendendo juxta Etiliam usque in illam Bulgariam , ubi nulla est civitas , nisi quaedam casalia prope ubi cadit Etilia in mare . Et illi Bulgari sunt pessimi Saraceni , fortius tenentes legem Machometi , quam aliqui alii . Quum ergo vidi curiam Baatu , expavi ; quia videbantur prope domus ejus , quasi quaedam magna civitas protensa in longum , & populus undique circumfusus , usque ad tres vel quatuor leucas . Et sicut populus Israel sciebat unusquisque , ad quam regionem tabernaculi deberet figere tentoria : ita ipsi sciunt ad quod latus curiae debeant se collocare , quando ipsi deponunt domus . Unde dicitur curia Orda lingua eorum , quod sonat medium , quia semper est in medio hominum suorum : hoc excepto , quod recta ad meridiem nullus se collocat , quia ad partem illam aperiuntur portae Curiae : Said a dextris & a sinistris extendunt se quantum volunt secundum exigentiam locorum : dummodo recte ante curiam , vel ex opposito curiae non descendunt . Fuimus ergo ducti ad quendam Saracenum , qui non providebat nobis de aliquo cibo : sequenti die fuimus ad curiam , & fecerat extendi magnum tentorium , quia domus non potuisset capere tot homines & mulieres , quot convenerant . Monuit nos ductor noster ut non loqueremur , donec Baatu praeciperet : & tunc loqueremur breviter . Quaesivit etiam utrum misissetis nuncios ad eos . Dixi qualiter miseratis ad Kencham , & quod nec ad ipsum misissetis nuncios , nec ad Sartach literas , nisi credidissetis eos fuisse Christianos : quia non pro timore aliquo , sed ex congratulatione , quia audiveratis

 eos esse Christianos , misistis . Tunc duxit nos ad papilionem : & monebamur , ne tangeremus cordas tentorii , quas ipsi reputant loco liminis domus . Stetimus ibi nudis pedibus in habitu nostro discoopertis capitibus , & eramus spectaculum magnum in oculis eorum . Fuerat enim ibi frater Johannes de Plano carpini , sed ipse mutaverat habitum ne contemneretur ; quia erat nuncius Domini Papae . Tunc inducti fuimus usque ad medium tentorii , nec requisiverunt ut faceremus aliquam reverentiam genua flectendo , sicut solent facere nuncii . Stetimus ergo coram eo quantum possit dici , Miserere mei Deus : & omnes erant in summo silentio . Ipse verb super solium longum sedebat & latum sicut lectus , totum deauratum , ad quod ascendebatur tribus gradibus , & una domina juxta eum . Viri vero diffusi sedebant a dextris dominae & a sinistris : quod non implebant mulieres ex parte una , quia erant ibi solae uxores Baatu , implebant viri . Bancus vero cum cosmos & ciphis maximis aureis & argenteis , ornatis lapidibus praetiosis erat in introitu tentorii . Respexit ergo nos diligentius , & nos eum : & videbatur mihi similis in statura Domino Johanni de Bello monte cujus anima requiescit in pace . Erat etiam vultus ejus tunc perfusus gutta rosea . Tandem praecepit ut loquerer . Tunc ductor noster praecepit ut flecteremus genua , & loqueremur . Flexi unum genu tanquam homini : tunc innuit quod ambo flecterem , quod & feci , nolens contendere super hoc . Tunc praecepit quod loquerer . Et ego cogitans quod orarem Dominum , quia flexeram ambo genua , Incepi verba oration , dicens : Domine , nos oramus Dominum , a quo bona cuncta procedunt , qui dedit vobis ista terrena , ut debt vobis post haec coelestia : quia haec sine illis vana sunt . Et ipse diligenter auscultavit , & subjunxi : Noveritis pro certo quod coelestia non habebitis , nisi fueritis Christianus . Dicit enim Deus , Qui crediderit & baptizatus fuerit , salvus erit : qui vero non crediderit , condemnabitur . Ad illud verbum ipse modest subrisit , & alii Moal inceperunt plaudere manus deridendo nos . Et obstupuit interpres meus , quem oportuit me confortare 
 214 
 ne timerem . Tunc facto silentio , dixi : Ego veni ad filium vestrum , quia audivimus qudd esset Christianus , & attuli ei literas ex parte Domini Regis Francorum : ipse Liter* Regis misit me huc ad vos . Vos debetis scire qua de causa . Francorum . Tunc fecit me surgere . Et quaesivit nomen vestrum , & L ' 7 J meum , & socii mei , & interpretis , & fecit omnia scribi . 
 Quaesivit etiam , quia intellexerat quod exieratis terram vestram cum exercitu ut haberetis bellum . Respondi , Contra Saracenos violantes domum Dei Hierusalem . Quaesivit etiam si unquam misissetis nuncios ad eum . Ad vos dixi nunquam . Tunc fecit nos sedere , & dari de lacte suo ad bibendum , quod ipsi valde magnum reputant , quando aliquis bibit cosmos cum eo in domo sua . Et dum sedens respicerem terram , praecepit ut elevarem vultum , volens adhuc nos amplius respicere , vel forte pro sortilegio : quia habent pro malo omine vel signo , vel pro mala Prognostica , quando aliquis sedet coram eis inclinata fancy quasi tristis , maxim quum appodiat maxillam , vel mentum super manum . Tunc exivimus , & post pauca , venit Ductor noster ad nos , & ducens nos ad hospitium , dixit mihi , Dominus Rex rogat , quod retinearis in terra ista : & hoc non potest Baatu facere sine conscientia Mangu cham . Unde oportet quod tu & interpres tuus eatis ad Mangu cham . Socius vero tuus & alius homo revertentur ad curiam Sartach ibi expectantes donec revertatis . Tunc incepit homo DEI Interpres lugere reputans se perditum : Socius etiam meus contestari , quod citius amputarent ei caput , quam quod divideretur & me . Et ego dixi , quod sine socio non possem ire : Et etiam quod bene indigebamus duobus famulis , quia si contingeret unum infirmari , non possem solus remanere . Tunc ipse reversus ad curiam dixit verba Baatu . Tunc praecepit : vadant duo sacerdotes & interpres : & Clericus revertatur ad Sartach . Ille reversus dixit nobis summam . Et quando volebam loqui pro Clerico , quod iret nobiscum , dixit , Non loquamini amplius , quia Baatu definivit , & eo amplius non audeo redire ad curiam . De eleemosynam habebat Goset clericus viginti sex ipperpera , & 2^ 
 non plus : quorum decem retinuit sibi & puero : & sexdecem dedit homini Dei pro nobis . Et sic divisi sumus cum lachrimis ab invicem : Illo redeunte ad curiam Sartach , & nobis ibi remanentibus . 
 De itinere fratrum versus curiam Mangu cham . 
 IN Vigilia Assumptionis pervenit ipse clericus ad Curiam Sartach : & in crastino fuerunt Sacerdotes Nestorini induti vestimentis nostris coram Sartach . Tunc ducti fuimus ad alium hospitem , qui debebat nobis providere de domo & cibo & equis . Said quia non habuimus quod daremus ei , omnia male faciebat . Et bigavimus cum Baatu descendendo juxta Etiliam quinque septimanas . Quinque septi - Aliquando habuit socius meus tantam famem , quod manas juxta dicebat mihi quasi lachrymando : videbatur mihi quod Etiliam de - 1 , . * . 
 scendebant . nunquam comederim , horum sequitur semper Curiam 
 Baatu . Said illud erat tam long^ a nobis , quod non poteramus ire . Oportebat enim nos ire pedibus pro Quidam Hun - defectu equorum . Tandem invenerunt nos quidam & and - Hungari , qui fuerant Clericuli , quorum unus sciebat adhuc cantare multa cord , & habebatur ab aliis Hungaris quasi Sacerdos , & vocabatur ad exequias suorum defunctorum : Et alius fuerat competenter instructus in Grammatica : qui intelligebat quicquid dicebamus ei literaliter , sed nesciebat respondere : qui fecerunt nobis magnam consolationem , afferentes cosmos ad bibendum , & carnes aliquando ad comedendum : qui quum postulassent a nobis aliquos libros , & non haberem quos possem dare , nullos enim habebam , nisi Biblium & breviarium , dolui multum . Tunc dixi eis , afFerte nobis chartas , & ego scribam vobis , quamdiu erimus hfc : quod & fecerunt . Et scripsi utrasque horas Beatae Virginis & officium defunctorum . Quodam die junxit se nobis quidam Comanus . Comanus , salutans nos verbis latinis , dicens , Salvete Domini . Ego mirans , ipso resalutato , quaesivi ab eo , quis eum docuerat illam salutationem . Et ipse dixit quod in Hungaria fuit baptizatus a fratribus nostris qui docuerant illum eam . Dixit etiam quod Baatu quaesiverat ab eo 216 
 multa de nobis , & quod ipse dixerat ei conditions ordinis nostri . Ego vidi Baatu equitantem cum turba sua , & omnes patres familias equitantes cum eo , secundiim aestimationem meam non erant quingenti viri . Tandem circa finem exaltationis sanctae crucis venit ad nos quidam dives Moal , cujus pater erat millenarius , quod magnum est inter eos , dicens , Ego vos debeo ducere ad Mangu cham , & est iter quatuor mensium : & tantum frigus est ibi , quod lter iuatu^ ' finduntur ibi lapides & arbores pro frigore : Videatis a utrum poteritis sustinere . Cui respondi : Spero in ingens frigus . virtute Dei , quod nos sustinebimus , quod alii homines possunt sustinere . Tunc dixit : Si non poteritis sustinere , ego relinquam vos in via . Cui respondi , hoc non esset justum : quia non ivimus pro nobis , nisi missi a Domino vestro : Unde ex quo vobis committimur , non debetis nos dimittere . Tunc dixit , bene erit . Post hoc 
 fecit nos ostendere sibi omnes vestes nostras , & quod sibi videbatur minus necessarium fecit deponere sub custodia hospitis nostri . In crastino attulerunt cuilibet nostrum unam pelliceam villosam arietinam & braccas de eadem , & botas sive bucellos secundum morem eorum cum soccis de filtro ; & almucias de pellibus secundum 
 modum eorum . Et secunda die post exaltationem 26. Septemb. 
 Sanctas crucis incepimus equitare nos tres habentes signarios : 8c equitavimus continue versus Orientem usque ad festum Omnium Sanctorum , per totam illam terram , & adhuc amplius habitabant Cangle , quaedam Cangk populi . parentela Romanorum . Ad Aquilonem habebamus majorem Bulgariam , & ad meridiem praedictum mare Major Bul-Caspium . & ria - 
 De flumine lagag , & de diversis regionibus sive nationibus . 
 POstquam iveramus duodecim diebus ab Etilia invenimus magnum flumen , quod vocant lagag : 8c venit ab Aquilone de terra Pascatir descendens in praedictum mare . Idiom Pascatir & Hungarorum idem est : & sunt pastors sine civitate aliqua . Et con-217

 tiguatur majori Bulgariae ab Occident . Ab ilia terra versus Orientem in later illo Aquilonari non est amplius aliqua civitas . Unde Bulgaria major est ultima Hungari a regio habens civitatem . De illa region Pascatir exierunt 
 Pascatir Huni , qui postea dicti sunt Hungari . Unde ipsa est 
 onundi . major Bulgaria . Et dicit Isidorus , qudd pernicibus 
 equis claustra Alexandri rupibus Caucasi feras gentes cohibentia transierunt : ita quod usque in jEgyptum solvebatur eis tributum . Destruxerunt etiam omnes terras usque in Franciam . Unde fuerunt majoris potentiae , quam sunt adhuc Tartari . Cum illis occurrerunt Blaci & Bulgari & Vandali . De illa enim majori Bulgaria venerunt illi Bulgari : Et qui sunt ultra Danubium propd Constantinopolin , & juxta Pascatir sunt Ilac , quod idem est quod Blac : said B. nesciunt Nota. Tartari sonare : a quibus venerunt illi qui sunt in terra 
 Assani . Utrosque enim vocant Ilac , & hos & illos lingua Rutenorum & Polonorum , & Boemorum . Scla-vorum est idem idioma cum lingua Vandalorum , quorum omnium manus fuit cum Hunis : & nunc pro majori parte est cum Tartaris quos Deus suscitavit a remotioribus partibus , populum multum , & gentem stultam , Deut. 32.21 . secundum quod dicit Dominus , Provocabo eos , id est , non custodientes Legem suam , in eo qui non est populus , & in gente stulta irritabo eos : Hoc completur ad literam super omnes nationes non custodientes Legem Dei . Hoc quod dixi de terra Pascatir scio per fratres Praedicatores , | | qui iverunt illuc ante adventum Tartarorum . Et ex tunc erant ipsi subjugati a vicinis Bulgaris Saracenis , & plures eorum facti Saraceni . Alia possunt sciri per Chronica : quia constat quod illae provinciae post Constantinopolim , quae modo dicuntur Bulgaria , Valachia , Sclavonia , fuerunt provinciae Graecorum . Hungaria fuit Pannonia . Equitavimus ergo per terram Cangle a festo Sanctae crucis usque ad festum Omnium Sanctorum , quolibet die fere quantum est a Parisiis usque Aurelianum , secundum quod possum estimare , & plus aliquando : secundum quod habebamus copiam equorum . Aliquando 218 
 enim mutabamus bis in die vel ter equos . Aliquando ibamus duobus diebus vel tribus , quibus non inveniebamus populum , & oportebat levius ire . De viginti vel triginta equis nos semper habebamus pejores , quia extranei eramus . Omnes enim accipiebant ante nos equos meliores . Mihi semper providebant de forti equo , quia 
 eram ponderosus valde : sed utrum suaviter ambularet 
 vel non , de hoc non auderem facere quaestionem . Nec etiam audebam conqueri , si dure portaret . Said fortunam 
 suam oportebat unumquemque sustinere . Unde oriebatur nobis difficillimus labour : quia multoties fatigabantur equi , antequam possemus pervenire ad populum . 
 Et tunc oportebat nos percutere & flagellare equos , ponere etiam vestes super alios saginarios , mutare equos saginarios ; aliquando nos duos ire in uno equo . 
 De fame & siti , & aliis miseriis quas sustinuerunt in itinere . 
 DE fame & siti , frigore & fatigatione non est numerus . Non enim daunt cibum nisi in sero . In mane daunt aliquid bibere , vel sorbere milium . In sero dabant nobis carnes , scapulam arietis cum costis & de brodio ad mensuram bibere . Quando habebamus de brodio carnium ad satietatem optimi reficiebamur . Et videbatur mihi suavissimus potus & maxim nutriens , Feria sexta permanebam jejunus usque ad noctem , nihil hauriens . Tunc oportebat me in tristitia & dolore comedere carnes . Aliquando oportebat nos comedere carnes semicoctas vel fere crudas propter defectum materiae ignis , Defectus mate-quando jacebamus in campis & de nocte descendebamus : rite ignis . quia tunc non poteramus bene colligere stercora equorum vel boum : aliam materiam ignis raro inveniebamus ; nisi fort alicubi aliquas spinas . In ripis etiam aliquorum Aliqua fluminum sunt alicubi sylvae . Said hoc rard . In principio flumina . despiciebat nos multum Ductor noster , & fastidiebat eum ducere tam viles homines . Postea tamen quando incepit nos melius cognoscere , ducebat nos per curias divitum Moallorum : & oportebat nos orare pro ipsis . Unde si

Et mirabantur supra modum , quia nolebamus recipere aurum , vel argentum , vel vestes praeciosas . Quaerebant etiam de magno Papam , si esset ita senex sicut audierant : audierant enim quod esset quingentorum annorum . Quaerebant de terris nostris si ibi essent multae oves , & boves , & equi . De Oceano mari non potuerunt intelligere , quod esset sine termino vel sine

 De interfectione Ban & habitation Teutonicorum . 
 ^Equenti die venimus ad aliud casale propinquius O montibus . Et quaesivi de montibus , de quibus intellexi , quod essent montes Caucasi : qui contiguantur ex utraque parte maris ab Occident usque ad Orientem : & quod transiveramus mare supradictum , quod intrat Etilia . Quaesivi etiam de Talas civitate , in qua erant Teutonici servi Buri , de quibus dixerat frater Andreas , de quibus etiam quaesiveram multum in curia Sartach & Baatu . Said nihil poteram intelligere , nisi quod Ban dominus eorum fuerat interfectus tali occasion . Ipse non erat in bonis pascuis . Et quadam die dum esset ebrius , loquebatur ita cum hominibus suis . Nonne sum de genere Chingis can sicut Baatus ( Et ipse erat nepos Baatu vel frater ) quare non vadam super ripam Etiliae , sicut Baatu , ut pascam ibi ? Quae verba relata fuerunt Baatu . Tunc ipse Baatu scripsit hominibus illius , ut adducerent ei dominum ipsorum vinctum : quod & fecerunt . Tunc Baatu quaesivit ab eo si dixisset tale verbum : & ipse confessus est , tamen excusavit se , quia ebrius erat : ( quia solent condonare ebriis : ) & Baatu respondit : Quomodo audebas me nominare in ebrietate tua ? Et fecit ei amputari caput . De illis Teutonicis nihil potui cognoscere usque ad curiam Mangu . Said in supradicto casali intellexi , quod Talas erat post nos juxta montes per sex dietas . Quando veni ad curiam Mangu cham , intellexi quod ipse Mangu transtulerat eos de licentia Baatu versus Orientem spacio itineris unius mensis a Talas ad quandam villam quae dicitur Bolae : ubi fodiunt aurum , & fabricant arma . Unde non potui ire nec redire per eos . Transivi eundo satis prope , per tres dietas forte , civitatem illam : sed ego ignoravi : nec potuissem etiam declinasse extra viam , si bene scivissem . A praedicto casali ivimus ad Orientem juxta montes praedictos : & ex tunc intravimus inter homines Mangu cham , qui ubique cantabant & plaudebant coram ductore

 nostro : quia ipse erat nuncius Baatu . Hunc enim honorem exhibent sibi mutuo , ut homines Mangu cham recipiant nuncios Baatu praedicto modo : Et similiter homines Baatu nuncios Mangu . Tamen homines Baatu superiores sunt , nec exequuntur ita diligenter . Paucis diebus post hoc intravimus Alpes , in quibus solebant habitare Cara catay : & invenimus ibi magnum fluvium , quem oportuit nos transire navigio . Post haec intravimus quandam vallem , ubi vidi castrum quoddam destructum , cujus muri non erant nisi de luto , & terra colebatur ibi . Et pdst invenimus quandam bonam villam quae dicitur Equius , in qua erant Saraceni loquentes Persicum : longissime tamen erant a Perside . Sequenti die transgressis illis Alpibus quae descendebant a magnis montibus ad meridiem , ingressi sumus pulcherrimam planiciem habentem montes altos & dextris , & quoddam mare a sinistris , sive quendam lacum qui durat quindecem dietas in circuitu . Et illa planicies tota irrigabatur ad libitum aquis descendentibus de montibus , quae omnes recipiuntur in illud mare . In aestate redivimus ad latus Aquilonare illius maris , ubi similiter erant magni montes . In planicie praedicta solebant esse multae villae : sed pro majori parte omnes erant destructae , ut pascerent ibi Tartari : quia optima pascua erant ibi . Unam magnam villam invenimus ibi nomine Cailac , in qua erat forum , & frequentabant eam multi mercatores . In illa quievimus quindecem diebus , expectantes quendam scriptorem Baatu , qui debebat esse socius ducis nostri in negotiis expediendis in curia Mangu . Terra illa solebat dici Organum : & solebant habere proprium idioma , & propriam literam : said haec tota erat occupata a Contomannis . Etiam in literatura illa & idiomate solebant facere Nestorini de partibus illis . Dicuntur Organa , quia solebant esse optimi Organistae vel Citharistae , ut dicebatur mihi . Ibi primo vidi Idolatrias , de quibus noveritis , quod sunt multae sectae in Orient . 
 222 
 Quod Nestorini et Saraceni sunt mixti & Idolatrae . 
 PRimi sunt Jugures , quorum terra contiguatur cum terra praedicta Organum inter montes illos versus Orientem : Et in omnibus civitatibus eorum sunt mixti Nestorini & Saraceni . Et ipsi etiam sunt diffusi versus Persidem in civitatibus Saracenorum . In praedicta civitate Cealac habebant etiam ipsi tres Idolatrias , quarum duas intravi , ut viderem stultitias eorum . In prima inveni quendam , qui habebat cruciculam de atramento super manum suam . Unde credidi quod esset Christianus : quia ad omnia quae quaerebam ab eo , respondebat ut Christianus . Unde quaesivi ab eo : Quare ergo non habetis crucem & imaginem Jesu Christi ? Et ipse respondit , non habemus consuetudinem , unde ego credidi quod essent Christiani : sed ex defectu doctrinae omitterent . Videbam enim ibi post quandam cistam , quae erat eis loco altaris , super quam ponunt lucernas & oblationes , quandam imaginationem habentem alas quasi Sancti Michaelis : & alias quasi ipsorum tenentes digitos sicut ad benedicendum . Illo sero non potui aliud invenire . Quia Saraceni in tantum invitant eos , quod nec etiam volunt loqui inde eis . Unde quando quaerebam a Saracenis de ritu talium , ipsi scandalizabantur . In crastino fuerunt kalendae & pascha Saracenorum & mutavi hospitium : ita quod fui hospi-tatus prope aliam Idolatriam . Homines enim colligunt nuncios , quilibet secundum posse suum vel portionem suam . Tunc intrans Idolatriam praedictam inveni sacerdotes Idolorum . In kalendis enim aperiunt templa sua , & ornant se sacerdotes , & offerunt populi oblationes de pane & fructibus . Primd ergo describo vobis ritus communes omnes Idolatrarum : & postea istorum Jugurum ; qui sunt quasi secta divisa ab aliis . Omnes adorant ad Aquilonem complosis manibus : & prosternentes se genibus flexis ad terram , ponentes frontem super manus . Unde Nestorini in partibus illis nullo modo jungunt manus orando : said orant extensis palmis ante pectus .

 Porrigunt templa sua ab Orient in Occidentem : & in later Aquilonari faciunt cameram unam quasi eorum exeuntem : vel aliter , Si est domus quadrata , in medio domus ad latus aquilonare intercludunt unam cameram in loco chori . Ibi ergo collocant unam arcam longam & latam sicut mensam unam . Et post illam arcam contra meridiem collocant principal idolum : quod ego vidi apud Caracarum , ita magnum sicut pingitur Sanctus Christopherus . Et dixit mihi quidam sacerdos Nestorinus , qui venerat ex Cataya , quod in terra illa est Idolum ita magnum , quod potest videri a duabus dietis . Et collocant alia idola in circuitu , omnia pulcherrime deaurata : Super cistam illam , quae est quasi mensa una , ponunt lucernas & oblationes . Omnes portae templorum sunt apertae ad meridiem contrario modo Saracenis . Item habent campanas magnas sicut nos . Ideo credo quod orientales Christiani noluerunt habere eas . Ruteni tamen habent & Graeci in Gasaria . 
 De templis eorum & idolis , & qualiter se habent in officio deorum suorum . 
 OMnes sacerdotes eorum rasum habent totum caput & barbam ; sunt vestiti de croceo , & servant castitatem , ex quo radunt caput : Et vivunt pariter centum vel ducenti in una congregation . Diebus quibus intrant templum , ponunt duo scamna , & sedent e region chorus contra chorum habentes libros in manibus , quos aliquando deponunt super illa scamna : & habent capita discooperta quamdiu insunt in templo , legentes in silencio , & tenentes silencium . Unde ciim ingressus fuissem apud Oratorium quoddam eorum , & invenissem eos ita sedentes , multis modis tentavi eos provocare ad verba , & nullo modo potui . Habent etiam quocunque vadunt quendam restem centum vel ducentorum nucleorum , sicut nos portamus pater noster : Et dicunt semper haec verba : Ou mam Hactavi : hoc est , Deus tu nosti ; secundum quod quidem eorum interpretatus est mihi . Et toties expectant remunerationem a Deo , quoties hoc 
 224 
 I253-dicendo memoratur Dei . Circa templum suum semper faciunt pulchrum atrium , quod bene includunt muro : & ad meridiem faciunt portam magnam , in qua sedent ad colloquendum . Et super illam portam erigunt perticam longam , quae emineat si possint , super totam villam . Et per illam perticam potest cognosci , quod domus illa sit templum Idolorum . Ista communia sunt omnibus Idolatris . Quando ergo ingressus fui praedictam Idolatriam , inveni sacerdotes sedentes sub porta exteriori . Illi quos vidi , videbantur mihi fratres Franci esse rasis barbis . 
 Tyaras habebant in capitibus cartaceas . Istorum Jugu - Tyara rum sacerdotes habent talem habitum quocunque vadunt : cartaceee-semper sunt in tunicis croceis satis strictis accincti desuper recte sicut Franci : & habent pallium super humerum sinistrum descendens involutum per pectus & dorsum ad latus dextrum sicut diaconus portans casulam in quadragesima . Istorum literas acceperunt Tartari . Ipsi in - Chinenses ita cipiunt scribere sursum , & ducunt lineam deorsum , & etiam scribunt . eodem modo ipsi legunt & multiplicant lineas a sinistra ad dextram . Isti multum utuntur cards & caracteribus pro sortilegio . Unde templa sua plena sunt brevibus Sortilegi . suspensis . Et Mangucham mittit vobis literas in idiomate Moal & literatura eorum . Isti comburunt mortuos Combustio suos secundum antiquum modum , & recondunt pulverem m°rtuorum . in summitate pyramidis . Cum ergo sedissem juxta . praedictos sacerdotes , postquam ingressus fueram templum & vidissem idola eorum multa magna & parva : quaesivi ab eis , quid ipsi crederent de Deo. Qui responderunt , Non credimus nisi unum Deum . Et ego quaesivi . Creditis quod ipse sit spiritus vel aliquid corporal ? Dixerunt , credimus quod sit spiritus . Et ego : Creditis quod nunquam sumpserit humanam naturam ? Dixerunt , minime . Tunc ego : ex quo creditis , quod non sit nisi unus spiritus , quare facitis ei imagines corporales , & tot insuper ? Et ex quo non creditis quod factus sit homo , quare facitis ei magis imagines hominum , quam alterius animalis ? Tunc responderunt , Nos non figuramus istas imagines Deo. Said quando aliquis dives moritur ex 
 i 225 p 
 nostris , vel filius , vel uxor , vel aliquis charus ejus facit fieri imaginem defuncti , & ponit eam hic : & nos veneramur eam ad memoriam ejus . Quibus ego , Tunc ergo non facitis ista nisi propter adulationem hominum . Immo dixerunt ad memoriam . Tunc quaesiverunt a me quasi deridendo : ubi est Deus ? Quibus ego . Ubi est anima vestra ? Dixerunt , in corpore nostro . Quibus ego . 
 Nonne est ubique in corpore tuo & totum regit , & tamen non videtur ? Ita Deus ubique est , & omnia gubernat , invisibilis tamen , quia intellectus & sapientia est . Tunc cum vellem plura ratiocinari cum illis , interpres meus fatigatus , non valens verba exprimere , fecit me tacere . Istorum sectae sunt Moal sive Tartari , quantum ad hoc , quod ipsi non credunt nisi unum Deum : tamen faciunt de filtro imagines defunctorum suorum , & induunt eas quinque pannis preciocissimis , & ponunt in una biga vel duabus , & illas bigas nullus audet tangere : & sunt sub custodia divinatorum suorum , qui sunt eorum sacerdotes , de quibus postea narrabo vobis . Isti divinatores semper sunt ante curiam ipsius Mangu & aliorum divi-tum : pauperes enim non habent eos ; nisi illi qui sunt de genere Chingis . Et cum debent bigare , ipsi praecedunt , sicut columna nubis filios Israel , & ipsi considerant locum metandi castra , & post deponunt domos suas ; & post , eos tota curia . Et tunc cum sit dies festus sive as imagines & ponunt eas 
 ordinate per circuitum in domo sua . Tunc veniunt Moal & ingrediuntur domum illam , & inclinant se imaginibus illis & venerantur illas . Et illam domum nemini ingredi extraneo licet : Quadam enim vice volui ingredi & multum dur^ increpatus fui . 
 De diversis nationibus , & de illis qui comedere solebant parents suos . 
 PRaedicti vero Jugures , qui sunt mixti cum Christianis & Saracenis , per frequentes disputationes , ut credo , pervenerunt ad hoc , quod non credunt nisi unum deum . Et isti fuerunt habitantes in civitatibus , qui post obedi-226 
 kalendae ipsi extrahunt predict 
 verunt Chingis Cham : unde ipse dedit regi eorum filiam suam . Et ipsa Caracarum est quasi in territorio eorum : Et tota terra regis sive presbyteri Johannis & Vut fratris ejus circa terras eorum : said isti in pascuis ad aquilonem , illi Jugures inter montes ad meridiem . Inde est quod ipsi Moal sumpserunt literas eorum . Et ipsi sunt magni scriptores eorum : & omnes fere Nestorini sciunt literas 
 eorum . Post istos sunt ipsi Tangut ad orientem inter montes illos , homines fortissimi , qui ceperunt Chingis in fortissimi . 
 bello . Et pace facta dimissus ab eis , postea subjugavit eos . Isti habent boves fortissimos habentes caudas plenas pilis sicut equi , & ventres pilosos & dorsa . Bassiores sunt aliis bobus in tibiis , sed ferociores multum . Isti trahunt magnas domos Moallorum : & habent cornua gracilia , longam , acuosa , acutissima : ita quod oportet semper secare summitates eorum . Vacca non permittit se injungi nisi cantetur ei . Habent etiam naturam bubali quia si vident hominem indutum rubeis , insiliunt in eum volentes interficere . Post illos sunt Tebet homines solentes comedere parents suos defunctos , ut causa pietatis non facerent aliud sepulchrum eis nisi viscera sua . Modo tamen hoc dimiserunt , quia abominabiles erant omni nationi . Tamen adhuc faciunt pulchros ciphos de capitibus parentum , ut illis bibentes habeant memoriam eorum in jocunditate sua . Hoc dixit mihi qui viderat . Isti habent multum de auro in terra sua . Unde qui indiget auro , fodit donec reperiat , & accipiat quando indiget , residuum condens in terra : quia si reponeret in arca vel in thesauro , crederet quod Deus auferret ei aliud quod est in terra . De istis hominibus vidi personas multum deforms . Tangut vidi homines magnos sed fuscos . Jugures sunt mediocris staturae sicut nostri . Apud Jugures est fons & radix ideomatis Turei & Comanici . Post Tebet sunt Langa & Solanga , quorum nuncios vidi in curia : Qui adduxerant magnas bigas plusquam decem , quarum quaelibet trahebatur sex bobus . Isti sunt parvi homines & fusci sicut Hispani : & habent tunicas

Et circa tempora habent longas bendas de eadem materia assutas ipsi mitrae ; quae se extendunt ad ventum sicut duo cornua egredientia de temporibus . Et quando ventus nimis jactat eas plicant eas per medium mitrae superius a tempore in tempus : & jacent sicut circulus ex transverso capitis . Et principalis nuncius quando veniebat ad curiam , habebat tabulam de dente elephantino ad longitudinem unius cubiti , & ad latitudinem unius palmi , rasam multum : Et quandocunque loquebatur ipsi Cham , vel alicui magno viro , semper aspiciebat in illam tabulam , ac si inveniret ibi ea quae dicebat : nec respiciebat ad dextram vel sinistram , nec in faciem illius cui loquebatur .

Et si nuncius vel aliquis extraneus accedat ad regionem illam , ipsi includunt eum in domo , & ministrant ei necessaria , donec negocium ejus fuerit expeditum . Quia si iret extraneus per regionem , animalia ad odorem ejus fugerent , & efficerentur sylvestria . Ultra est magna Cathaya , cujus incolae antiquitus ut credo dicebantur Seres . Ab ipsis enim veniunt optimi panni serici . Et ille populus dicitur Seres a quodam oppido eorum . Bene intellexi , quod in illa region est oppidum habens muros argenteos & propugnacula aurea .

 The journal of friar William de Rubruquis a French man of the order of the minorite friars , unto the East parts of the world . An. Dom. 
 1253 - 
 O his most Sovereign , & most Christian Lord Lewis , by Gods grace the renowned king of France , friar William de Rubruk , the meanest of the Minorites order , wishes health & continual triumph in CHRIST . 
 It is written in the book of Ecclesi - Ecclus. 39. 
 asticus concerning the wise man : He shall travel for - +• into foreign countries , and good and evil shall he try in all things . The very same actium ( my lord and king ) have I achieved : howbeit I wish that I have done it 
 like a wise man , and not like a fool . For many there be , that perform the same actium which a wise man does , not wisely but more undiscreetly : of which number I fear my self to be one . Notwithstanding howsoever I have done it , because you commanded me , when I departed from your highness , to write all things unto you , which I should see among the Tartars , and you wished me also that I should not fear to write long letters , I have done as your majesty enjoined me : yet with fear and reverence , because I want words and eloquence sufficient to write unto so great a majesty . Be it known therefore unto your sacred Majesty , that in the year of our Lord 1253. about the Nonce of May , we entered into the sea of Pontus , which the Bulgarians call the great sea . It containeth in length ( as I learned of certain merchant's ) 1008 miles , and is in a manner , divided into two parts . About the midst thereof are two provinces , one towards the North , and another towards the South . The South province is called Synopolis , and it is the castle and port of the Soldan of Turkey : but the North province is called of the Latines , Gasaria : of the Greeks , which 
 229 
 inhabit upon the sea shore thereof , it is called Cassaria , that is to say Caesaria . And there are certain head lands stretching forth into the sea towards Synopolis . Also , there are 300. miles of distance between Synopolis and Cassaria . Insomuch that the distance from those points or places to Constantinople , in length and breadth is about 700. miles : and 700. miles also from thence to the East , namely to the country of Hiberia which is a province of Gasaria . Georgia . At the province of Gasaria or Cassaria we arrived , which province is , in a manner , three square , having a city on the West part thereof called Kersova , wherein S. Clement suffered martyrdom . And sailing before the said city , we saw and island , in which a Church is said to be built by the hands of angels . But about the midst of the said province towards the South , as it were , upon a sharp angle or point , stands a city called Sold ala . Soldaia directly over against Synopolis . And there do 
 all the Turkey merchant's , which traffic into the North countries , in their journey outward , arrive , and as they return homeward also from Russia , and the said Northern regions , into Turkey . The foresaid merchant's transport thither ermines and grey furs , with other rich and costly skins . Others carry clothes made of cotton or bombast , and silk , and diverse kinds of spices . But upon the East part of the said province stands a city The ritie of called Matriga , where the river Tanais dischargeth his Matriga . streams into the sea of Pontus , the mouth whereof is twelve miles in breadth . For this river , before it entereth into the sea of Pontus , makes a little sea , which hath in breadth and length seven hundreth miles , & it is in no place thereof above sixe paces deep , whereupon great vessels cannot sail over it . Howbeit the merchant's of \\Matriga . Constantinople , arriving at the foresayd ci tie of II Materta , send their barks unto the river of Tanais to buy dried fish , Sturgeons , Thosses , Barbils , and and infinite number of other fish . The foresaid province of Cassaria is compassed in with the sea on three sides thereof : namely on the West side , where Kersova the city of Saint 
 230 
 Clement is situate : on the South side the city of Soldaia whereat we arrived : on the East side Maricandis , and there stands the city of Matriga upon the mouth of the river Tanais . Beyond the said mouth stands Zikia , Zikia . which is not in subjection unto the Tartars : also the people called Suevi and Hiberi towards the East , who likewise are not under the Tartars dominion . Moreover towards the South , stands the city of Trapesunda , which hath a governor proper to it self , nam Guydo , being of the lineage of the emperors of Constantinople , and is subject unto the Tartars . Next unto that is Synopolis the city of the Soldan of Turkey , who likewise is in subjection unto them . Next unto these lies the country of Vastacius , whose son is called Astar , of his grandfather by the mother's side , who is not in subjection . All the land from the mouth of Tanais Westward as far as Danubius is under their jurisdiction . 
 Yea beyond Danubius also , towards Constantinople , Valakia , which is the land of Assanus , and Bulgaria minor as far as Solonia , do all pay tribute unto them . And beside the tribute imposed , they have also , of late years , exacted of every household and axe , and all such corn as they found lying on heaps . We arrived therefore at Soldaia the twelfth of the Kalends of June . And diverse merchant's of Constantinople , which were arrived there before us , reported that certain messengers were coming thither from the holy land , who were desirous to travel unto Sartach . Notwithstanding I my self had publicly given out upon Palm Sunday within the Church of Sancta Sophia , that I was not your nor any other men messenger , but that I travailed unto those infidels according to the rule of our order . And being arrived , the said merchant's admonished me to take diligent heed what I spoke : because they having reported me to be a messenger , if I should say the contrary , that I were no messenger , I could not have free passage granted unto me . 
 Then I spoke after this manner unto the governors of the city , or rather unto their Lieutenants , because the 
 231 
 governors themselves were gone to pay tribute unto Baatu , & were not as yet returned . We herd of your lord Sartach ( quoth I ) in the holy land , that he was become a Christian : and the Christians were exceeding glad thereof , & especially the most Christian king of France , who is there now in pilgrimage , & fights against the Saracens to redeem the holy places out of their hands : wherefore I am determined to go unto Sartach , & to deliver unto him you letters of my lord the king , wherein he admonisheth him concerning the good and commodity of all Christendome . And they received us with gladness , and gave us enterteinement in the cathedral Church . The bishop of which Church was with Sartach , who told me many good things concerning the said Sartach , which afterwards I found to be nothing so . Then put they us to our choice , whither we would have carts and oxen , or pack horses to transport our carriages . And the merchants of Constantinople advised me , not to take carts of the citizens of Soldaia , but to buy covered carts of mine own , ( such as the Russians carry their skins in ) and to put all our carriages , which I would daily take out , into them : because , if I should use horses , I must be constrained at every bait to take down my carriages , and to lift them up again on sundry horses backs : and beside , that I should ride a more gentle pace by the oxen drawing the carts . Wherefore , contenting my self with their evil counsel , I was traveling unto Sartach 2. months which I could have done in one , if I had gone by horse . I brought with me from Constantinople ( being by the merchants advised so to do ) pleasant fruits , muscadel wine , and delicate biscuit bred to present unto the governors of Soldaia , to the end I might obtain free passage : because they look favourably upon no man which comes with and empty hand . All which things I bestowed in one of my carts , ( not finding the governors of the city at home ) for they told me , if I could carry them to Sartach , that they would be most acceptable unto him . we took our journey therefore about the 
 232 
 kalends of June , with fower covered carts of our own and with two other which we borrowed of them , wherein we carried our bedding to rest upon in the night , and they allowed us five horses to ride upon . For there were just five persons in our company : namely , I my self and mine associate friar Bartholomew of Cremona , and Goset the bearer of these presents , the man of God Turgemannus , and Nicolas my servant , whom I bought at Constantinople with some part of the alms bestowed upon me . Moreover , they allowed us two men , which drave our carts and gave attendance unto our oxen and horses . There be high promontories on the sea shore from Kersova unto the mouth of Tanais . Also there are fortie castles between Kersova and Soldaia , every one of which almost have their proper languages : among whom there were many Gothes , who spoke the Dutch tongue . Beyond the said mountains towards the North , there is a most beautiful wood growing on a plain full of fountains & freshets . And beyond the wood there is a mighty plain champion , continuing five days journey unto the very extremity and borders of the said province northward , and there it is a narrow Isthmus or neck land , having sea on the East & West sides thereof , insomuch that there is a ditch made from one sea unto the other . In the same plain ( before the Tartars sprang up ) were the Comanians wont to inhabit , who compelled the foresaid cities and castles to pay tribute unto them . But when the Tartars came upon them , the multitude of the Comanians entered into the foresaid province , and fled all of them , even unto the sea shore , being in such extreme famine , that they which were alive , were constrained to eat up those which were dead : and ( as a merchant reported unto me who saw it with his own eyes ) that the living men devoured and tore with their teeth , the raw flesh of the dead , as dogs would gnaw upon carrion . Towards the borders of the said province there be many great lake's : upon the banks whereof are salt pits or fountains , the water of which so soon as it entereth into 
 233 
 Frier Bartholomeus de Cremona . 
 The neck of Taurica Chersonesus . 
 the lake , becomes hard salt like unto ice . And out of those salt pits Baatu and Sartach have great revenues : for they repair thither out of all Russia for salt : and for each cart load they give two webs of cotton amounting to the valve of half and Yperpera . There come by sea also many ships for salt , which pay tribute every one of them according to their burden . The third day after we were departed out of the precincts of Soldaia , we 
 The Tartars , found the Tartars . among whom being entered , me thought I was come into a new world . Whose life and manners I will describe unto your Highness as well as I can . 
 Of the Tartars , and of their houses . Chap. 2. 
 THey have in no place any settled city to abide in , neither know they of the celestial city to come . 
 They have divided all Scythia among themselves , which stretcheth from the river Danubius even unto the rising of the sun . And every of their captains , according to the great or small number of his people , knoweth the bounds of his pastures , and where he ought to feed his cattle winter and summer , Spring and autumn . For in the winter they descend unto the warm regions southward . And in the summer they ascend unto the cold regions northward . In winter when snow lies upon the ground , they feed their cattle upon pastures without water , because then they use snow in stead of water . Their houses wherein they sleep , they ground upon a round foundation of wickers artificially wrought and compacted together : the roof whereof consisteth ( in like sort ) of wickers , meeting above into one little roundel , out of which roundel ascendeth upward a neck like unto a chimney , which they cover with white felt , and oftentimes they lay mortar or white earth upon the said felt , with the powder of bones , that it may shine white . And sometime also they cover it with black felt . The said felt on the neck of their house , they do garnish over with beautiful variety of pictures . Before the door likewise they hang a felt curiously painted over . For 
 234 
 1253-they spend all their coloured felt , in painting vines , trees , birds , and beasts thereupon . The said houses they make so large , that they contain thirtie foot in breadth . 
 For measuring once the breadth between the wheele-ruts of one of their carts , I found it to be 2 oh feet over : and when the house was upon the cart , it stretched over the wheels on each side five feet at the least . I told 22. oxen in one term , drawing and house upon a cart , eleven in one order according to the breadth of the cart , and eleven more before them : the axletree of the cart was of and huge bigness like unto the mast of a ship . And a fellow stood in the door of the house , upon the forestall of the cart driving forth the oxen . Moreover , they make certain foursquare baskets of small slender wickers as big as great chests : and afterwards , from one side to another , they frame and hollow lid or cover of such like wickers , and make a door in the before side thereof . And then they cover the said chest or little house with black felt rubbed over with tallow or sheeps milk to keep the rain from soaking through , which they deck likewise with painting or with feathers . And in such chests they put their whole household stuff & treasure . Also the same chests they do strongly bind upon other carts , which are drawn with camels , to you end they may wade through rivers . Neither do they at any time take down the said chests from ofF their carts . When they take down their dwelling houses , they turn the doors always to the South : & next of all they place the carts laden with their chests , here & there , within half a stones cast of you house : insomuch that the house stands between two ranks of carts , as it were , between two walls . The matrons make for themselves most beautiful carts , which I am not The benefits of able to describe unto your majesty but by pictures only : “ f^ntertn for I would right willingly have painted all things for you , C°Un~ had my skill been ought in that art . One rich Moal or Tartar hath 200. or 100. such carts with chests . Duke Baatu hath sixteene wives , every one of which hath one great house , beside other little houses , which they place 
 235 
 behind the great one , being as it were chambers for their maidens to dwell in . And unto every of the said houses do belong 200. carts . When they take their houses from off the carts , the principal wife places her court on the West frontier , and so all the rest in their order : so that the last wife dwells upon the East frontier : and one of the said ladies courts is distant from another about a stones cast . Whereupon the court of one rich Moal or Tartar will appear like unto a great village , very few men abiding in the same . One woman will guide 20. or 30. carts at once , for their countries are very plain , and they bind the carts with camels or oxen , one behind another . And there sits a wench in the foremost cart driving the oxen , and all the residue follow on a like pace . When they chance to come at any bad passage , they let them lose , and guide them over one by one : for they go a slow pace , as fast as a lamb or and ox can walk . 
 Of their beds , and of their drinking pots . 
 Chap. 3. 
 HAving taken down their houses from off their carts , and turning the doors Southward , they place the bed of the master of the house , at the North part thereof . The women's place is always on the East side , namely on the left hand of the good man of the house sitting upon his bed with his face Southwards : but the men's place is upon you West side , namely at the right hand of their master . Men when they enter into the house , will not in any case hang their quivers on the women's side . Over the master's head there is always and image , like a puppet , made of felt , which they call the master's brother : and another over the head of the good wife or mistress , which they call her brother being fastened to the wall : and above between both of them , there is a little lean one , which is , as it were the keeper of the whole house . The good wife or mistress of the house places aloft at her beds feet , on the right hand , the skin of a Kid stuffed with wool or some other matter , and near unto 
 236 
 that a little image or puppet looking towards the maidens and women . Next unto the door also on the women's side , there is another image with a cows udder , for the women that milk the kine . For it is the duty of their women to milk kine . On the other side of the door next unto the men , there is another image with the udder of a mare , for the men which milk mares . And when they come together to drink and make merry , they sprinkle part of their drink upon the image which is above the master's head : afterwards upon other images in order : then goes a servant out of the house with a cup full of drink sprinkling it thrice towards the South , and bowing his knee at every time : and this is done for the honour of the fire . Then performeth he the like superstitious idolatry towards the East , for the honour of the air : and then to the West for the honour of the water : & lastly to the North in the behalf of the dead . When the master holds a cup in his hand to drink , before he tasteth thereof , he poureth his part upon the ground . If he drinketh sitting on horse back , he poureth out part thereof upon the neck or main of his horse before he himself drinketh . After the servant aforesaid hath so discharged his cups to the fower quarters of the world , he returns into the house : and two other servants stand ready with two cups , and two basons , to carry drink unto their master and his wife , sitting together upon a bed . And if he hath more wives then one , she with whom he slept the night before , sitteth by his side the day following : and all his other wives must that day resort unto the same house to drink : and there is the court held for that day : the gifts also which are presented that day are laid up in the chests of the said wife . And upon a bench stands a vessel of milk or of other drink and drinking cups . 
 237 
 [ Of their 
 They use the like custom in Florida . 
 Of their drinks , and how they provoke one another to drinking . Chap. 4. 
 IN winter time they make excellent drink of Rise , of Mill , and of honey , being well and high coloured like wine . Also they have wine brought unto them from far countries . In summer time they care not for any drink , but Cosmos . And it stands always within the entrance of his door , and next unto it stands a minstrel with his fiddle . 1 saw there no such citerns and vials as ours commonly be , but many other musical instruments which are not used among us . And when the master of the house begins to drink , one of his servants cryeth out with a loud voice WOULD , and the minstrel plays upon his fiddle . And when they make any great solemn feast , they all of them clap their hands & dance to the noise of music , the men before their master and the women before their mistress . And when the master hath drunk , then cries out his servant as before , and the minstrel stays his music . Then drink they all around both men and women : and sometime they carouse for the victory very filthily and drunkenly . Also when they will provoke any man , they pull him by the ears to the drink , and so lug and draw him strongly to stretch out his throat clapping their hands and dancing before him . Moreover when some of them will make great feasting and rejoicing , one of the company takes a full cup , and two other stand , one on his right hand and another on his left , and so they three come singing to the man who is to have the cup reached unto him , still singing and dancing before him : and when he stretcheth forth his hand to receive the cup , they leap suddenly back , returning again as they did before , and so having deluded him thrice or fower times by drawing back the cup until he be merry , and hath got a good appetite , then they give him the cup , singing and dancing and stamping with their feet , until he hath done drinking . 
 238 
 Of their food and victuals . Chap. 5. 
 / concerning their food and victuals , be it known unto kJ your Highness that they do , without all difference or exception , eat all their dead carrions . And among so many droves it cannot be , but some cattle must needs die . Howbeit in summer , so long as their Cosmos , that is , their mares milk lasteth , they care not for any food . And if they chance to have and ox or and horse die , they dry the flesh thereof : for cutting it into thin slices and hanging it up against the Sun and the wind , it is Dryingofflesh presently dried without salt , and also without stench tn the mnd " or corruption . They make better puddings of their horses then of their hogs , which they eat being new made : the rest of the flesh they reserve until winter . They make of their ox skins great bladders or bags , which they do wonderfully dry in the smoke . Of the hinder part of their horse hides they make very fine sandals & pantoffles . They give unto 50. or and 100. men the flesh of one ram to eat . For they mince it in a bowl with salt and water ( other sauce they have none ) and then with the point of a knife , or a little fork which they make for the same purpose ( such as we use to take roasted pears or apples out of wine withal ) they reach unto every one of the company a morsel ! or twaine , according to the multitude of guests . The master of the house , before the rams flesh be distributed , first of all himself takes thereof , what he pleases . Also , if he gives unto any of the company a speciali part , the receiver thereof must eat it alone , and must not impart ought thereof unto any other . Not being able to eat it up all , he caries it with him , or delivers it unto his boy , if he be present , to keep it : if not , he puts it up into his Saptargat , that is to say , his foure square buget , which they use to carry about with them for the saving of all such provision , and wherein they lay up their bones , when they have not time to gnaw them thoroughly , that they may burnish them afterwards , 
 239 
 1253-to the end that no whit of their food may come to nought . 
 How they make their drink called Cosmos . Chap. 6. 
 THeir drink called Cosmos , which is mares milk , is prepared after this manner . They fasten a long line unto 2. posts standing firmly in the ground , & unto the same line they tie the young foies of those mares , which they mean to milk . Then come the dams to stand by their foies gently suffering themselves to be milked . And if any of them be too unruly , then one takes her foie , & puts it under her , letting it suck a while , and presently carrying it away again , there comes another man to milk the said mare . And having got a good quantity of this milk together ( being as sweet as cows milk ) while it is new they pour it into a great bladder or bag , and they beatrice the said bag with a piece of wood made for the purpose , having a club at the lower end like a men head , which is hollow within : and so soon as they beatrice upon it , it begins to boil like new wine , & to be sour and sharp of taste , and they beat it in that manner till butter come thereof . Then taste they thereof , and being indifferently sharp they drink it : for it bites a men tongue like the wine of rasps , when it is drunk . After a man hath taken a draught thereof , it leaveth behind it a taste like the taste of almond milk , and goes down very pleasantly , intoxicating weak brains : also it causeth urine to be avoided in great measure . Likewise Caracosmos , that is to say black Cosmos , for great lords to drink , they make on this manner . First they beatrice the said milk so long till the thickest part thereof descend right down to the bottom like the lees of white wine , and that which is thin and pure remains above , being like unto whay or white must . The said lees or dregs being very white , are given to servants , and will cause them to sleep exceedingly . That which is thin and clear their master's drink : and in very deed it is marvelous 
 240 
 sweet and wholesome liquour . Duke Baatu hath thirty cottages or granges within a days journey of his abiding place : every one of which serves him daily with the Caracosmos of and hundreth mares milk , and so all of them together every day with the milk of 3000. mares , beside white milk which other of his subject's bring . For even as the husbandmen of Syria bestow the third part of their fruits and carry it unto the courts of their lords , even so do they their mares milk every third day . Out of their cows milk they first churn butter , boiling the which butter unto a perfect decoction , they put it into rams skins , which they reserve for the same purpose . Neither do they salt their butter : and yet by reason of the long seething , it putrefieth not : and they keep it in store for winter . The churnmilke which remains of the butter , they let alone till it be as sour as possibly it may be , then they boil it and in boiling , it is turned all into curds , which curds they dry in the sun , making them as hard as the dross of iron : and this kind of food also they store up in satchels against winter . In the winter season when milk faileth them , they put the foresaid curds ( which they call Gry-ut ) into a bladder , and powering hight water thereinto , they beatrice it lustily till they have resolved it into the said water , which is thereby made exceedingly sour , and that they drink in stead of milk . They are very scrupulous , and take diligent heed that they drink not fair water by it self . 
 Of the beasts which they eat , of their garments , and of their manner of hunting . Chap. 7. 
 GReat lords have cottages or granges towards the South , from whence their tenants bring them Millet and meal against winter . The poorer sort provide themselves of such necessaries , for you exchange of rams , & of other beasts skins . The Tartars slaves fill their bellies with thick water , & are therewithal ! contented . They will neither eat mice with long tails , i 241 Q 
 Another strange custom , which I leave to be scanned by falconers themselves . 
 nor any kind of mice with short tails . They have also certain little beasts called by them Sogur , which lie in a cave twenty or thirty of them together , all the whole winter sleeping there for the space of sixe months : and these they take in great abundance . There are also a kind of conies having long tails like unto cats : & on the outside of their tails grow black & white hairs . They have many other small beasts good to eat , which they know and discern right well . I saw no Dear there , & but a few hares , but a great number of Roes . I saw wild asses in great abundance , which be like unto Mules . Also I saw another kind of beast called Artak , having in all resemblance the body of a ram , & crooked homes , which are of such bigness , that I could scarce lift up a pair of them with one hand : & of these homes they make great drinking cups . They have Falcons , Girfalcons , & other hawks in great plenty : all which they carry upon their right hands : 8c they put always about their Falcons necks a string of leather , which hangs down to you midst of their gorges , by the which string , when they cast them off the fist at their game , with their left hand they bow down the heads & breasts of the said hawks , lest they should be tossed up & down , & beaten with the wind , or lest they should soar too high . Wherefore they get a great part of their victuals , by hunting 8c hawking . Concerning their garments and attire be it known unto your Majesty , that out of Cataya 8c other regions of the East , out of Persia also and other countries of the South , there are brought unto them stuffs of silk , cloth of gold , 8c cotton cloth , which they wear in time of summer . But out of Russia , Moxel , Bulgaria the greater , 8c Pascatir , that is Hungaria the greater , and out of Kersis ( all which are Northern regions 8c full of woods ) 8c also out of many other countries of the North , which are subject unto them , the inhabitants bring them rich and costly skins of diverse sorts ( which I never saw in our 
 242 
 1253-countries ) wherewithal they are clad in winter . And always against winter they make themselves two gowns , one with the fur inward to their skin , & another with the fur outward , to defend them from wind & snow , which for the most part are made of wolves skins , or Fox skins , or else of Papions . And when they fit within the house , they have a finer gown to wear . The poorer sort make their upper gown of dogs or of goats skins . When they go to hunt for wild beasts , there meets a great company of them together , & environing the place round about , where they are sure to find some game , by little & little they approach on all sides , till they have got the wild beasts into the midst , as it were into a circle , & then they discharge their arrows at them . Also they make themselves breeches of skins . The rich Tartars sometimes fur their gowns with pelluce or silk shag , which is exceeding soft , light , & warm . The poorer sort do line their clothes with cotton cloth which is made of the finest wool they can pick out , & of the courser part of the said wool , they make felt to cover their houses and their chests , and for their bedding also . Of the same wool , being mixed with one third part of horse hair , they make all their cordage . They make also of the said felt coverings for their stools , and caps to defend Great expense their heads from the weather : for all which purposes efwmU-they spend a great quantity of their wool . And thus much concerning the attire of the men . 
 Of the fashion which the Tartars use in cutting their hair , and of the attire of their women . Chap. 8. 
 THe men shave a plot foure square upon the crowns of their heads , and from the two foremost corners they shave , as it were , two seams down to their temples : they shave also their temples and the hinder part of their head even unto the nape of the neck : likewise they shave the forepart of their scalp down 243 
 to their foreheads , & upon their foreheads they leave a lock of hair reaching down unto their eye brows : upon the two hindermost corners of their heads , they have two locks also , which they twine and braid into knots and so bind and knit them under each ear one . Moreover their women's garments differ not from their men's , saving that they are somewhat longer . But on the morrow after one of their women is married , she shaves her scalp from the midst of her head down to her forehead , & wears a wide garment like unto the hood of a Nun , yea larger and longer in all parts then a Nuns hood , being open before and girded unto them under the right side . For herein do the Tartars differ from the Turkes : because the Turkes fasten their garments to their bodies on the left side : but the Tartars always on the right side . They have also and ornament for their heads which they call Botta , being made of the bark of a tree , or of some such other lighter matter as they can find , which by reason of the thickness & roundness thereof cannot be held but in both hands together : & it hath a square sharp spire rising from the top thereof , being more then a cubit in length , & fashioned like unto a pinnacle . The said Botta they cover all over with a piece of rich silk : & it is hollow within : & upon the midst of the said spire or square top , they put a bunch of quils or of slender canes a cubit long and more : & the said bunch , on the top thereof , they beautify with Peacocks feathers , & round about all the length thereof , with the feathers of a Malards tail , & with precious stones also . Great ladies wear this kind of ornament upon their heads binding it strongly with a certain hat or coif , which hath and hold in the crown , fit for the spire to come through it : & under the foresaid ornament they cover the hairs of their heads , which they gather up round together from the hinder part thereof to the crown , & so lap them up in a knot or bundle within the said Botta , which afterwards they bind strongly under 
 244 
 their throats . Hereupon when a great company of such gentlewomen ride together , and are beheld a far off , they seem to be soldiers with helmets on their heads carrying their lances upright : for the said Botta appears like and helmet with a lance over it . All their women fit on horseback bestriding their horses like men : & they bind their hoods or gowns about their wastes with a sky coloured silk scarf , & with another scarf they gird it above their breasts : & they bind also a piece of white silk like a mufler or mask under their eyes , reaching down unto their breast . These gentlewomen are exceeding fat , & the lesser their noses be , the fairer are they esteemed : they daub over their sweet faces with grease too shamefully : and they never lie in bed for their travel of childbirth . 
 Of the duties enjoined unto the Tartarian women , and of their labours , and also of their marriages . Chap. 9. 
 THe duties of women are , to drive carts : to lay their houses upon carts & to take them down again : to milk kine : to make butter & Gry-ut : to dress skins & to sow them , which they usually sow with thread made of sinews , for they divide sinews into slender threads , & then twine them into one long thread . They make sandals & socks & other garments . Howbeit they never wash any apparel : for they say that God is then angry , & that dreadful thunder will ensue , if washed garments be hanged forth to dry : yea , they beatrice such as wash , & take their garments from them . They are wonderfully afraid of thunder : for in the time of thunder they thrust all strangers out of their houses , & then wrapping themselves in black felt , they lie hidden therein , till the thunder be overpast . They never wash their dishes » or bowls : yea , when their flesh is sodden , they wash the platter wherein it must be put , with scalding hight broth out of the pot , & then pour the said broth into the pot again . They make felt also , & cover their houses therewith . The 
 245 
 duties of the men are to make bows & arrows , stirrups , bridles , and saddles : to built houses & carts , to keep horses : to milk mares : to churn Cosmos and mares milk , & to make bags wherein to put it : they keep camels also & lay burdens upon them . As for sheep & goats they tend and milk them , aswell the men as the women . With sheeps milk thicked & salted they dress and tan their hides . When they will wash their hands or their heads , they fill their mouths full of water , & spouting it into their hands by little and little , they sprinkle their hair & wash their heads therewith . As touching marriages , your Highness is to understand , that no man can have a wife among them till he hath bought her : whereupon sometimes their maids are very stale before they be married , for their parents always keep them till they can sei them . They keep the first and second degrees of consanguinity inviolable , as we do : but they have no regard of the degrees of affinity : for they will marry together , or by succession , two sisters . Their widows marry not at all , for this reason : because they believe , that all who have served them in this life , shall do them service in the life to come also . Whereupon they are persuaded , that every widow after death shall return unto her own husband . And herehence arises and abominable & filthy custom among them , namely that the son marrieth sometimes all his father's wives except his own mother : For the court or house of the father or mother falls by inheritance always to the younger son . Whereupon he is to provide for all his father's wives , because they are part of his inheritance aswell as his father's possessions . And then if he will he uses them for his own wives : for he thinks it no injury or disparagement unto himself , although they return unto his father after death . Therefore when any man hath bargained with another for a maid , the father of the said damosel makes him a feast : in the mean while she fleeth unto some of her kinsfolks to hide her self . Then says her father unto the bridegroom : Lo , my daughter is yours , take 
 246 
 her wheresoever you can find her . Then he and his friends seek for her till they can find her , and having found her he must take her by force and carry her , as it were , violently unto his own house . 
 Of their execution of justice and judgement : and of their death's and burials . Chap. 10. 
 Concerning their laws or their execution of justice , your Majesty is to be advertised , that when two men fight , no third man dare intrude • himself to part them . Yea , the father dare not help his own son . But he that goes by the worst must appeal unto the court of his lord . And whosoever else ofFereth him any violence after appeal , is put to death . But he must go presently without all delay : and he that hath suffered the injury , carrieth him , as it were captive . They punish no man with sentence of death , unless he be taken in the deed doing , or confesses the same . But being accused by the multitude , they put him unto extreme torture to make him confess the truth . They punish murder with death , and carnali copulation also with any other beside his own . By his own , I mean his wife or his maid servant , for he may use his slave as he lists himself . Heinous theft also or felony they punish with death . For a light theft , as namely for stealing of a ram , the party ( not being apprehended in the deed doing , but otherwise detected ) is cruelly beaten . And if you executioner lays on and 100. strokes , he must have and 100. staves , namely for such as are beaten upon sentence given in the court . Also counterfeit messengers , because they feign themselves to be messengers , when as indeed they are none at all , they punish with death . Sacrilegious persons they use in like manner ( of which kind of malefactors your Majesty shall understand more fully hereafter ) because they esteem such to be witches . When any man dieth , they lament & howl most pitifully for him : & the said mourners are free from paying any tribute for one whole year after . Also whosoever is present at the house 
 247 
 where any one grown to men estate lies dead , he must not enter into the court of Mangu-Can till one whole year be expired . If it were a child deceased he must not enter into the said court till the next month after . Near unto the grave of the party deceased they always leave one cottage . If any of their nobles ( being of the stock of Chingis , who was their first lord & father ) deceaseth , his sepulcher is unknown . And always about those places where they inter their nobles , there is one house of men to keep the sepulchers . I could not learn that they use to hide treasures in the graves of their dead . The Comanians built a great tomb over their dead , & erect the image of the dead party thereupon , with his face towards the East , holding a drinking cup in his hand , before his navel . They erect also upon the monuments of rich men , Pyramids , that is to say , little sharp houses or pinnacles : & in some places I saw mighty towers made of brick , in other places Pyramides made of stones , albeit there are no stones to be found thereabouts . I saw one newly buried , in whose behalf they hanged up 16. horse hides , unto each quarter of the world 4 , between certain high posts : & they set beside his grave Cosmos for him to drink , & flesh to eat : & yet they said that he was baptised . I beheld other kinds of sepulchers also towards the East : namely large flowers or pavements made of stone , some round & some square , & then 4. long stones pitched upright , about the said pavement towards the 4. regions of the world . When any man is sick , he lies in his bed , & causeth a sign to be set upon his house , to signify that there lies a sick person there , to the end that no man may enter into the said house : whereupon none at all visit any sick party but his servant only . Moreover , when any one is sick in their great courts , they appoint watchmen to stand round about the said court , who will not suffer any person to enter within the precincts thereof . For they fear least evil spirits or winds should come together with the parties that enter in . They esteem of soothsayers , as of their priests . 
 248 
 Of our first entrance among the Tartars , and of their ingratitude . Chap. 11. 
 A Nd being come among those barbarous people , me thought ( as I said before ) y‘ I was entered into a new world : for they came flocking about us on horse back , after they had made us a long time to await for them sitting in the shadow , under their black carts . The first question which they demanded was whither we had ever been with them heretofore , or no ? And giving them answer that we had not , they began impudently to beg our victuals from us . And we gave them some of our biscuit & wine , which we had brought with us from the town of Soldaia . And having drunk off - one flagon of our wine they demanded another , saying , that a man goes not into the house with one foot . Howbeit we gave them no more , excusing our selves that we had but a little . Then they asked us , whence we came , & whither we were bound ? I answered them with the words above mentioned : that we had herd concerning duke Sartach , that he was become a Christian , & that unto him our determination was to travel , having your Majesties letters to deliver unto him . They were very inquisitive to know whither I came of mine own accord , or whither I were sent ? I answered that no man compelled me to come , neither had I come , unies I my self had been willing : & that therefore I was come according to mine own will , & to the will of my superior . I took diligent heed never to say that I was your Majesties ambassador . Then they asked what I had in my carts ; whither it were gold or silver , or rich garments to carry unto Sartach ? I answered that Sartach should see what we had brought , when we were once come unto him , & that they had nothing to do to ask such questions , but rather ought to conduct me unto their captain , and that he , if he thought good , should cause me to be directed unto Sartach : if not , that I would return . For there was in the same province one of Baatu his kinsmen called Scacati , unto whom my lord 249 
 the Emperor of Constantinople had written letters of request , to suffer me to pass through his territory . With this answer of ours they were satisfied , giving us horses & oxen , & two men to conduct us . Howbeit before they would allow us the foresaid necessaries for our journey , they made us to await a long while , begging our bred for their young brats , wondering at all things which they saw about our servants , as their knives , gloves , purses , & points , and desiring to have them . I excused my self that we had a long way to travel , & that we must in no wise so soon deprive our selves of things necessary , to finish so long a journey . Then they said that I was a very varlet . True it is , that they took nothing by force from me : howbeit they will beg that which they see very importunately & shamelessly . And if a man bestow ought upon them , it is but cost lost , for they are thankless wretches . They esteem themselves lords & think y* nothing should be denied them by any man . If a man gives them nought , & afterwards stands in need of their service , they will do right nought for him . They gave us of their cows milk to drink after you butter was cherned out of it , being very sour , which they call Apram . And so we departed from them . And in very deed it seemed to me y‘ we were escaped out of the hands of devils . On the morrow we were come unto the captain . From the time wherein we departed from Soldaia , till we arrived at the court of Sartach , which was the space of two months , we never lay in house or tent , but always under the starry canopy , & in the open air , or under our carts . Neither yet saw we any village , nor any mention of building where a village had been , but the graves of the Comanians in great abundance . The same evening our guide which had conducted us , gave us some Cosmos . After I had drunk thereof I sweat most extremely for the novelty and strangeness , because I never drank of it before . Notwithstanding me thought it was very savoury , as indeed it was .

 Of the court of Scacatai : and how the Christians drink no Cosmos . Chap. 12. 
 ON the morrow after we met with the carts of Scacatai laden with houses , and me thought that a mighty city came to meet me . I wondered also at the great multitude of huge droves of oxen , & horses , and at the flocks of sheep . I could see but a few men that guided all these matters : whereupon I inquired how many men he had under him , & they told me that he had not above 500. in all , the one half of which number we were come passed , as they lay in another lodging . Then the servant which was our guide told me , that I must present somewhat unto Scacatay : & so he caused us to stay , going himself before to give notice of our coming . By this time it was passed three of the clock , and they unladed their houses never unto a certain water : And there came unto us his interpreter , who being advertised by us that we were never there before , demanded some of our victuals , & we yielded unto his request . Also he required of us some garment for a reward , because he was to interpret our sayings unto his master . Howbeit we excused our selves as well as we could . Then he asked us , what we would present unto his Lord ? And we took a flagon of wine , & filled a maund with biscuit , & a platter with apples & other fruits . But he was not contented therewith , because we brought him not some rich garment . Notwithstanding we entered so into his presence with fear and bashfulness . He sat upon his bed holding a citron in his hand , and his wife sat by him : who ( as I verily think ) had cut and pared her nose between the eyes , that she might seem to be more flat and saddle-nosed : for she had left her self no nose at all in that place , having anointed the very same place with a black ointment , and her eye brows also : which sighed seemed most ugly in our eyes . Then I rehearsed unto him the same words , which I had spoken in other places before . For it stood us in hand to use one and the same speech in all places . For 251 
 A caveat right we were well forewarned of this circumstance by some worthy the which had been among the Tartars , that we should never vary in our tale . Then I besought him , that he would vouchsafe to accept that small gift at our hands , excusing my self that I was a Monk , and that it was against our profession to possess gold , or silver , or precious garments , and therefore that I had not any such thing to give him , howbeit he should receive some part of our victuals in stead of a blessing . Hereupon he caused our present to be received , and immediately distributed the same among his men , who were met together for the same purpose , to drink and make merry . I delivered also unto Him the Emperor of Constantinople his letters ( this was eight days after the feast of Ascension ) who sent them forthwith to Soldaia to have them interpreted there : for they were written in Greek , and he had none about him that was skilful in the Greek tongue . He asked us also whither we would drink any Cosmos , that is to say mares milk ? ( For those that are Christians among them , as namely the Russians , Grecians , and Alanians , who keep their own law very strictly , will in no case drink thereof , yea , they account themselves no Christians after they have once drunk of it , & their priests reconcile them unto the Church as if they had renounced the Christian faith . ) I gave him answer , that we had as yet sufficient of our own to drink , and that when our drink failed us , we must be constrained to drink such as should be given unto us . He inquired also what was contained in our letters , which your Majesty sent unto Sartach ? I answered : that they were sealed up , and that there was nothing contained in them , but good and friendly words . And he asked what words we would deliver unto Sartach ? I answered : the words of Christian faith . He asked again what these words were ? For he was very desirous to hear them . 
 [ I . i O2 . J Then 1 expounded unto him as well as I could , by mine 
 interpreter , ( who had no wit nor any utterance of speech ) the Apostles creed . Which after he had herd , holding his peace , he shook his head . Then he assigned unto us 252 
 two men , who should give attendance upon our selves , upon our horses , and upon our Oxen. And he caused us to ride in his company , till the messenger whom he had sent for the interpretation of the Emperors letters , was returned . And so we traveled in his company till the morrow after Pentecost . 
 How the Alanians came unto us on Pentecost or Whitson even . Chap. 13. 
 UPon the even of Pentecost , there came unto us certain Alanians , who are there called * Acias , being Christians after the manner of the Grecians , using greek books and Grecian priests : howbeit they are not schismatics as the Grecians are , but without acception of persons , they honour all Christians . And they brought unto us sodden flesh , requesting us to eat of their meat , and to pray for one of their company being dead . Then I said , because it was the even of so great and so solemn a feast day , that we would not eat any flesh for that time . And I expounded unto them the solemnity of the said feast , whereat they greatly rejoiced : for they were ignorant of all things aPPERTAINING to Christian religion , except only the name of Christ . They and many other Christians , both Russians , and Hungarians demanded of us , whither they might be saved or no , because they were constrained to drink Cosmos , & to eat the dead carcases of such things , as were slain by the Saracens , and other infidels ? Which even the Greek & Russian priests themselves also esteem as things strangled or offered unto idols : because they were ignorant of the times of fasting , neither could they have observed them albeit they had known them . Then instructed I them aswell as I could and strengthened them in the faith . As for the flesh which they had brought we reserved it until the feast day . For there was nothing to be sold among the Tartars for gold & silver , but only for cloth and garments , of the which kind of merchandise we had none at all . When our servants offered them any coin called Yperpera , they 253 
 * 0r , Akas . 
 Cloth is the chief merchandise in Tartaric . 
 rubbed it with their fingers , and put it unto their noses , to try by the smell whither it were copper or no . Neither did they allow us any food but cows milk only which was very sour & filthy . There was one thing most necessary greatly wanting unto us . For the water was so foul and muddy by reason of their horses , that it was not meet to be drunk . And but for certain biscuit , which was by the goodness of God remaining unto us , we had undoubtedly perished . 
 Of a Saracen which said that he would be baptised : and of certain men which seemed to be lepers . Chap. 14. 
 UPon the day of Pentecost there came unto us a certain Saracen , unto whom , as he talked with us , we expounded the Christian faith . Who ( hearing of Gods benefits exhibited unto mankind by the incarnation of our Saviour Christ , and the resurrection of the dead , & the judgement to come , & that in baptism was a washing away of sins ) said , that he would be baptised . But when we prepared our selves to the baptizing of him , he suddenly mounted on horseback , saying that he would go home and consult with his wife what were best to be done . And on the morrow after he told us , that he durst in no case receive baptism , because then he should drink no more Cosmos . For the Christians of that place affirm that no true Christians ought to drink thereof : and that without the said liquour he could not live in that desert . From which opinion , I could not for my life remove him . Wherefore be it known of a certainty unto your highness , that they are much estranged from the Christian faith by reason of that opinion which hath been broached & confirmed among them by the Russians , of whom there is a great multitude in that place . The same day Scacatay the captain aforesaid gave us one man to conduct us to Sartach , and two other to guide us unto the next lodging , which was distant from that 
 254 
 place five days journey for oxen to travel . They gave unto us also a goat for victuals , and a great many bladders of cows milk , 8c but a little Cosmos , because it is of so great estimation among them . And so taking our journey directly towards the North , me thought that we had passed through one of hell gates . The servants which conducted us began to play the bold thieves with us , seeing us take so little heed unto our selves . At length having lost much by their thievery , harm taught us wisdom . And then we came unto the extremity of that province , which is fortified with a ditch from one sea unto another : without the bounds whereof their lodging was situate . Into the which , so soon as we had entered , all the inhabitants there seemed unto us to be infected with leprosy : for certain base fellows were placed there to receive tribute of all such as took salt out of the salt Salt pits . pits aforesaid . From that place they told us that we must travel fifteen days journey , before we should find any other people . With them we drank Cosmos , and gave unto them a basket full of fruits and of biscuit . And they gave unto us eight oxen and one goat , to sustain us in so great a journey , and I know not how many bladders of milk . And so changing our oxen , ? en we took our journey which we finished in tenne J°urneD-dayes , arriving at another lodging : neither found we any water all that way , but only in certain ditches made in the valleys , except two small rivers . And from the time wherein we departed out of the foresaid province of Gasaria , we travailed directly Eastward , having a Sea on the South side of us , and a waste desert on the North , which desert , in some places , reaches twenty days journey in breadth , and there is neither tree , mountain , nor stone therein . And it is most excellent pasture . Here the Comanians , which were called Capthac , were wont to feed their cattle . Howbeit by the Dutch men they are called Valani , and the province it self Valania . But Isidore calls all that 
 2S5 
 The length of tract of land stretching from the river of Tanais to the Comania . lake of Maeotis , and so along as far as Danubius , the country of Alania . And the same land continueth in length from Danubius unto Tanais ( which divides Asia from Europe ) for the space of two months journey , albeit a man should ride post as fast as the Tartars use to ride : and it was all over inhabited by the Comanians , called Capthac : yea and beyond Tanais , as far as the river of Edil or Volga : the space between the two which rivers is a great and long 
 Russia . journey to be travailed in ten days . To the North of the same province lies Russia , which is full of wood in all places , and stretcheth from Polonia and Hungaria , even to the river of Tanais : and it hath be wasted all over by the Tartars , and as yet is daily wasted by them .

 Prussia . ' | ' Heigh prefer the Saracens before the Russians , A because they are Christians , and when they are able to give them no more gold nor silver , they drive them and their children like flocks of sheep into the wilderness , constraining them to keep their cattle there . Beyond Russia lies the country of Prussia , which the Dutch knights of the order of Saint Maries hospitali of Jerusalem have of late wholly conquered and subdued . And in very deed they might easily win Russia , if they would put to their helping hand . For if the Tartars should but once know , that the great Priest , that is to say , the Pope did cause the ensign of the cross to be displayed against them , they would flee all into their desert and solitary places . We therefore went on towards the East , seeing nothing but heaven and earth , and sometime the sea on our right hand , called the Sea of Tanais , and the sepulchres of the Comanians , which appeared unto us two leagues off , in which places they were wont to bury their kindred 256 
 altogether . So long as we were traveling through the desert , it went reasonably well with us . For I cannot sufficiently express in words the irksome and tedious troubles which I sustained , when I came at any of their places of abided . For our guide would have us go in unto every Captain with a present , and our expenses would not extend so far . For we were every day eight persons of us spending our wayfaring provision , for the Tartars servants would all of them eat of our victuals . We our selves were five in number , and the servants our guides were three , two to drive our carts , and one to conduct us unto Sartach . The flesh which they gave us was not sufficient for us : neither could we find any thing to be bought for our money . And as we sat Extreme heat under our carts in the code shadow , by reason of the tn Sommer-extreame and vehement heat which was there at that time , they did so importunately and shamelessly intrude themselves into our company , that they would even tread upon us , to see whatsoever things we had . Having list at any time to ease themselves , the filthy lozels had not the manners to withdraw themselves farther from us , then a bean can be cast . Yea , like vile slovens they would lay their tails in our presence , while they were yet talking with us : many other things they committed , which were most tedious and loathsome unto us . But above all things it grieved me to the very heart , that when I would utter ought unto them , which might tend to their edification , my foolish interpreter would say : you shall not make me become a Preacher now : I tell you , I cannot nor I will not rehearse any such words . And true it was which he said , For I perceived afterwards , when I began to have a little smattering in the language , that when I spoke one thing , he would say quite another , whatsoever came next unto his witless tongues end . Then seeing the danger I might incur in speaking by such and interpreter , I resolved much rather to hold my peace , and thus we traveled with great toil from lodging to lodging , till at the length , 
 I 257 R 
 The breadth of Tanais . 
 He is much deceived . 
 a few days before the feast of Saint Marry Magdalene , we arrived at the bank of the mighty river Tanais which divides Asia from Europa , even as the river Nilus of . / Egypt disjoineth Asia from Africa . At the same place where we arrived , Baatu and Sartach did cause a certain cottage to be built , upon the Eastern bank of the river , for a company of Russians to dwell in to the end they might transport Ambassadors and merchant's in ferry-boats over that part of the river . First they ferried us over , and then our carts , putting one wheel into one lyter , and the other wheel into another lyter , having bound both the lyters together , and so they rowed them over . In this place our guide played the fool most extremely . For he imagining that the said Russians , dwelling in the cottage , should have provided us horses , sent home the beasts which we brought with us , in another cart , y‘ they might return unto their own master's . And when we demanded to have some beasts of them , they answered , that they had a privilege from Baatu , whereby they were bound to none other service , but only to ferry over goers & comers : and that they received great tribute of merchants in regard thereof . We stayed therefore by the said rivers side three days . The first day they gave unto us a great fresh turbut : the second day they bestowed rye bred , and a little flesh upon us , which the purveyor of the village had taken up at every house for us : and the third day dried fish , which they have there in great abundance . The said river was even as broad in that place , as the river of Sein is at Paris . And before we came there , we passed over many goodly waters , and full of fish : howbeit the barbarous and rude Tartars know not how to take them : neither do they make any reckoning of any fish , except it be so great , that they may pray upon the flesh thereof , as upon the flesh of a ram . This river is the limit of the East part of Russia , and it springs out of the fens of Maeotis , which fens stretch unto the North Ocean . And it runneth South - 
 258 
 ward into a certain great sea 700. miles about , before it falls into the sea called Pontus Euxinus . And all the rivers , which we passed over , ran with full stream into those quarters . The foresaid river hath great store of wood also growing upon the West side thereof . Beyond this place the Tartars ascend no farther unto the North : for at that season of the year , about the first of August , they begin to return back unto the South . And therefore there is another cottage somewhat lower , where passengers are ferried over in Winter time . And in this place we were driven to great extremity , by reason that we could get neither horses , nor oxen for any money . At length , after I had declared unto them , that my coming was to labour for the common good of all Christians , they sent us oxen & men ; howbeit we our selves were feign to travel on foot . At this time they were reaping their rye . Wheat prospereth not well in that soil . They have the seed of Millium in great abundance . The Russian women attire their heads like unto our women . They imbroder their safeguards or gowns on the outside , from their feet unto their knees with particoloured or gray stuff . The Russian men wear caps like unto the Dutch men . Also they wear upon their heads certain sharp , & high-crowned hats made of felt , much like unto a sugar loaf . Then traveled we 3. dales together , not finding any people . And when our selves and our oxen were exceeding weary and faint , not knowing how far off we should find any Tartars , on the sudden , there came two horses running towards us , which we took with great joy , and our guide and interpreter mounted upon their backs , to see , how far off they could descry any people . At length upon the fourth day of our journey , having found some inhabitants , we rejoiced like seafaring men , which had escaped out of a dangerous tempest , and had newly recovered the haven . Then having taken fresh horses , and oxen , we passed on from lodging to lodging , till at the last , upon the

 second of the Kalends of August , we arrived at the habitation of Duke Sartach himself . 
 Of the dominion of Sartach , and of his Subject's . Chap. 16. 
 THe region lying beyond Tanais , is a very goodly country , having store of rivers and woods towards the North part thereof . There be mighty huge woods which two sorts of people do inhabit . One of them is called Moxel , being mere Pagans , and without law . They have neither towns nor cities , but only cottages in you woods . Their lord & a great part of themselves were put to the sword in high Germanie . Whereupon they highly commend the brave courage of the Almans , hoping as yet to be delivered out of the bondage of the Tartars , by their means . If any merchant come unto them , he must provide things necessary for him , with whom he is first of all entertained , all the time of his abided among them . If any lies with another men wife , her husband , unless he be and eiewitnes thereof , regardeth it not : for they are not jealous over their wives . They have abundance of hogs , and great store of honey & wax , and diverse sorts of rich & costly skins , and plenty of falcons . Next unto them are other people called Merclas , which the Latines call Merdui , and they are Saracens . Beyond them is the river of Etilia or Volga , which is the mightiest river that ever I saw . And it issueth from the North part of Bulgaria the greater , & so trending along Southward , disimboqueth into a certain lake containing in circuit the space of 4. months travel , whereof I will speak hereafter . The two foresaid rivers , namely Tanais & Etilia , otherwise called Volga , towards the Northern regions through the which we traveled , are not distant asunder above x . days journey , but Southward they are divided a great space one from another . For Tanais descendeth into the sea of Pontus : Etilia makes the foresaid sea or lake , with the help of many 
 260 
 other rivers which fall thereinto out of Persia . And we had to the South of us huge high mountains , upon the sides whereof , towards the said desert , do the people called Cergis , and the Alani or Acas inhabit , who are Ker&s or as yet Christians , & wage war against the Tartars . Aas-Beyond them , next unto the sea or lake of Etilia , there are certain Saracens called Lesgi , who are in subjection unto the Tartars . Beyond these is Porta ca ferrea , or the iron gate , now called Derbent , which Alexander built to exclude the barbarous nations out of Persia . Concerning the situation whereof , your majesty shall understand more about the end of this Treatise : for I travailed in my return by the very same place . Between the two foresaid rivers , in the ’ 
 regions through the which we passed did the Comanians of old time inhabit , before they were overrun by the Tartars . 
 Of the Court of Sartach , and of the magnificence thereof . Chap. 17. 
 A Nd we found Sartach lying within three days journey of the river Etilia : whose Court seemed unto us to 
 be very great . For he himself had sixe wives , and his eldest son also had three wives : every one of which women hath a great house , & they have each one of them about 200. carts . Our guide went unto a certain Nestorian nam Coiat , who is a man of great authority Calat the in Sartachs Court . He made us to go very far unto Nestorian . the Lords gate . For so they call him , who hath the office of entertaining Ambassadors . In the evening Coiac commanded us to come unto him . Then our guide began to inquire what we would present him withal , & was exceedingly offended , when he saw that we had nothing ready to present . We stood before him , and he sat majestically , having music and dancing in his presence . Then I spoke unto him in the words before recited , telling him , for what purpose I was come unto his lord , and requesting so much 
 261 
 favour at his hands , as to bring our letters unto the sighed of his Lord . I excused my self also , that I was a Monk , not having , nor receiving , nor using any gold , or silver , or any other precious thing , save only our books , and the vestments wherein we served God : and that this was the cause why I brought no present unto him , nor unto his Lord . For I that had abandoned mine own goods , could not be a transporter of things for other men . Then he answered very courteously , that being a Monk , and so doing , I did well : for so I should observe my vow : neither did himself stand in need of ought that we had , but rather was ready to bestow upon us such things as we our selves stood in need of : and he caused us to fit down , and to drink of his milk . And presently after he requested us to say our devotions for him : and we did so . He inquired also who was the greatest Prince among the Franckes ? And I said , the Emperor , if he could enjoy his own dominions in quiet . No ( quoth he ) but the king of France . For he had herd of your Highness by lord Baldwine of Henault . I found there also one of the Knights of the Temple , who had be in Cyprus , and had made report of all things which he saw there . Then returned we unto our lodging . And on the morrow we sent him a flagon of Muscadel wine ( which had lasted very well in so long a journey ) and a box full of biscuit , which was most acceptable unto him . And he kept our servants with him for that evening . The next morning he commanded me to come unto the Court , and to bring the kings letters and my vestiments , and books with me : because his Lord was desirous to see them . Which we did accordingly , lading one cart with our books and vestments , and another with biscuit , wine , and fruits . Then he caused all our books and vestments to be laid forth . And there stood round about us many Tartars , Christians and Saracens on horseback . At the sighed whereof , he demanded whither 
 262 
 I would bestow all those things upon his Lord or no ? Which saying made me to tremble , and grieved me full soar . Howbeit , dissembling our grief as well as we could , we shaped him this answer : Sir , our humble request is , that our Lord your master would vouchsafe to accept our bred , wine , and fruits , not as a present , because it is too mean , but as a benediction , lest we should come with and empty hand before him . And he shall see the letters of my sovereign Lord the king , and by them he shall understand for what cause we are come unto him , and then both our selves , and all that we have , shall stand to his courtesy : for our vestments be holy , and it is unlawful for any but Priests to touch them . Then he commanded us to invest our selves in the said garments , that we might go before his Lord : and we did so . Then I my self putting on our most precious ornaments , took in mine arms a very fair cushion , and the Bible which your Majesty gave me , and a most beautiful Psalter , which the Queens Grace bestowed upon me , wherein there were goodly pictures . Mine associate took a missal and a cross : and the clerk having put on his surplesse , took a censer in his hand . And so we came unto the presence of his Lord : and they lifted up the felt hanging before his door , that he might behold us . Then they caused the clerk and the interpreter thrice to bow the knee : but of us they required no such submission . And they diligently admonished us to take heed , that in going in , and in coming out , we touched not the threshold of the house , and requested us to sing a benediction for him . Then we entered in , singing Salve Regina . And within the entrance of the door , stood a bench with cosmos , and drinking cups thereupon . And all his wives were there assembled . Also the Moals or rich Tartars thrusting in with us pressed us soar . Then Coiat carried unto his lord the censer with incense , which he beheld very diligently , holding it in his hand . Afterwards he carried the Psalter 263 
 unto him , which he looked earnestly upon , and his wife also that sat beside him . After that he carried the Bible : then Sartach asked if the Gospel were contained therein ? Yea ( said I ) and all the holy scriptures beside . He took the cross also in his hand , and demanded concerning the image , whither it were the image of Christ or no ? I said it was . The Nestorians & the Armenians do never make the figure of Christ upon their crosses . Wherefore either they seem not to think well of his passion , or else they are ashamed of it . Then he caused them that stood about us , to stand aside , that he might more fully behold our ornaments . Afterwards I delivered unto him your Majesties letters , with the translation thereof into the Arabic , & Syriake languages . For I caused them to be translated at Aeon into the character , & dialect of both the said tongues . And there were certain Armenian priests , which had skill in the Turkish & Arabian languages . The aforesaid knight also of the order of the Temple had knowledge in the Syriake , Turkish , & Arabian tongues . Then we departed forth , and put off our vestments , and there came unto us certain Scribes together with the foresaid Coiat , & caused our letters to be interpreted . Which letters being herd , he caused our bred , wine and fruits to be received . And he permitted us also to carry our vestments and books unto our own lodging . This was done upon the feast of S. Peter ad vincula . 
 How they were given in charge to go unto Baatu the Father of Sartach . Chap. 18. 
 THe next morning betimes came unto us a certain Priest , who was brother unto Coiat , requesting to have our box of Chrism , because Sartach ( as he said ) was desirous to see it : and so we gave it him . About eventide Coiat sent for us , saying : My lord your king wrote good words unto my lord and master Sartach . Howbeit there are certain matters of difficulty in them concerning which he dare not determine ought , without 264 
 the advice and counsel of his father . And therefore of necessity you must depart unto his father , leaving behind you the two carts , which you brought hither yesterday with vestments and books , in my custody : because my lord is desirous to take more diligent view thereof . I presently suspecting what mischief might ensue by his covetousness , said unto him : Sir , we will not only leave those with you , but the two other carts also , which we have in our possession , will we commit unto your custody . You shall not ( quoth he ) leave those behind you , but for the other two carts first nam , we will satisfy your request . I said that this could not conveniently be done : but needs we must leave all with him . Then he asked , whither we meant to tarry in the land ? I answered : If you thoroughly understand the letters of my lord the king , you know that we are even so determined . Then he replied , that we ought to be patient and lowly : and so we departed from him that evening . On the morrow after he sent a Nestorian Priest for the carts , and we caused all the foure carts to be delivered . Then came the foresaid brother of Coiat to meet us , and separated all those things , which we had brought the day before unto the Court , from the rest , namely , the books and vestments , and took them away with him . Howbeit Coiat had commanded , that we should carry those vestments with us , which we beware in the presence of Sartach , that we might put them on before Baatu , if need should require : but the said Priest took them from us by violence , saying : thou hast brought them unto Sartach , and wouldst thou carry them unto Baatu ? And when I would have rendered a reason , he answered : be not too talkative , but go your ways . Then I saw that there was no remedy but patience : for we could have no access unto Sartach himself , neither was there any other , that would do us justice . I was afraid also in regard of the interpreter , lest he had spoken other things then I said unto him : for his will was good that we should have given away all

 that we had . There was yet one comfort remaining unto me : for when I once perceived their covetous intent , I conveyed from among our books the Bible , and the sentences , and certain other books which I made speciali account of . Howbeit I durst not take away the Psalter of my sovereign Lady the Queen , because it was too well known , by reason of the golden pictures therein . And so we returned with the two other carts unto our lodging . Then came he that was appointed to be our guide unto the court of Baatu , willing us to take our journey in all posthaste : unto whom I said , that I would in no case have the carts to go with me . Which thing he declared unto Coiat . Then Coiat commanded , that we should leave them and our servant with him : And we did as he commanded . And so traveling directly Eastward towards Baatu , the third day we came to Etilia or Volga : the streams whereof when I beheld , I wondered from what regions of the North such huge and mighty waters should descend . Before we were departed from Sartach , the foresaid Coiat , with many other Scribes of the court said unto us : do not make 
 report that our Lord is a Christian , but a Moal . Because the name of a Christian seems unto them to be the name of some nation . So great is their pride , that albeit they believe perhaps some things concerning Christ , yet will they not be called Christians , being desirous that their own name , that is to say , Moal should be exalted above all other names . Neither will

Whereupon their princes are called Can , because that unto them belongeth the government of the people by divination . we do read also in the historic of Antiochia , that the Turkes sent for aid against the French-men , unto the kingdom of Con Can . For out of those parts the whole nation of From whence the Turkes first came . The said Con was of the nation Turks of Kara-Catay . Kara signifies black , and Catay is the Frst sPran&-name of a country . So that Kara-Catay signifies the black Catay . This name was given to make a difference between the foresaid people , and the people of Catay , inhabiting Eastward over against you Ocean sea : con - And Ocean sea . cerning whom your majesty shall understand more hereafter . These Catayans dwelled upon certain Alpes , by the which I travailed . And in a certain plain country within those Alpes , there inhabited a Nestorian shepherd , being a mighty governor over the people called Yayman , Nayman . which were Christians , following the sect of Nestorius . 
 After the death of Con Can , the said Nestorian exalted 
 himself to the kingdom , and they called him King John , reporting ten times more of him then was true . For so the Nestorians which come out of those parts , use to do . For they blaze abroad great rumours , and reports upon just nothing . Whereupon they gave out concerning Sartach , that he was become a Christian , and the like also they reported concerning Mangu Can , and Ken Can : namely because these Tartars make more account of Christians , then they do of other people , and yet in very deed , themselves are not Christians . So likewise there went forth a great report concerning the said king John. Howbeit , when I travailed along by his territories , there was no man that knew any thing of him , but only a few Nestorians . In his pastures or territories dwells Ken Can , at whose Court Frier Andrew was . And I my self passed by it at my return . This John had a brother , being a mighty man also , and a shepherd like himself , called Vut , and he inhabited beyond the Alpes of Cara Catay , being 267 
 Presbyter John. 
 The place of Ken Kan his abode . 
 Vut Can , or Une Can . 
 distant from his brother John , the space of three weeks The village of journey . He was lord over a certain village , called Cara ( Crh^rUm Carum , having people also for his subject's , nam Crit , or 
 Merkit , who were Christians of the sect of Nestorius . But their Lord abandoning the worship of Christ , followed after idols , retaining with him Priests of the said idols , who all of them are worshippers of devils and sorcerers . Beyond his pastures some tenne or Moal in aid fifteene days journey , were the pastures of Moal , who y were a poor and beggarly nation , without governor , 
 and without Law , except their soothsayings , and their divinations , unto the which detestable studies , all in The place of those parts do apply their minds . Near unto the Tartan . MoaJ were other poor people called Tartars . The 
 foresaid king John died without issue male , and thereupon his brother Vut was greatly enriched , and caused himself to be nam Can : and his droves and flocks ranged even unto the borders of Moal . About the Cyngis . same time there was one Cyngis , a black smith among the people of Moal . This Cyngis stole as many cattle from Vut Can , as he could possibly get : insomuch that the shepherds of Vut complained unto their Lord . Then provided he and army , and marched up into the country of Moal to seek for the said Cyngis . But Cyngis fled among the Tartars , and hid himself amongst them . And Vut having taken some spoils both from Moal , and also from the Tartars , returned home . Then spoke Cyngis unto the Tartars , and unto the people of Moal , saying : Sirs , because we are destitute of a governor and Captain , you see how our neighbours do oppress us . And the Tartars and Moals appointed him to be their Chieftain . Then having secretly gathered together and army , he brake in suddenly upon Vut , and overcame him , and Vut fled into Cataya . At the same time was the daughter of Vut taken , which Cyngis married unto one of his sons , by whom she conceived , & brought forth the great Mangu-Can . Can , which now reigneth , called Mangu-Can . Then 268 
 Cyngis sent you Tartars before him in all places where he came : and thereupon was their name published and spread abroad : for in all places the people would cry out : Lo , the Tartars come , the Tartars come . Howbeit , through continual ! wars , they are now , all of them in a manner , consumed and brought to nought . Whereupon the Moals endeavour what they can , to extinguish the name of the Tartars , that they may exalt their own name . The country wherein they first inhabited , and where the Court of Cyngis Can as yet remains , is called Mancherule . But because Tartaria Mancheruk . is the region , about which they have obtained their conquests , they esteem that as their royal and chief city , and there for the most part do they elect their great Can . 
 Of the Russians , Hungarians , and Alanians : and of the Caspian Sea. Chap. 20. 
 NOw , as concerning Sartach , whither he believes in Christ , or no , I know not . This I am sure of , that he will not be called a Christian . Yea rather he seems unto me to deride and skofle at Christians . He lies in the way of the Christians , as namely of the Russians , the Valacfiians , the Bulgarians of Bulgaria the lesser , the Soldaianes , the Kerkis , and the Alanians : who all of them pass by him , as they are going to the Court of his father Baatu , to carry gifts : whereupon he is more in league with them . Howbeit , if the Saracens come , and bring greater gifts then they , they are dispatched sooner . He hath about him certain Nestorian Priests , who pray upon their beads , and sing their devotions . Also , there is another under Baatu called Berta , who feeds his cattle towards Porta Or , Berea . ferrea , or Derbent , where lies the passage of all those Saracens , which come out of Persia , and out of Turkey to go unto Baatu , and passing by , they give rewards unto him . And he professes himself to be a Saracen , and will not permit swines flesh to be eaten in his dominions . 
 269 
 Howbeit , at the time of our return , Baatu commanded him to remove himself from that place , and to inhabit upon the East side of Volga : for he was unwilling that the Saracens messengers should pass by the said Berta , because he saw it was not for his profit . For the space of foure days while we remained in the court of Sartach , we had not any victuals at all allowed us , but once only a little Cosmos . And in our journey between him and his father , we traveled in great fear . For certain Russians , Hungarians , and Alanians being servants unto the Tartars ( of whom they have great multitudes among them ) assemble themselves twentie or thirtie in a company , and so secretly in the night conveying themselves from home , they take bows and arrows with them , and whomsoever they find in the night season , they put him to death , hiding themselves in the day time . And having tired their horses , they go in the night unto a company of other horses feeding in some pasture , and change them for new , taking with them also one or two horses beside , to eat them when they stand in need . Our guide therefore was soar afraid , lest we should have met with such companions . In this journey we had died for famine , had we not carried some of our biscuit with us . At length we came unto the mighty river of Etilia , or Volga . For it is foure times greater , then the river of Sein , and of a wonderful depth : and issuing forth of Bulgaria the greater , it runneth into a certain lake or sea , which of late they call the Hircan sea , according to the name of a certain city in Persia , standing upon the shore thereof . Howbeit Isidore calls it the Caspian sea . For it hath the Caspian mountains and the land of Persia situate on the South side thereof : and the mountains of Musihet , that is to say , of the people called Assassini towards the East , which mountains are conjoined unto the Caspian mountains : but on the North side thereof lies the same desert , wherein the Tartars do now inhabit . Howbeit heretofore there dwelled certain 
 270 
 I253-people called Changlae . And on that side it receives ChangLe . the streams of Etilia ; which river increases in Summer time , like unto the river Nilus in . / Egypt . Upon the West part thereof , it hath the mountains of Alani , and Lesgi , and Porta ferrea , or Derbent , and the mountains of Georgia . This Sea therefore is compassed in on three sides with the mountains , but on the North side with plain ground . Frier Andrew , in his journey traveled Frier round about two sides thereof , namely the South and the Andrew East sides : and I my self about other two , that is to say , the North side in going from Baatu to Mangu-Can , and in returning likewise : and the West side in coming home from Baatu into Syria . A man may travel round about it in foure months . And it is not true which Isidore reporteth , namely that this Sea is a bay or gulf coming forth of the Ocean : for it doth , in no part thereof , join with the Ocean , but is environed on all sides with land . 
 Of the court of Baatu : and how we were entertained by him . Chap. 21. 
 ALL the region extending from the West shore of the foresaid sea , where Alexanders Iron gate , otherwise called the city of Derbent , is situate , and from the mountains of Alania , all along by the fens of Maeotis , whereinto the river of Tanais falls , and so forth , to the North Ocean , was wont to be called The North Albania . Of which country Isidore reporteth , that there be dogs of such and huge stature , and so fierce , that they are able in fight to match bulls , and to master lions . Which is true , as I understand by diverse , who told me , that there towards the North Ocean they make their dogs to draw in carts like oxen , by reason of their bigness and strength . Moreover , upon that part of Etilia where we arrived , there is a new cottage built , wherein they have placed Tartars and Russians both together , to ferry over , and transport messengers going and coming to and from the court of Baatu . For 
 271 
 Baatu remains upon the farther side towards the East . Neither ascendeth he in Summer time more Northward then the foresaid place where we arrived , but was even then descending to the South . From Januarie until August both he and all other Tartars ascend by the banks of rivers towards cold and Northerly regions , and in August they begin to return back again . 
 He descended We passed down the stream therefore in a bark , from dim > ne the the foresaid . cottage unto his court . From the same 
 To’barke place unto villages of Bulgaria the greater , standing 
 towards the North , it is five days journey . I wonder what devil carried the religion of Mahomet thither . For , from Derbent , which is upon the extreme borders of Persia , it is above 30. days journey to pass overthwart the desert , and so to ascend by the bank of 
 Astracan . Etilia , into the foresaid country of Bulgaria . All which way there is no city , but only certain cottages near unto that place where Etilia falls into the sea . Those Bulgarians are most wicked Saracens , more earnestly professing the damnable religion of Mahomet , then 
 The descrip - any other nation whatsoever . Moreover , when I first cion of Baatu beheld the court of Baatu , I was astonished at the sighed sscomt . thereof : for his houses or tents seemed as though they had be some huge and mighty city , stretching out a great way in length , the people ranging up and down about it for the space of some three or foure leagues . And even as the people of Israel knew every man , on which side of the tabernacle to pitch his tent : even so every one of them knoweth right well , towards what side of the court he ought to place his house when he takes it from ofF the cart . Whereupon the court 
 called in their language Horda , which signifies , the et tO e mt st . mjjst . because the governor or chieftain among them dwells always in the midst of his people : except only that directly towards the South no subject or inferior person places himself , because towards that region the court gates are set open : but unto the right hand , and the left hand they extend themselves as far as they 
 272 
 will , according to the conveniency of places , so that they place not their houses directly opposite against the court . At our arrival we were conducted unto a Saracen , who provided not for us any victuals at all . The day following , we were brought unto the court : and Baatu had caused a large tent to be erected , because his house or ordinary tent could not contain so many men and women as were assembled . Our guide admonished us not to speak , till Baatu had given us commandment so to do , and that then we should speak our minds briefly . Then Baatu demanded whither your Majesty had sent Ambassadors unto him or no ? I answered , that your Majesty had sent messengers to Ken-Can : and that you would not have sent messengers unto him , or letters unto Sartach , had not your Highness be persuaded that they were become Christians : because you sent not unto them for any fear , but only for congratulation , and courtesies sake , in regard that you herd they were converted to Christianitie . Then led he us unto his pavilion : and we were charged not to touch the cords of the tent , which they account in stead of the threshold of the house . There we stood in our habit barefooted , and bareheaded , and were a great and strange spectacle in their eyes . For indeed Friar John de Plano John de Plano Carpini had been there before my coming : Carpini . howbeit , because he was the Popes messenger , he changed his habit that he might not be contemned . Then we were brought into the very midst of the tent , neither required they of us to do any reverence by bowing our knees , as they use to do of other messengers . we stood therefore before him for the space wherein a man might have rehearsed the Psalm , Miserere mei Deus : and there was great silence kept of all men . Baatu himself sat upon a seat long and broad like unto a bed , guilt all over , with three stairs to ascend thereunto , and one of his ladies sat beside him . The men there assembled , sat down scattering , some on the right hand of the said Lady , and some on the left . Those places 
 i 273 s 
 on the one side which the women filled not up ( for there were only the wives of Baatu ) were supplied by the men . Also , at the very entrance of the tent , stood a bench furnished with cosmos , and with stately great cups of silver , and gold , being richly set with precious stones . Baatu beheld us earnestly , and we him : and he seemed to me to resemble in personage , Monsieur John de beau mont , whose soul rests in peace . And he had a fresh ruddy colour in his countenance . At length he commanded us to speak . Then our guide gave us direction , that we should bow our knees & speak . Whereupon 1 bowed one knee as unto a man : then he signified that I should kneel upon both knees : and 1 did so , being loath to contend about such circumstances . And again he commanded me to speak . Then I thinking of prayer unto God , because I kneeled on both my knees , began to pray on this wise : Sir , we beseech the Lord , from whom all good things do proceed , and who hath given you these earthly benefits , that it would please him hereafter to make you partaker of his heavenly blessings : because the former without these are but vain and improfitable . And I added further . Be it known unto you of a certainty , that you shall not obtain the joys of heaven , unless you become a Christian : for God says , Whosoever believeth & is baptised , shall saved : but he that believeth not , shall condemned . At this word he modestly smiled : but the other Moals began to clap their hands , and to deride us . And my silly interpreter , of whom especially I should have received comfort in time of need , was himself abashed & utterly dashed out of countenance . Then , after silence made , I said unto him , I came unto your son , because we herd that he was become a Christian : and I brought unto him letters on the behalf of my sovereign Lord the king of France : and your son sent me hither unto you . The cause of my coming therefore is best known unto your self . Then he caused me to rise up . And he inquired your majesties name , and my name , and the name of mine 
 274 
 associate and interpreter , and caused them all to be put down in writing . He demanded likewise ( because he had be informed , that you were departed out of your own countries' with and army ) against whom you waged war ? I answered : against the Saracens , who had defiled the house of God at Jerusalem . He asked also , whither your Highness had ever before that time sent any messengers unto him , or no ? To you sir ? ( said I ) never . Then caused he us to fit down , and gave us of his milk to drink , which they account to be a great favour , especially when any man is admitted to drink Cosmos with him in his own house . And as I sat looking down upon the ground , he commanded me to lift up my countenance , being desirous as yet to take more diligent view of us , or else perhaps for a kind of superstitious observation . For they esteem it a sign of ill luck , or a prognostication of evil unto them , when any man sits in their presence , holding down his head , as if he were sad : especially when he leans his cheek or chin upon his hand . Then we departed forth , and immediately after came our guide unto us , and conducting us unto our lodging , said unto me : Your master the King requesteth that you may remain in this land , which request Baatu cannot satisfy without the knowledge and consent of Mangu-Can . Wherefore you , and your interpreter must of necessity go unto Mangu-Can . Howbeit your associate , and the other man shall return unto the court of Sartach , staying there for you , till you come back . Then began the man of God mine interpreter to lament , esteeming himself but a dead man . Mine associate also protested , that they should sooner chop off his head , then withdraw him out of my company . Moreover I my self said , that without mine associate I could not go : and that we stood in need of two servants at the least , to attend upon us , because , if one should chance to fallen sick , we could not be without another . Then returning unto the court , he told these sayings unto Baatu . And Baatu commanded saying : let 
 275 
 the two Priests and the interpreter go together , but let the clerk return unto Sartach . And coming again unto us , he told us even so . And when I would have spoken for the clerk to have had him with us , he said : No more words : for Baatu hath resolved , that so it shall be , and therefore I dare not go unto the court any more . Goset the clerk had remaining of the alms money bestowed upon him , 26. Yperperas , and no more ; 10. whereof he kept for himself and for the lad , and 16. he gave unto the man of God for us . And thus were we parted asunder with tears : he returning unto the court of Sartach , and our selves remaining still in the same place . 
 Of our journey towards the Court of Mangu Can . Chap. 22. 
 UPon Assumption even our clerk arrived at the court of Sartach . And on the morrow after , the Nestorian Priests were adorned with our vestments in the presence of the said Sartach . Then we our selves were conducted unto another host , who was appointed to provide us housefoome , victuals , and horses . But because we had not ought to bestow upon him , he did They travel all things untowardly for us . Then we road on for-^thubanh^of^ ward whh Baatu , descending along by the bank of Etilia , Etilia . J for the space of five weeks together : Sometime mine associate was so extremely hungry , that he would tell me in a manner weeping , that it fared with him as though he had never eaten any thing in all his life before . There is a fair or market following the court of Baatu at all times : but it was so far distant from us that we could not have recourse thereunto . For we were constrained to walk on foot for want of horses . At length Hungarians , certain Hungarians ( who had sometime be after a sort 
 Clergy men ) found us out : and one of them could as yet sing many songs without book , and was accounted of other Hungarians as a Priest , and was sent for unto the funerals of his deceased country men . There was 276 
 another of them also prettily well instructed in his Grammar : for he could understand the meaning of any thing that we spoke , but could not answer us . These Hungarians were a great comfort unto us , bringing us Cosmos to drink , yea , and sometime flesh for to eat also : who , when they requested to have some books of us , and I had not any to give them ( for indeed we had none but only a Bible , and a breviary ) it grieved me exceedingly . And I said unto them : Bring me some ink and paper , and I will write for you so long as we shall remain here : and they did so . And I copied out for them Horas beatae Virginis , and Officium defunctorum . Moreover , upon a certain day , there was a Comanian A Comanian . that accompanied us , saluting us in Latin , and saying : Salvete Domini . Wondering thereat and saluting him again , I demanded of him , who had taught him that kind of salutation ? He said that he was baptised in Hungaria by our Friars , and that of them he learned it . 
 He said moreover , that Baatu had inquired many things of him concerning us , and that he told him the estate of our order . Afterward I saw Baatu riding with Kiss company , and all his subject's that were householders or master's of families riding with him , and ( in mine estimation ) they were not five hundred persons in all . At length about the end of Holy rood , there came a certain rich Moal unto us ( whose father was a Millenary , which is a great office among them ) saying : I am the man that must conduct you unto Mangu-Can , and we have thither a journey of foure months long to travel , and A journey of there is such extreme cold in those parts , that stones and +• months trees do even rive asunder in regard thereof . Therefore rome I would wish you thoroughly to advice your selves , whither you be able to endure it or no . Unto whom I answered : I hope by Gods help that we shall able to brook that which other men can endure . Then he said : if you cannot endure it , I will forsake you by the way . And I answered him : it were not just dealing for you so to do : for we go not thither upon any business of our own , 
 277 
 but by reason that we are sent by your lord . Wherefore since we are committed unto your charge , you ought in no wise to forsake us . Then he said : all shall well . Afterwards he caused us to show him all our garments : and whatsoever he deemed to be less needful for us , he willed us to leave it behind in the custody of our host . On the morrow they brought unto each of us a furred gown , made all of rams skins , with the wool still upon them , and breeches of the same , and boots also or buskin's according to their fashion , and shoes made of felt , and hoods also made of skins after their manner . 
 The 16. of The second day after Holy rood , we began to set forward September . on our journey , having three guides to direct us : and we 46. days . road continually Eastward , till the feast of All Saints . 
 Throughout all that region , and beyond also did the Or , Kangjtt& . people of Changle inhabit , who were by parentage descended from the Romans . Upon the North side of us , we had Bulgaria the greater , and on the South , the foresaid Caspian sea . 
 Or , laic . Of the river of lagac : and of diverse regions or nations . Chap. 23. 
 laic twelve TO TO Aving traveled twelve days journey from Etilia , we days journey x found a mighty river called lagac : which river jtom oga . issuing out of the North , from the land of Pascatir , 
 descendeth into the foresaid sea . The language of Pascatir . Pascatir , and of the Hungarians is all one , and they are all of them shepherds , not having any cities . And their country bordereth upon Bulgaria the greater , on the West frontier thereof . From the Northeast part of the said country , there is no city at all . For Bulgaria the greater is the farthest country that way , that hath any city therein . Out of the forenamed region of Pascatir , descendedfrom Proceeded the Hunnes of old time , who afterward were the Bascirdes . caded Hungarians . Next unto it is Bulgaria the greater . 
 Isidore reporteth concerning the people of this nation , that with swift horses they traversed the impregnable walls and bounds of Alexander , ( which , together with the rocks 278 
 of Caucasus , served to restrain those barbarous and bloodthirsty people from invading the regions of the South ) insomuch that they had tribute paid unto them , as far as TEgypt . Likewise they wasted all countries even unto France . Whereupon they were more mighty then the Tartars as yet are . And unto them the Blacians , the ValaMans . Bulgarians , and the Vandals joined themselves . For out of Bulgaria the greater , came those Bulgarians . Moreover , they which inhabit beyond Danubius , near unto Constantinople , and not far from Pascatir , are called Ilac , which ( saving the pronunciation ) is all one with Blac , ( for the Tartars cannot pronounce the letter B ) from whom also descended the people which inhabit the land of Assani . For they are both of them called Ilac ( both these , & the other ) in you languages of the Russians , the Polonians , & the Bohemians . The Sclavonians speak all one language with the Vandals , all which banded themselves with the Hunnes : and now for the most part , they unite themselves unto the Tartars : whom God hath raised up from the utmost parts of the earth , according 
 to that which the Lord says : I will provoke them to 32 - v-envy ( namely such as keep not his Law ) by a people , which is no people , and by a foolish nation will I anger ' ' ' them . This prophecy is fulfilled , according to the literal sense thereof , upon all nations which observe not the Law of God . All this which I have written concerning the land of Pascatir , was told me by certain Friars predicants , which travailed thither before ever the Tartars came abroad . And from that time they were subdued unto their neighbours the Bulgarians being Saracens , whereupon many of them proved Saracens also . Other matters concerning this people , may be known out of Chronicles . 
 For it is manifest , that those provinces beyond Constantinople , which are now called Bulgaria , Valachia , & Sclavonia , were of old time provinces belonging to the Greeks . Also Hungaria was heretofore called Pannonia . And we were riding over the land of Cangle , from the feast of Holy rood , until the feast of All Saints : travail - country . 
 279 
 ing almost every day ( according to mine estimation ) as far , as from Paris to Orleans , and sometime farther , as we were provided of post horses : for some days we had change of horses twice or thrice in a day . Sometime we travailed two or three days together , not finding any people , and then we were constrained not to ride so fast . Of 20. or 30. horses we had always the worst , because we were strangers . For every one took their choice of the best horses before us . They provided me always of a strong horse , because I was very corpulent & heavy : but whither he ambled a gentle pace or no , I durst not make any question . Neither yet durst I complain , although he trotted full soar . But every man must be contented with his lot as it fell . Whereupon we were exceedingly troubled : for oftentimes our horses were tired before we could come at any people . And then we were constrained to beat and whip on our horses , and to lay our garments upon other empty horses : yea and sometime two of us to ride upon one horse . 
 Of the hunger , and thirst , and other misery's , which we sustained in our journey . 
 Chap. 24. 
 OF hunger and thirst , cold and weariness , there was no end . For they gave us no victuals , but only in the evening . In the morning they used to give us a little drink , or some sodden Millet to sup off . In the evening they bestowed flesh upon us , as namely , a shoulder and breast of rams mutton , and every man a measured quantity of broth to drink . When we had sufficient of the flesh-broth , we were marvellously well refreshed . And it seemed to me most pleasant , and most nourishing drink . Every Saterday I remained fasting until night , without eating or drinking of ought . And when night came , I was constrained , to my great grief and sorrow , to eat flesh . Sometime we were feign to eat flesh half sodden , or almost raw , and all for want of fuel to seethe it withal : especially when we lay in the fields , or were 280 
 1253-benighted before we came at our journeis end : because we could not then conveniently gather together the dung of horses or oxen : for other fuel we found but seidome , except perhaps a few thorns in some places . Likewise Certain upon the banks of some rivers , there are woods growing nvers " here and there . Howbeit they are very rare . In the beginning our guide highly disdained us , and it was tedious unto him to conduct such base fellows . After - 
 ward , when he began to know us somewhat better , he directed us on our way by the courts of rich Moals , and we were requested to pray for them . Wherefore , had 1 carried a good interpreter with me , I should have had opportunity to have done much good . The foresaid Chingis , who was the first great Can or Emperor of the Tartars , had foure sons , of whom proceeded by natural descent many children , every one of which doth at this day enjoy great possessions : and they are daily multiplied and dispersed over that huge and waste desert , which is , in dimensions , like unto the Ocean Sea. Our guide therefore directed us , as we were going on our journey , unto many of their habitations . And they marveiled exceedingly , that we would receive neither gold , nor silver , nor precious and costly garments at their hands . They inquired also , concerning the great Pope , whither he was of so lasting and age as they had herd ? For there had gone a report among them , that he was 500. years old . They inquired likewise of our countries , whither there were abundance of sheep , oxen , & horses or no ? Concerning the Ocean sea , they could not conceive of it , because it was without limits or banks . Upon the even of you feast of All Saints , we forsook the way leading towards the East , ( because the people were now descended 
 very much South ) and we went on our journey by certain Alpes , or mountains directly Southward , for the space of Eight Jays 8. days together . In the foresaid desert I saw many j°urney asses ( which they call Colan ) being rather like unto mules : wJrd ' ■ f these did our guide & his companions chase very eagerly : f00te _ J howbeit , they did but loose their labour : for the beasts

 were two swift for them . Upon the 7. day there appeared to the South of us huge high mountains , and we entered into a place which was well watered , and fresh as a garden , and found land tilled and manured . The eight day after the feast of All Saints , we arrived at a certain town of the Saracens , nam Kenchat , the governor whereof met our guide at the towns end with ale and cups . For it is their manner at all towns and villages , subject unto them , to meet the messengers of Baatu and Mangu-Can with meat and drink . At the same time of the year , they went upon the ice in that country . And before the The 7. day of feast of S. Michael , we had frost in the desert . I November . inquired the name of that province : but being now in a strange territory , they could not tell me the name thereof , but only the name of a very small city in A gnat river , the same province . And there descended a great river down from the mountains , which watered the whole region , according as the inhabitants would give it passage , by making diverse channels and sluices : neither did this river exonerate it self into any sea , but was swallowed up by and hideous gulf into the bowels of the earth : Many lake's , and it caused many fens or lake's . Also I saw many Vines . vines , and drank of the wine thereof .

 How Ban was put to death : and concerning the habitation of the Dutch men . Chap. 25. 
 THe day following , we came unto another cottage near unto the mountains . And I inquired what mountains they were , which I understood to be the mountains of Caucasus , which are stretched forth , & continued on both parts to the sea , from the West unto the East : and on the West part they are conjoined unto the foresaid Caspian sea , whereinto the river of Volga dischargeth his streams . I inquired also of the city of Talas , wherein were certain Dutchmen servants unto one Buri , of whom Friar Andrew made mention . Concerning whom also I inquired very diligently in the courts of Sartach 8c Baatu . Howbeit I could have no intelligence 282 
 of them , but only that their lord & master Ban was put to death upon the occasion following : This Ban was not placed in good and fertile pastures . And upon a certain day being drunken , he spoke on this wise unto his men . Am not I of the stock and kindred of Chingis Can , as well as Baatu ? ( for in very deed he was brother or nephew unto Baatu . ) Why then do I not pass and repass upon the bank of Etilia , to feed my cattle there , as freely as Baatu himself doth ? Which speeches of his were reported unto Baatu . Whereupon Baatu wrote unto his servants to bring their Lord bound unto him . And they did so . Then Baatu demanded of him whither he had spoken any such words ? And he confessed that he had . Howbeit , ( because it is the Tartars manner to pardon drunken men ) he excused himself that he was drunken at the same time . Howe durst thou ( quoth Baatu ) once name me in thy drunkenness ? And with that he caused his head to be chopped off . Concerning the foresaid Dutchmen , I could not understand ought , till I was come unto the court of Mangu-Can . And there I was informed that Mangu-Can had removed them out of the jurisdiction of Baatu , for the space of a months journey from Talas Eastward , unto a certain village , called Bolac : where they are set to dig gold , and to make armour . Whereupon I could neither go nor come by them . I passed very near the said city in going forth , as namely , within three days journey thereof : but I was ignorant that I did so : neither could I have turned out of my way , albeit I had known so much . From the foresaid cottage we went directly Eastward , by the mountains aforesaid . And from that time we travailed among the people of Mangu-Can , who in all places sang and danced before our guide , because he was the messenger of Baatu . For this courtesy they do afford eke to other : namely , the people of Mangu-Can receiving the messengers of Baatu in manner aforesaid : and so likewise the people of Baatu entertaining the messengers of Mangu-Can . Notwithstanding the people 283

 of Baatu are more surly and stout , and show not so much courtesy unto the subjects of Mangu-Can , as they do unto them . A few days after , we entered upon those Alpes where the Cara Catayans were wont to inhabit . And there we found a mighty river : insomuch that we were constrained to embark our selves , and to sail over it . Afterwards we came into a certain valley , where I saw a castle destroyed , the walls whereof were only of mud : and in that place the ground was tilled also . And there we found a certain village , nam Equius , wherein were Saracens , speaking the Persian language : howbeit they dwelled and huge distance from Persia . The day following , having passed over the foresaid Alpes which descended from the great mountains Southward , we entered into a most beautiful plain , having high mountains on our right hand , and on the left hand of us a certain Sea or lake , which containeth fifteene days journey in circuit . All the foresaid plain is most commodiously watered with certain freshets distilling from the said mountains , all which do fallen into the lake . In Summer time we returned by the North shore of the said lake , and there were great mountains on that side also . Upon the forenamed plain there were wont to be great store of villages : but for the most part they were all wasted , in regard of the fertile pastures , that the Tartars might feed their cattle there . we found one great city there nam Cailac , wherein was a mars , and great store of Merchant's frequenting it . In this city we remained fifteene days , staying for a certain Scribe or Secretary of Baatu , who ought to have accompanied our guide for the dispatching of certain affairs in the court of Mangu . All this country was wont to be called Organum : and the people thereof had their proper language , and their peculiar kind of writing . But it was altogether inhabited of the people called Contomanni . The Nestorians likewise in those parts used the very same kind of language and writing . They are called Organa , because they were wont to be most 
 284 
 skilful in playing upon the Organs or cithern , as it was reported unto me . Here first did I see worshippers of idols , concerning whom , be it known unto your majesty , that there be many sects of them in the East countries . 
 How the Nestorians , Saracens , and Idolaters are joined together . Chap. 26. 
 THe first sort of these idolaters are called Jugures : The people whose land bordereth upon the foresaid land of Jusures Organum , within the said mountains Eastward : and in all their cities Nestorians do inhabit together , and they are dispersed likewise towards Persia in the cities of the Saracens . The citizens of the foresaid city of Cailac had 3. idole-Temples : and I entered into two of them , to behold their foolish superstitions . In the first of which I found a man having a cross painted with ink upon his hand , whereupon I supposed him to be a Christian : for he answered like a Christian unto all questions which I demanded of him . And I asked him , Why therefore have you not the cross with the image of Jesu Christ thereupon ? And he answered : We have no such custom . Whereupon I conjectured that they were indeed Christians : but , that for lack of instruction they omitted the foresaid ceremony . For I saw there behind a certain chest ( which was unto them in steed of and altar , whereupon they set candles and oblations ) and image having wings like unto the image of Saint Michael , and other images also , holding their fingers , as if they would bless some body . That evening I could not find any thing else . For the Saracens do only invite men thither , but they will not have them speak of their religion . And therefore , when I inquired of the Saracens concerning such ceremonies , they were offended thereat . On the morrow after were the Kalends , and the Saracens feast of Passeover . And changing mine Inn or lodging the same day , I took up mine abided near unto another idole-Temple . For 
 285 
 the citizens of the said city of Cailac do courteously invite , & lovingly entertain all messengers , every man of them according to his ability and portion . And entering into the foresaid idole-Temple , I found the Priests of the said idols there . For always at the Kalends they set open their Temples , and the priests adorn themselves , and offer up the peoples oblations of bred and fruits . First therefore I will describe 
 Frier William was at Caracarum . 
 unto you those rites and ceremonies , which are common unto all their idole-Temples : and then the superstitions of the foresaid Jugures , which be , as it were , a sect distinguished from the rest . They do all of them worship towards the North , clapping their hands together , and prostrating themselves on their knees upon you earth , holding also their foreheads in their hands . Whereupon the Nestorians of those parts will in no case join their hands together in time of prayer : but they pray , displaying their hands before their breasts . They extend their Temples in length East and West : and upon the North side they built a chamber , in manner of a Vestry for themselves to go forth into . Or sometime it is otherwise . If it be a foure square Temple , in the midst of the Temple towards the North side thereof , they take in one chamber in that place where the choir should stand . And within the said chamber they place a chest long and broad like unto a table : and behind the said chest towards the South stands their principali idol : which I saw at Caracarum , and it was as big as the idol of Saint Christopher . Also a certain Nestorian priest , which had been in Catay , said that in that country there is and idol of so huge a bigness , that it may be seen two days journey before a man come at it . And so they place other idols round about the foresaid principal idol , being all of them finely gilded over with pure gold : and upon the said chest , which is in manner of a table , they set candles and oblations . The doors of their Temples are always opened towards the South , contrary to the custom of the Saracens . They have also great 
 286 
 belles like unto us . And that is the cause ( as I think ) why the Christians of the East will in no case use great bells . Notwithstanding they are common among the Russians , and Grecians of Gasaria . 
 Of their Temples and idols : and how they behave themselves in worshipping their false gods . Chap. 27. 
 A LI their Priests had their heads and beards shaved quite over : and they are clad in saffron coloured garments : and being once shaved , they led and unmarried life from that time forward : and they live and hundreth or two hundreth of them together in one cloister or covent . Upon those days when they enter into their temples , they place two long forms therein : and so sitting upon the said forms like singing men in a quire , namely the one half of them directly over against the other , they have certain books in their hands , which sometime they lay Books . down by them upon the forms : and their heads are bore so long as they remain in the temple . And there they read softly unto themselves , not uttering any voice at all . Whereupon coming in among them , at the time of their superstitious devotions , and finding them all siting mute in manner aforesaid , I attempted diverse ways to provoke them unto speech , and yet could not by any means possible . They have with them also whithersoever they go , a certain string with and hundreth or two hundreth nutshells thereupon , much like to our beadroll which we carry about with us . And they do always utter these words : Ou mam Hactani , God thou knowest : as one of them expounded it unto me . And so often do they expect a reward at Gods hands , as they pronounce these words in remembrance of God . Round about their temple they do always make a fair court , like unto a churchyard , which they environ with a good wall : and upon the South part thereof they built a great portal , wherein they fit and confer together . And upon the top of the said portali they pitch a long pole right up , 
 287 
 exalting it , if they can , above all the whole town beside . And by the same pole all men may know , that there stands the temple of their idols , These rites and ceremonies aforesaid be common unto all idolaters in those parts . Going upon a time towards the foresaid idol-temple , I found certain priests sitting in the outward portal . And those which I saw , seemed unto me , by their shaved beards , as if they had be French men . They wore certain ornaments upon their heads made of paper . The priests of the foresaid Jugures do use such attire whithersoever they go . They are always in their saffron coloured jackets , which be very straight being laced or buttened from the bosom right down , after the French fashion . And they have a cloak upon their left shoulder descending before and behind under their right arm , like unto a deacon carrying the houssel-boxe in time Paper . of lent . Their letters or kind of writing the Tartars did So doe the receive . They begin to write at the top of their paper people of China drawjng their lines right down : and so they read and “ draw'mgfheir multiply their lines from the left hand to the right . They lines perpendi - do use certain papers and characters in their magical cularly down - practises . Whereupon their temples are full of such short ward , not scrou ] es hanged round about them . Also Mangu-Can righthand sent letters unto your Majesty written in the to the lefie . language of the Moals or Tartars , and in the foresaid hand or letter of the Jugures . They burn their dead according to the ancient custom , and lay up the ashes in the top of a Pyramid . Now , after I had fit a while by the foresaid priests , and entered into their temple and seen many of their images both great and small , I demanded of them what they believed concerning God ? And they answered : We believe that there is only one God . And I demanded farther : Whither doe you believe that he is a spirit , or some bodily substance ? They said : We believe that he is a spirit . Then said I : Do you believe that God ever took men nature upon him ? They answered : Noe. And again I said : Since you believe that he is a spirit , to what end do you make so 
 288 
 many bodily images to represent him ? Since also you believe not that he was made man : why do you resemble him rather unto the image of a man then of any other creature ? Then they answered saying : we frame not those images whereby to represent God . But when any rich man among us , or his son , or his wife , or any of his friends deceaseth , he causeth the image of the dead party to be made , and to be placed here : and we in remembrance of him doe reverence thereunto . Then I replied : you do these things only for the friendship and flattery of men . Noe ( said they ) but for their memory . Then they demanded of me , as it were in scoffing wise : Where is God ? To whom I answered : where is your soul ? They said , in our bodies . Then said I , is it not in every part of your body , ruling and guiding the whole body , and yet notwithstanding is not seen or perceived ? Even so God is every where and ruleth all things , and yet is he invisible , being understanding and wisdom it self . Then being desirous to have had some more conference with them , by reason , that mine interpreter was weary , and not able to express my meaning , I was constrained to keep silence . The Moals or Tartars are in this regard of their sect : namely they believe that there is but one God : howbeit they make images of felt , in remembrance of their deceased friends , covering them with five most rich and costly garments , and putting them into one or two carts , which carts no man dare once touch : and they are in the custody of their soothsayers , who are their priests , concerning whom I will give your Highness more at large to understand hereafter . These soothsayers or diviners do always attend upon the court of Mangu and of other great personages . As for the poorer or meaner sort , they have them not , but such only as are of the stock and kindred of Chingis . And when they are to remove or to take any journey , the said diviners go before them , even as the cloudy pillar went before the children of Israel . And they appoint ground where the tents must 
 i 289 TO 
 be pitched , and first of all they take down their own houses : & after them the whole court does the like . 
 Also upon their festival days or kalends they take forth the foresaid images , and place them in order round , or circle wise within the house . Then come the Moals or Tartars , and enter into the same house , bowing themselves before the said images and worship them . Moreover , it is not lawful for any stranger to enter into that house . For upon a certain time I my self would have gone in , but I was chidden full well for my labour . 
 Of diverse and sundry nations : and of certain people which were wont to eat their own parents . Chap. 28. 
 BUt the foresaid Jugures ( who live among the Christians , and the Saracens ) by their sundry disputations , as I suppose , have be brought unto this , to believe , that there is but one only God . And they dwelled in certain cities , which afterwards were brought in subjection unto Chingis Can : whereupon he gave his daughter in marriage unto their king . Also the city of Caracarum it self is in a manner within their territory : The country and the whole country of king or Presbyter John , & of ofPresbiter bis brother Vut lies near unto their dominions : saving , that they inhabit in certain pastures Northward , and the said Jugures between the mountains towards the South . Whereupon it came to pass , that the Moals received letters from them . And they are the Tartars principali scribes : & all the Nestorians almost can skill of their letters . Next unto them , between the foresaid Tangut . mountains Eastward , inhabiteth the nation of Tangut , who are a most valiant people , and took Chingis in battle . But after the conclusion of a league he was set at liberty by them , and afterwards subdued them . These Strange oxen , people of Tangut have oxen of great strength , with tails like unto horses , and with long shag hair upon their backs and bellies . They have legs greater then other oxen have , and they are exceedingly fierce . These oxen 
 290 
 draw the great houses of the Moals : and their horns are slender , long , straight , and most sharp pointed : insomuch that their owners are feign to cut off the ends of them . A counterfeit we will not suffer her self to be coupled unto one of them , unless they whistle or sing unto her . They have also the qualities of a Buff : for if they see a man clothed in read , they run upon him immediately to kill him . Next unto them are the people of Tebet , men which were wont to eat the carcases of their deceased parents : that for pities sake , they might make no other sepulchre for them , then their own bowels . Howbeit of late they have left off this custom , because that thereby they became abominable and odious unto all other nations . Notwithstanding unto this day they make fine cups of the skulls of their parents , to the end that when they drink out of them , they may amid all their jollities and delights call their dead parents to remembrance . This was told me by one that saw it . The said people of Tebet have great plenty of gold in their land . Whosoever therefore wants gold , diggeth till he hath found some quantity , and then taking so much thereof as will serve his turn , he layeth up the residue within the earth : because , if he should put it into his chest or storehouse , he is of opinion that God would withhold from him all other gold within the earth . I saw some of those people , being very deformed creatures . In Tangut I saw lusty tall men , but brown and swart in colour . The Jugures are of a middle stature like unto our French men . among the Jugures is the originali and root of the Turkish , and Comanian languages . Next unto Tebet are the people of Langa and Solanga , whose messengers I saw in the Tartars court . And they had brought more then ten great carts with them , every one of which was drawn with sixe oxen . They be little brown men like unto Spaniards . Also they have jackets , like unto the upper vestment of a deacon , saving that the sleeves are somewhat straighter . And they have miters upon their heads like bishops . But the before part of their

 miter is not so hollow within as the hinder part : neither is it sharp pointed or cornered at the top : but there hang down certain square flappes compacted of a kind of straw which is made rough and rugged with extreme heat , and is so trimmed , that it glittereth in the sun beams , like unto a glass , or and helmet well burnished . And about their temples they have long bans of the foresaid matter fastened unto their miters , which hover in the wind , as if two long homes grew out of their heads . And when the wind tosses them up and down too much , they tie them over the midst of their miter from one temple to another : and so they lie circle wise overthwart their heads . Moreover their principal messenger Atabkofele - coming unto the Tartars court had a table of elephants phants tooth , about him of a cubit in length , and a handful in 
 breadth , being very smooth . And whensoever he spoke unto the Emperor himself , or unto any other great personage , he always beheld that table , as if he had found therein those things which he spoke : neither did he cast his eyes to the right hand , nor to the left , nor upon his face , with whom he talked . Yea , going too and from before his lord , he looks no where but only upon ne people is table . Beyond them ( as I understand of a certainty ) called Muc. there are other people called Muc , having villages , but no one particular man of them appropriating any cattle unto 
 himself . Notwithstanding there are many flocks and droves of cattle in their country , & no man appointed to keep them . But when any one of them stands in need of any beast , he ascendeth up unto and hill , and there makes a shout , and all the cattle which are within hearing of the noise , come flocking about him , and suffer themselves to be handled and taken , as if they were tame . And when any messenger or stranger comes into their country , they shut him up into and house , ministering there things necessary unto him , until his business be dispatched . For if any stranger should travel through that country , the cattle would flee away at the very sent of him , and so would become wild . Beyond Muc is great 
 292 
 Cathaya , the inhabitants whereof ( as I suppose ) were of Great old time , called Seres . For from them are brought most Cat^a-excellent stuffs of silk . And this people is called Seres of a certain town in the same country . I was credibly informed , that in the said country , there is one town having walls of silver , and bulwarks or towers of gold . There be many provinces in that land , the greater part whereof are not as yet subdued unto the Tartars . And amongst* 
 Somewhat is wanting .
