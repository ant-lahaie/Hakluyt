A commandment to the Bassa of Alexandria . 
 THe Ambassador for the Queens most excellent 
 Majesty of England by supplication certified us , how that notwithstanding our privilege granted them to make Consuls in all parts of our dominions to govern their nation according to their own custom & law , to defend them against all wrongs and injuries whatsoever : yet that the French Consuli affirming to thee that art Bassa , that they were under his banner , and that he should govern them , and oversee their business , and having god a new privilege , mentioning therein the English men to be under his banner , did by all means molest 8c trouble them , insomuch that their Consuli oppressed with many injuries fled away , and that thou which art Beglerbie didst maintain the French Consul herein ; whereupon the Ambassador required our commandment , that they might have justice for these injuries : wherefore we command thee that having received this our commandment , you examine diligently that his privilege , and send the copy thereof hither , and if it be found that the French Consuli Vento hath by subtlety god the aforesaid privilege written , that you then see him punished , and suffer not hereafter the French or Venetian Consuls to intermeddle with their business . Obey this our commandment , and give credit to the seal .
