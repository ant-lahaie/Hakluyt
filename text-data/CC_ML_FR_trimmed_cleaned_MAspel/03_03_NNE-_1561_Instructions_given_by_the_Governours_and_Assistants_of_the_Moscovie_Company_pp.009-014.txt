THE RUSSIA COMPANY’S INSTRUCTIONS a.d. 
 1561. 
 A remembrance given by us the Governors , Consuls , and Assistants of the company of Merchant's trading into Russia , the eight day of May 1561 , to our trusty friend Anthonie Jenkinson , at his departure towards Russia , and so to Persia , in this our eight journey . 
 Irst you shall understand that we have laden in our good ship , called the Swallow , one Chest , the keys whereof we do here deliver you , and also a bill , wherein are written particularly the contents in the said Chest , and what every thing did cost : and because , as 
 you know , the said Chest is of charge , we desire you to have a speciali regard unto it , and when God shall send you unto Mosco , our minds and will is , that you , with the advice of our Agents there , do appoint some such presents for the Emperor and his son , either wine , cloth of gold , scarlet , or plate , as to your good discretion shall be thought meet , and when you have delivered unto him the Queens Majesties Letters , and our said present in the name of the Company , we think it good that you make your humble suit unto his Highness in our name , to get his licence or safe conduct for you and all other our servants or Agents at all times hereafter with such wares and merchandise as you at this time , or they hereafter at all other times shall think good to pass out of his dominions towards Tartaria , Persia , or other places , and also to return unto Mosco with such wares and merchandises as you shall bring or send from any land or country that is not in his dominions , and if it be thought good by you and our Agents there to make composition with the emperor or his officers for some certain custom or tole upon such goods as we shall 
 pass that way , to the intent we might be the better favoured , we refer it to your discretion , foreseeing that you opening of this matter be not prejudicial ! unto our former privileges . 
 And for the sale of our cloth of gold , plate , pearls , sapphires , and other jewels , we put our trust and confidence in you principally to fell them for ready money , time to good debtors , or in barter for good wares , so that you make our other Agents privy how and for what price you fell any of the premises , and also deliver such sums of money , bills or wares , as you shall receive , unto our said Agents : thinking good further , that if you perceive that the plate or other jewels , or any part thereof will not be sold for profit before your departure from the Mosco , that then you cause them to be safe packed , and set order they may be sent hither again in our ships the next year , except you perceive that there may be some profit in carrying some part of them into Persia , which we would not to be of any great valve . 
 We have also laden in the said Swallow and the other two ships 80 farthels , containing 400 kersies , as by you invoice does appear , which farthels be packed , & appointed to be carried into Persia : nevertheless , if you chance to find good sales for them in the Mosco , we think it were good to fell part of them there , and to carry the less quantity with you , because we be uncertain what vent or sale you shall find in Persia or other places where you shall come . 
 If you obtain the Emperors licence to pass out of his dominions , and to return , as aforesaid , 8c that you perceive you may safely do the same , our mind is , that at such time as you think best and most convenient for that purpose , you do appoint so many , and such of our hired servants or apprentices as you think necessary & meet for our affairs , and may best be spared , to go with you in your said voyage , whereof we would one to be such as you might make privy of 
 all your doings for diverse considerations and causes that may happen : which servants and apprentices , we will and command , by this our remembrance , to be obedient unto you as unto us , not only to go with you and to doe such things as you command them in your presence , but also to go unto such countries' or places as you shall appoint them unto , either with wares or without wares , & there to remain and continue so long as you shall think good , and if they or any of them will refuse to do such things as you do appoint them , as aforesaid , or that any of them ( be he hired servant or apprentice ) do misuse himself by any manner of disobedience or disorder , and will not by gentle and fair means be reformed , we will that you send him back to the Mosco , with straight order that he may be sent from thence hither , & let us have knowledge of his evil behaviour , to the intent that if he be a hired servant we may pay him his wages according to his service , and if he be and apprentice we may use him according to his deserts . 
 We will also that you take with you such karsies , scarlet , and other clothes , or any other such wares of ours , as you shall think good , and so in the name of God to take your journey towards Persia , either by the way of Astracan and Mare Caspium , or otherwise , as you shall see cause : and when God sends you into Persia , our mind is , that you repair unto the great Sophy with the Queens Majesties letters , if he be not too far from the Caspian sea for you to travel , and that you make him such a present as you shall think meet , and if you pass by any other kings , princes , or governors , before or after you come to the presence of the Sophy , likewise to make them some present , as you see cause , according to their estate and dignity , and withal to procure letters of privilege or safeconduct of the said Sophy or other princes in as large and ample manner as you can , for the sure establishing of further trade in merchandise by us hereafter to be 
 made , frequented and continued in those parts , not only that we may freely fell in all places within his dominions such wares as we carry thither , but also buy and bring away any manner of wares or merchandise whatsoever it be , that is for our purpose and commodity within his dominions , with free passage also for us at all times , to pass as often as we will with our goods and merchandise into any part of India or other countries' thereunto adjoining , and in like manner to return thorough his dominions into Russia or elsewhere . 
 And for the sale of our kersies or other wares that you shall have with you , as our trust is that you will do for our most profit and commodity : even so we refer all unto your good discretion , aswell in the sale of our said goods , as to make our return in such things as you shall find there , and think best for our profit . But if passage cannot be had into Persia by Astracan , or otherwise , the next Summer , which shall in the year 1562 , then our mind is , that you procure to fell our kersies , & other such wares as are appointed for Persia , in the Mosco , or other the Emperors dominions , if you may fell them for any reasonable price , and then to employ your self with such other of your servants , as you shall think The passage of meet for the search of the passage by Nova Zembla , or NovaZembla . e ] s yOU to return for England as you think good . Provided always , that if you do perceive or understand , that passage is like to be had into Persia the Summer following , which shall in the year 1563 , and that you can not fell our kersies in the Emperors dominions , as aforesaid , at a reasonable price : then we will rather they may be kept till the said Summer in the year 1563 » and then you to proceed forward upon your journey towards Persia as aforesaid . If passage into Persia cannot be obtained the next year , neither good hope of passage in the year 1563 , neither yet in the mean time good sale of our kersies in the Emperors dominions , then we think good for you to 
 see if you can practise to carry your said wares by safe conduct thorough Polonia , or any other ways unto Constantinople , or else where you think beter sale may be had , then in Russia . 
 Thus have we given you to understand our meanings in this intended adventure : but forasmuch as we do consider and know , that if we should prescribe unto you any certain way , or direct order what you should do , we might so work clean contrary to our purpose and intent : therefore knowing your approved wisdom with your experience , and also your careful and diligent mind in the achieving and bringing to good success ( by the help of almighty God ) all things that you take in hand , we do commit our whole affairs concerning the said adventure wholly unto your good discretion , praying God so to prosper you , as may be first for his glory , secondly for the honour and commodity of this realm , and next for our profit , with the increase of your good name for ever . 
 And yet further desiring , and also most earnestly requiring you , as you tender the state of our company , that you will have a speciali regard unto the order of our houses & our servants , aswell at Colmogro and Vologda , as at Mosco , and to see and consider if any misorder be among our servants or apprentices , whereby you think we might hereafter be put to hindrance or loss of any part of our goods or privilege there , that you do not only see the same reformed , but also to certify us thereof by your letter at large , as our trust is in you . 
 And for the better knowledge to be had in the princes and goodness of such things as we do partly suppose you shall find in the parts of Russia , we do herewith deliver you a quantity of certain drug , whereby you may perceive how to know the best , and also there are noted the princes of such wares and drug as be here most vendible : also we deliver you herewith one pound and one ounce weight in

 brass , to the end , that you may thereby , & with the bill of princes of wares , know what things be worth here . As for the knowledge of silks , we need not to give you any instructions thereof , other then you know . 
 And if you understand that any commodity in Russia be profitable for us to have with you into Persia or other places , our mind is that our Agents shall either provide it for you , or deliver you money to make provision your self . And because the Russes say that in traveling Eastwardes from Colmogro thirty or forty days journey , there is the main sea to be found , we think that Richard Johnson might employ his time that way by land , and to be at Mosco time enough to go with you into Persia : for if it be true that he may travel to the sea that way , and that he may know how many miles it is towards the East from Colmogro , it will be a great help for us to find out the straight and passage that way , if any be there to be had .
