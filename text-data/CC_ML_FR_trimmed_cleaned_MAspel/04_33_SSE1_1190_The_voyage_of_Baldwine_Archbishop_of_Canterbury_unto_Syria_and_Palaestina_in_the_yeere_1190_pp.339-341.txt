The life and travails of Baldwinus Devonius , sometime Archbishop of Canterbury . 
 Aldwinus Devonius , tenui loco Excestriae natus , vir over facundus , exactus Philosophus , & ad omne studiorum genus per illos dies aptissimus inveniebatur . Scholarum rector primiim erat , tum postea Archidiaconus , erudition ac sapientia in omni negotio celebris : fuit praeterea . Cister - 
 ciensis Monachus , & Abbas Fordensis Coenobii , magnus suorum estimation , ac universae eorum societati quasi Antesignanus : fuit deinde Wigorniensis praesul , fuit & mortuo demiim Richardo Cantuariorum Archiepiscopus , ac totius Angliae Primas . Cui muneri Baldwinus solliciti invigilans , egregium se pastorem exhibuit , dominicum semen , quantum patiebatur ejus temporis iniquitas , ubique locorum spargens . Richardus Anglorum rex , acceptis tunc regni insigniis , summo study classem , ac omnia ad Hierosolymitanum bellum gerendum necessaria paravit . Secutus est illico regem in Syriam , & Palaestinam usque Baldwinus , ut esset in tam Sancto ( ut ipse putabat ) itinere laborum , dolorum , ac periculorum particeps . Praefuit Cantuariensi Ecclesiae fere 6. annis , & Richardum regem in Syriam secutus , anno Salutis nostrae 1190. Tyri vitam finivit , ubi & sepultus est .

 & wisdom in all his doings . He was also a Cistercian Monk and Abbot of Foord Monastery , and the chief of all those that were of his order : he grew after this to be bishop of Worcester , and at last after the death of Archb. Richard he was promoted & made Archbishop of Canterbury , and Primate of all England . In the discharge of which place he being very vigilant , showed himself a worthy Pastor , sowing the seed of Gods word in every place as far forth as the iniquity of that time permitted . In his time king Richard with all endeavour prepared a Fleet and all things necessary for waging of war against the Infidels at Jerusalem , taking with him the standard and ensigns of the kingdom . This Baldwine eftsoons followed the king into Syria and Palestina , as one desirous to be partaker of his travails , pains , and perils in so holy a voyage . He was Archbishop of Canterburie almost sixe years : but having followed the king into 
 where he was also buried .

 INter primos Thomae Becketi successor hic secundus , audita salvatoris & salutiferae Crucis injuria nostris ( proh dolour ) diebus per Saladinum irrogata , cruce signatus , in ejusdem obsequiis , tam remotis finibus quam propinquis , praedicationis officium viriliter assumpsit . Et postmodiim iter accipiens , navigi6que fungens apud Marsiliam , transcurso tandem pelagi profundo , in portu Tyrensi incolumis applicuit : & inde ad exercitum nostrum obsidentem pariter & obsessum Aconem transivit : ubi multos ex nostris inveniens , & fere cunctos principum defectu , in summa desolation jam positos , & desperation , alios quidem longam expectation fatigatos , alios fame & inopiam graviter afflictos , quosdam vero agris

 THis Baldwine being the second successor unto Thomas Becket , after he had herd you wrong which was done to our Saviour , and the sign of the Cross by Saladine the Sultan of Egypt , taking upon him the Lords Character , he courageously performed his office of preaching in the obedience thereof , as well in far distant Countries as at home . And afterwards taking his journey and embarking himself at Marseils , having at length passed you Levant sea , he arrived safely in the Haven of Tyrus , and from thence went over to Achon unto our army , besieging the Town , and yet ( as it were ) besieged it self : where finding many of our Countrymen , and almost all men remaining in wonderful pensiveness and despair , through the withdrawing of the Princes , some of them tired with long expectation , others grievously afflicted with hunger and poverty , and others distempered with the heat of the weather , being ready happily to end his days in the Holy land , embracing every one according to his ability in the bound of love , he aided them at his costs and charges , and them with his words and good exam 
 strengthened of life .
