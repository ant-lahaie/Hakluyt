 OCther said that the country wherein he dwelled , was called Halgoland : and affirmed that there was no man dwelling towards the North from him . From this country towards the South , there is a certain II port called Scirings hall , whither , he say , that a man was not able to sail in a months space , if he lay still by night , although he had every day a full wind . And he shall sail all the way along the coast , having on his steereboord , first Jutland and the Islands which lie betwixt this country & Jutland , still along the coast of this country , till he came to Scirings hall , having it on his larboard . At Scirings hall there entereth into the land a main gulf of the Sea , which is so broad , that a man cannot see over it : and on the other side against the same , is Gotland , and then Silland . This sea stretcheth many hundreth miles up into the land . From Scirings hall he said that he sailed in 5. days to the port which is called Hetha , which lies betwixt the countries of II Wendels , Saxons , and Angles , whereunto it is subject .
