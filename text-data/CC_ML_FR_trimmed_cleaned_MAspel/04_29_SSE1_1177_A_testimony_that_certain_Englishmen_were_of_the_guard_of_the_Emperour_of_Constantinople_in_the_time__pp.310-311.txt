English men were the guard of the Emperors of Constantinople in the reign of John the son of Alexius Comnenus . Malmes-buriensis , Curopolata and Camden , page . 96. 
 Am inde Anglia non minus belli gloria , quam humanitatis cultu inter Florentissimas orbis Christiani gentes inprimis floruit . Adeo ut ad 
 custodiam corporis Constantinopolitanorum Imperatorum evocati fuerint Angli . Joannes enim Alexii Comneni filius , ut refert noster Malmesburiensis , eorum fidem suspiciens praecipue familiaritati suae applicabat , amorem eorum filio transcribens : Adeo ut jam inde longo tempore fuerint imperatorum illorum satellites , Inglini Bipenniferi Nicetae Choniatae , Barangi Curopolatae dicti . Qui ubique Imperatorem prosequebantur ferentes humeris secures , 310 
 quas tollebant , cum Imperator ex oratorio spectandum se exhibebat , Anglice vitam diuturnam secures suas collidentes ut sonitum ederent , comprecabantur . 
 The same in English . 
 FRom this time forward the kingdom of England was reputed among the most flourishing estates of Christendome , no less in chivalry then humanity . So farforth that the English men were sent for to be the guarders of the persons of the Emperors of Constantinople . For John the son of Alexius Comnenus , as our countryman William of Malmesburie reporteth , highly esteeming their fidelity , used them very never about him , recommending them over to his son : so that long time afterwards the guard of those Emperors were English halberdiers , called by Nicetas Choniata , Inglini Bipenniferi , and by Curopolata , Barangi , which always accompanied the Emperor with their halberds on their shoulders , which they held up when the Emperor coming from his Oratory showed himself to the people ; and clashing their halberds together to make a terrible found , they in the English tongue wished unto him long life .
