The report of John Huighen van Linschoten concerning M. Newberries and M. Fitches imprisonment , and of their escape , which happened while he was in Goa . 
 N the month of December , Anno 1583 , there arrived in the town and Island of Ormus foure English men , which came from Aleppo in the country of Syria , having sailed out of England , & passed thorough the straights of Gibraltar to Tripoli a town and haven lying on the 
 coast of Syria , where all the ships discharge their wares & merchandises , & from thence are carried by land unto 505 
 Aleppo , which is nine days journey . In Aleppo there are resident diverse merchants & factors of all nations , as Italians , French men , English men , Armenians , Turks and Moors , every man having his religion apart , paying tribute unto the great Turke . In that town there is great traffic , for that from thence every year twice , there travel two Caffyls , that is , companies of people and camels , which travel unto India , Persia , Arabia , and all the countries' bordering on the same , and deal in all [ II i . 266. ] sorts of merchandise , both to and from those countries' , as I in another place have already declared . Three of the said English men aforesaid , were sent by the company of English men that are resident in Aleppo , to see if in Ormus they might keep any factors , and so traffic in that place , like as also the Italians do , that is to say , the Venetians which in Ormus , Goa , and Malacca have their factors , and traffic there , aswell for stones and pearls , as for other wares and spices of those countries , which from thence are carried over land JohnNewbery into Venice . One of these English men had be once rmusbefor bef°re in the said town of Ormus , and there had taken Anno 1581 good information of the trade , and upon his advice and advertisement , the other were as then come thither with him , bringing great store of merchandises with them , as Clothes , Saffron , all kinds of drinking glasses , and Haberdashers wares , as looking glasses , knives , and such like stuff : and to conclude , brought with them all kind of small wares that may be devised . And although those wares amounted unto great sums of money , notwithstanding it was but only a shadow or colour , thereby to give no occasion to be mistrusted , or seen into : for that their principali intent was to buy great quantities of precious stones , as Diamonds , Pearls , Rubies , etc. to the which end they brought with them a great sum of money and gold , and that very secretly , not to be deceived or robbed thereof , or to run into any danger for the same . They being thus arrived in Ormus , hired a shop , and began to fell 506 
 their wares : which the Italians perceiving , whose factors continue there ( as I said before ) and fearing that those English men finding good vent for their commodities in that place , would be resident therein , and so daily increase , which would be no small loss and hindrance unto them , did presently invent all the subtle means they could to hinder them : and to that end they went unto the Captain of Ormus , as then called DONE Gonsalo de Meneses , telling him that there were certain English men come into Ormus , that were sent only to spy the country ; and said further , that they were heretics : and therefore they said it was convenient they should not be suffered so to depart , without being examined , and punished as enemies , to the example of others . The Captain being a friend unto the English men , by reason that one of them which had be there before , had given him certain presents , would not be persuaded to trouble them , but shipped them with all their wares in a ship that was to sail for Goa , and sent them to the Viceroy , that he might examine and try them , as he thought good : where when they were arrived , they were cast into prison , and first examined whither they were good Christians or no : and because they could speak but bad Portugall , only two of them spoke good Dutch , as having be certain years in the Low countries , and there trafficked , there was a Dutch Jesuite born in the town of Bruges in Flanders , that had be resident in the Indies for the space of thirty years , sent unto them , to undermine and examine them : wherein they behaved themselves so well , that they were held and esteemed for good and Catholic Christians : yet still suspected , because they were strangers , and specially English men . The Jesuites still told them that they should be sent prisoners into Portugall , wishing them to leave off their trade of maj-chandise , and to become Jesuites , promising them thereby to defend them from all trouble . The cause why they said so , and persuaded them in that earnest manner , was , for that the Dutch Jesuite had secretly 
 5°7 
 be advertised of great sums of money which they had about them , and sought to get the same into their fingers , for that the first vow and promise they make at their entrance into their Order , is , to procure the welfare of their said Order , by what means soever it be . But although the English men denied them , and refused the Order , saying , that they were unfit for such places , nevertheless they proceeded so far , that one of them , being a Painter ( that came with the other three for company , to see the countries' , and to seek his fortune , and was not sent thither by the English merchants ) partly for fear , and partly for want of means to relieve himself , promised them to become a Jesuite : and although they knew and well perceived he was not any of those that had the treasure , yet because he was a Painter , whereof there are but few in India , and that they had great need of him to paint their Church , which otherwise would cost them great charges , to bring one from Portugal , they were very glad thereof , hoping in time to get the rest of them with all their money into their fellowship : so that to conclude , they made this Painter a Jesuite , . where he continued certain days , giving him good store of work to do , and entertaining him with all the favour and friendship they could devise , and all to win the rest , to be a prey for them : but the other three continued still in prison , being in great fear , because they understood no man that came to them , nor any man almost knew what they said : till in the end it was told them that certain Dutch men dwelled in the Archbishop's house , and counsel given them to send unto them , whereat they much rejoiced , and sent to me and and other Dutch man , desiring us once to come and speak with them , which we presently did , and they with tears in their eyes made complaint unto us of their hard usage , showing us from point to point ( as it is said before ) why [ II i . 267. ] they were come into the country , withal desiring us for Gods cause , if we might by any means , to help them , that they might be set at liberty upon sureties , 508 
 being ready to endure what justice should ordain for them , saying , that if it were found contrary , and that they were other then traveling merchants , and sought to find out further benefit by their wares , they would be content to be punished . With that we departed from them , promising them to do our best : and in the end we obtained so much of the Archbishop , that he went unto the Viceroy to deliver our petition , and persuaded him so well , that he was content to set them at liberty , and that their goods should be delivered unto them again , upon condition they should put in sureties for two thousand pardawes , not to depart the country before other order should be taken with them . Thereupon they presently found a Citizen of the town that was their surety for two thousand pardawes , to whom they paid in hand one thousand and three hundred pardawes , and because they said they had no more ready money , he gave them credit , seeing what store of merchandise they had , whereby at all times life need were , he might be satisfied : and by that means they were delivered out of prison , and hired themselves and house , and began to set open shop : so that they uttered much ware , and were presently well known among all the merchants , because they always respected gentlemen , specially such as bought their wares , showing great courtesy and honour unto them , whereby they won much credit , and were beloved of all men , so that every man favoured them , and was willing to do them pleasure . To us they showed great friendship , for whose sake the Archbishop favoured them much , and showed them very good countenance , which they knew well how to increase , by offering him many presents , although he would not receive them , neither would ever take gift or present at any men hands . Likewise they behaved themselves so discreetly that no man carried and evil eye , no , nor and evil thought towards them . Which liked not the Jesuites , because it hindered them from that they hoped for , so that they ceased not still by this Dutch Jesuite to put them in fear , that 
 5°9 
 they should be sent into Portugall to the King , counseling them to yield themselves Jesuites into their Cloister , which if they did , he said they would defend them from all troubles , saying further , that he counseled them therein as a friend , & one that knew for certain that it was so determined by the Viceroys Privy council : which to effect he said they stayed but for shipping that should sail for Portugall , with diverse other persuasions , to put them in some fear , and so to effect their purpose . The English men to the contrary , durst not say any thing to them , but answered , that as yet they would stay a while , and consider thereof , thereby putting the Jesuites in comfort , as one among them , being the principali of them ( called John Newbery ) complained unto me often times , saying that he knew not what to say or think therein , or which way he might be rid of those troubles : but in the end they determined with themselves to depart from thence , and secretly by means of other friends they employed their money in precious stones ; which the better to effect , one of them was a Jeweller , and for the same purpose came with them . Which being concluded among them , they durst not make known to any man , neither did they credit us so much , as to show us their minds therein , although they told us all whatsoever they knew . But on a Whitsunday they went abroad to sport themselves about three miles from Goa , in the mouth of the river in a country called Bards , having with them good store of meat and drink . And because they should not be suspected , they left their house and shop , with some wares therein unsold , in custody of a Dutch boy , by us provided for them , that looked unto it . This boy was in the house not knowing their intent , and being in Bards , they had with them a Patamar , which is one of the Indian posts , which in the Winter times carrieth letters from one place to the other , whom they had hired to guide them : and because that between Bards and the firm land there is but a little river , in a manner half dry , they passed over it on foot , and so traveled by land ,

 ... i584‘ being never herd of again : but it is thought they arrived in Aleppo , as some say , but they know not certainly . Their greatest hope was that John Newbery could speak the Arabian tongue , which is used in all Arabian those countries' , or at the least understood ; for it is very general ! common in all places there about , as French with us . News being come to Goa , there was a great stir and murmuring among the people , and we much wondered at it : for many were of opinion , that we had given them counsel so to do : and presently their surety seized upon the goods remaining , which might amount unto above two hundred pardawes ; and with that and the money he had received of the English men , he went unto the Viceroy , and delivered it unto him : which the Viceroy having received , forgave him the rest . This flight of the English men grieved the Jesuites most , because they had lost such a pray , which they made sure account of : whereupon the Dutch Jesuite came to us to ask us if we knew thereof , saying , that if he had suspected so much , he would have dealt otherwise , for that he said , he once had in his hands of theirs a bag wherein was forty thousand veneseanders ( each veneseander being two [ II i . 268. ] pardawes ) which was when they were in prison . And that they had always put him in comfort to accomplish his desire : upon the which promise he gave them their money again , which otherwise they should not so lightly have come by , or peradventure never , as he openly said : and in the end he called them heretics , and spies , with a thousand other railing speeches , which he uttered against them . The English man that was become a Jesuite , hearing that his companions were gone , and perceiving that the Jesuites showed him not so great favour , neither used him so well as they did at the first , repented himself ; and seeing he had not as then made any solemn promise , and being counseled to leave the house , and told that he could not want a living in the town , as also that the Jesuites could not keep him there without he were willing to stay , so they could not accuse him of any thing , 
 he told them flatly that he had no desire to stay within the Cloister . And although they used all the means they could to keep him there , yet he would not stay , but hired and house without the Cloister , and opened shop , where he had good store of work : and in the end married a Mestizos daughter of the town , so that he made his account to stay there while he lived . By this English man I was instructed of all the ways , trades , and voyages of the country , between Aleppo and Ormus , and of all the ordinances and common customs which they usually hold during their voyage over the land , as also of the places and towns where they passed . And since those English men's departures from Goa , there never arrived any strangers , either English or others , by land , in the said countries' , but only Italians which daily traffic over land , and use continual trade going and coming that way .
