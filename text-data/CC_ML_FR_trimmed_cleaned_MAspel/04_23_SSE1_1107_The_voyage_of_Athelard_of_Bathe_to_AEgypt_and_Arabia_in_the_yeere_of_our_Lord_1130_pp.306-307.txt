The travails of one Athelard and Englishman , recorded by master Bale Centur. 2. 
 Bathoniensis Coenobii monachus , natuum mysteria , & causas omnes , dili-undecunque exquisiti perscrutatus est , ut cum aliquibus veteris seculi philosophis non indigni conferri possit . Hic olim spectatae indolis Adolescens , ut virente adhuc aetate juvenile ingenium fcecundaret , [ II i . 16. ] atque ad res magnas pararet , relicta dulci patria longinquas petiit regiones . Cum verb TEgyptum & Arabiam peragrans , plura invenisset , quae ejus desiderabat animus , cum magno laborum , ac literarum lucro in Angliam 306 
 Thelardus ralium rer gentis tam 
 1130. tum demum revertebatur . Claruit anno virginei partus , 1130. Henrico primo regnante . 
 The same in English . 
 AThelard a Monk of the Abbie of bath was so diligent a searcher of the secrets , and causes of natural things , that he deserveth worthily to be compared with some of the ancient Philosophers . This man although young , yet being of a good wit , and being desirous to increase and enrich the same with the best things , and to prepare himself as it were for greater matters , left his Country for a time , and travailed into foreign Regions . He went through Egypt , and Arabia , and found out many things which he desired to his own private contentment , and the profit of good letters generally , and so being satisfied , returned again into his Country : he flourished in the year 1130. Henry the first being then king of England .
