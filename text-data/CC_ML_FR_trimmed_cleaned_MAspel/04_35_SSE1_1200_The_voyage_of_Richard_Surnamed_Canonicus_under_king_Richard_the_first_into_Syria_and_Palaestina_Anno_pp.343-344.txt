The travails of one Richard surnamed 
 Canonicus . 
 Ichardus Canonicus ad Trinitatis fanum Londini Regularis , ab ipsa pueritia , bonarum artium literas impense amavit , excoluit , ac didicit . Qui ex continuo labour atque exercitatione longam , talis tandem evasit orator , & Poeta , quales ea aetas rarissimos nutriebat . Ob id Rich - 
 ardo Anglorum tunc Regi charus , longam cum eo peregrinationem in Palaestinam ac Syriam , dum expugnaret Tureas , suscepit . Unde in Angliam tum demum reversus , omnia quae presens vidit in urbibus , agris , ac militum castris , fideli narration , tam carmine quam prosa descripsit . Neque interim omisit ejusdem Regis mores , & formam , per omnia corporis lineamenta designare , addiditque praeclaro suo operi hoc aptissimum pro titulo nomen , scilicet , Itinerarium Regis Richardi . Claruit anno redemptionis nostrae 1200. sub Joanne Anglorum Rege . 
 The same in English . 
 Richard surnamed Canonicus and observant Friar of Trinitie Church in London , was in great love with the studies of good Arts , and took pains in them and learned them . And at last by his continual endeavour 
 343 
 and long exercise therein , he grew to be such and Orator and Poet , as few were in that age living , by reason whereof he grew in favour with Richard then King of England , and undertook that long voyage with him into Palestina and Syria against the Turkes . From whence being returned again into England , he faithfully described both in Verse and Prose all such things as he had seen in the Cities , fields and tents of the soldiers , where he was present , and omitted not to note the behaviour , form , and proportion of body in the foresaid king , giving to his notable work this most apt name for the title , The Journal of King Richard . He flourished in the year of our Redemption 1200. under John king of England .
