Master Davis being arrived , wrote his letter to M. William Sanderson of London , concerning his voyage , as folioweth . 
 Ir , the Sunshine came into Dartmouth the fourth of this month : she hath be at Island , and from thence to Greenland , and so to Estotiland , from thence to Desolation , and to our Merchants , where she made trade with the people , staying in the country twentie days . They 
 have brought home five hundred seal skins , and and hundred and fortie half skins and pieces of skins . 
 I stand in great doubt of the pinnace , God be merciful 
 407 
 unto the poor men , and preserve them , if it be his blessed will . 
 I have now experience of much of thee Northwest part of the world , & have brought the passage to that likelihood , as that I am assured it must be in one of foure places , or else not at all . And further I can assure you upon the peril of my life , that this voyage may be performed without further charge , nay with certain profit to the adventurers , if I may have but your favour in the actium . I hope I shall find favour with you to see your Card. I pray God it be so true as the Carded shall be which I will bring you : and I hope in God , that your skill in Navigation shall be gaineful unto you , although at the first it hath not proved so . And thus with my humble commendations I commit you to God , desiring no longer to live , then I shall be yours most faithfully to command . Exon this fourteenth of October . 1586. 
 Yours to command 
 John Davis .
