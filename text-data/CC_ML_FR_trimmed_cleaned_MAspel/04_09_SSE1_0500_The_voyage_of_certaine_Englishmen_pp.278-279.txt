Certain Englishmen sent to Constantinople by the French King to Justinian the Emperor , about the year of Christ , 500. out of the fourth book of Procopius de Bello Gothico . 
 Ritanniam insulam tres numerosissimae gentes incolunt : Quorum unicuique suus Rex imperat . Nominantur hae gentes Angili , Frisones , & qui ejusdem sunt cum insula cognominis Britones . Tanta vero hominum multitudo esse videtur , ut singulis annis inde magno numero cum 
 uxoribus & liberis ad Francos emigrent . Illi autem in eorum terram , quae maximi deserta videtur , excipiunt . Unde insulam sibi vendicare ferunt . Utique non ita pridem , cum Francorum Rex quosdam e suis Constan-tinopolim and Justinianum legaret , Anglos etiam misit , ambitiosius vendicans , quasi haec insula suo subesset imperio . 
 The same in English . 
 THe Isle of Britaine is inhabited by three most populous nations , every of which is governed by a several king . The said nations are nam Angili , Frisones , and Britones , which last are called after the name of the Island . In this Isle there are such swarms of people , that every year they go forth in great numbers with their wives and children into France . And the Frenchmen right willingly receive them into their land , which seems very desolate for want of inhabitants . Whereupon it is said that the French do challenge the foresaid Island unto themselves . For not long since , when the king of the Frankes sent certain of his subject's ambassadors to Constantinople unto Justinian the Emperor , he sent English men also , am-278 
 bitiously boasting , as though the said Isle had be under his jurisdiction .
