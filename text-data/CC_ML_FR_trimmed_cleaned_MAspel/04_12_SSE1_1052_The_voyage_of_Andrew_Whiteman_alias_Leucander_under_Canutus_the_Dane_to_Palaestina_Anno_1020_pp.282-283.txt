The travails of Andrew Whiteman alias Leucander , Centur. 2. 
 Ndrasas Leucander alias Whiteman ( juxta Lelandum ) Monachus , & Abbas Rame-siensis Caenobii tertius fuit . Hic bonis artibus study quodam incredibili noctes atque dies invigilabat , & operae praecium ingens inde retulit . Accessit praeterea & ardens quoddam desiderium , ea propriis 
 & apertis oculis videndi loca , in quibus Servator Christus redemptionis nostrae mysteria omnia consummavit , quorum prius sola nomina ex scripturarum lectione noverat : unde & sacram Hierosolymorum urbem , miraculorum , praedicationis , ac passionis ejus testem invisit , atque domum rediens factus est Abbas . Claruisse fertur anno nati Servatoris , 1020. sub Canuto Dano .

 ANdrew Leucander otherwise called Whiteman ( as Leland reporteth ) was by profession a Monk , and the third Abbot of the Abbey of Ramsie : he was exceedingly given to the study of good arts , taking pains therein day & night , and profited greatly thereby . And among all other things , he had and incredible desire to see those places with his eyes , wherein Christ our Saviour performed and wrought all the mysteries of our redemption , the names of which places he only knew before by the reading of the Scriptures . Whereupon he began his journey , and went to Jeru-282 
 salem a witness of the miracles , preaching , and passion of Christ , and being again returned into his country , he was made the aforesaid Abbot . He flourished in the year of Christ 1020. under Canutus the Dane .
