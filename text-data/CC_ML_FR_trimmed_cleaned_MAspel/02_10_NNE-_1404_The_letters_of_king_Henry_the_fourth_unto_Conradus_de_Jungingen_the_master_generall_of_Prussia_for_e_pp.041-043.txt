The letters of king Henry the 4. unto Conradus de Jungingen the master general of Prussia , for mutual conversation and intercourse of traffic to continue between the merchants of England and of Prussia , for a certain term of time . 
 Enry by the grace of God , king of England & France , and lord of Ireland , to the noble and mighty personage of sacred religion , Frater Conradus de Jungingen Master general of the Order of the Dutch knights of S. marry etc. our most deer and well-beloved friend , greeting , and continual increase of our 
 ancient and sincere amity . By the grievous complaints of our liege subject's concerning traffic , as it were circularwise too & from both our dominions , we have often 
 be advertised that in regard of diverse injuries and damages , which as well our as your merchants ( who by their dealings in merchandise were wont peaceably to use mutual conversation together , whereupon very many commodities are known to have proceeded ) have , by occasion of pirates , roving up and down the sea , sometime heretofore sustained : both the said merchants of our & of your dominions do abstain themselves from their wonted mutual conversation & traffic , as they have likewise carefully abstained at sometime heretofore , and especially from that time , wherein at the instant request of your messengers , being of late before our presence , the free access of our merchants unto your territories and dominions , & of your merchants unto our realms hath be forbidden . Since therefore 
 The ancient friendship between England and Prussia . 
 ( our most deer friend ) such injuries ( if any ) as have be attempted against your subject's , were never committed by our will and consent , as we think that your self on the other side have done the like : since also , so much as in us lies , we are ready to exhibit full justice with favour unto any of your people being desirous to make complaint , so that accordingly justice may equally be done unto our merchants by you & your subject's , which merchants have in like sort be injuried , wishing with all our heart , that the ancient friendship & love , which hath continued a long time between our realm and your territories and dominions , may persevere in time to come , and that sweet and acceptable peace , which is to be embraced of all Christians , may according to the good pleasure of the author of peace , be nourished & maintained : we do most heartily require the said friendship , exhorting you in the Lord that you would on your behalf consent & ordain ( even as , if you shall so do , we for our part will consent likewise ) that from this present until the feast of Easter next ensuing ( all molestations & injuries which may be offered ceasing on both parts ) our subject's by your territories & dominions , & your subject's by our realms , may peaceably & securely travel , & that according to their wonted manner , they may friendly converse & exercise mutual traffic together : because we are determined to send unto you & your counsel in the mean time some of our ambassadors , friendly to entreat about the foresaid pretended injuries , so far forth as they shall concern our subject's . At whose arrival we stand in good hope that by the due administration of justice on both parts , such order ( by Gods assistance ) shall taken , that mutual peace and tranquillity may be established between us in times to come . Also our desire is in particular , that our merchants & liege subject's may have more free passage granted them unto the parts of Sconia , for the providing of herrings and of other fish there , that they may there remain , and from thence also may more securely return unto their own home : and we 
 beseech you in consideration of our own selves , that you would have our merchants and liege subject's especially recommended unto you , safely protecting them ( if need shall require ) under the shadow of your defence : even as you would have us to deal in the like case with your own subject's . Moreover , whatsoever you shall think good to put in practice in this behalf , may it please you of your friendship , by our faithful subject John brown the bearer hereof to give us to understand . In the son of the glorious virgin fare you well , with continual prosperity and felicity according to your own hearts desire . Given under our privy seal , at our palace of Westminster , the fift day of June , and in the fift year of our reign . 
 Postscriptum . 
 Right reverend and our most deer friend : albeit our well-beloved Arnold de Dassele the procurator of your foresaid messengers , being desirous at this time to make his final return unto your parts , by reason of the afiayres , for which he hath remained in our realm of England , cannot as yet obtain his wished expedition : notwithstanding you of your sincere affection ought not to marvel or any whit to be grieved thereat : because troubles of wars arising , which in some sort concerned our selves , and especially in regard of the continual assaults of the French men & Britons against us and our kingdom , for the offence of whom , and our own defence , our liege subject's ( especially they , of whom your subject's damnified have made their complaints ) have armed themselves to combat upon the sea : we could not grant unto the foresaid Arnold such and so speedy and expedition , as he earnestly desired to have . Unto the which Arnold your procurator we have offered in as short time as may be , to administer complete justice with favour , to you end that for this cause he might dispose himself to remain in our realm of England : & yet notwithstanding we would do the very same even in the absence of the said procurator . Given as above .
