 Obertus Ketenensis nation & cognomine Anglus , degustatis primum per Anglorum gymnasia humanarum artium elementis literariis , ultramarinas statim visitare provincias in animo constituit : Peragratis ergo Galliis , Italia , Dalmatia , & Graecia , tum demum pervenit in Asiam , ubi non 
 parvo labour , ac vitae suae periculo inter Saracenos truculentissimum hominum genus , Arabicam linguam ad amussim didicit . In Hispaniam postea navigio traductus , circa fluvium Hiberum Astrologicae artis study , Claruit sub cum Hermanno quodam Dalmata , magni sui itineris Stephana . eomite se totum dedit . Claruit anno servatoris nostri , 1143 Stephano regnante , & Pampilonae sepelitur . 
 The same in English . 
 THis Robert Ketenensis was called and Englishman by surname , as he was by birth : who after some time spent in the foundations of humanity , and in the 308 
 elements of good Arts in the Universities of England , determined to travail to the parts beyond sea : and so travailed through France , Italie , Dalmatia , and Greece , and came at last into Asia , where he lived in great danger of his life among the cruel Saracens , but yet learned perfectly the Arabian tongue . Afterwards he returned by sea into Spaine , and there about the river Iberus , gave him self wholly to the study of Astrology , with one Hermannus a Dalmatian , who had accompanied him in his long voyage . He flourished in the year 1143. Steven being then King of England , and was buried at Pampilona .
