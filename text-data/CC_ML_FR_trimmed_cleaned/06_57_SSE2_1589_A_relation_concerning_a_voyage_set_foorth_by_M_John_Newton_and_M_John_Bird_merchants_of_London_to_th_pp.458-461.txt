The voiage set forth by M. John Newton, and M. John Bird marchants of London to the kindome and Citie of Benin in Africa, with a ship called the Richard of Arundell, and a pinnesse, in the yere 1588. briefely set downe in this letter following, written by the chiefe Factor in the voyage to the foresaid Marchants at the time of the ships first arrivall at Plimouth.{n}Orshipful Sirs, the discourse of our whole proceeding in this voyage wil aske more time and a person in better health then I am at this present, so that I trust you will pardon me, till my comming up to you: in the meane time let this suffice. Whereas we departed in the{n}moneth of December from the coast of England with your good ship the Richard of Arundell and the pinnesse, we held on our direct course towards our appointed port, and the 14 day of Februarie following we arrived in the haven of Benin, where we found not water enough to carry the ship over the barre, so that we left her without in the road, and with the pinnesse & ship boat, into which we had put the chiefest of our mar-chandise, we went up the river to a place called Goto, where we arrived the 20 of February, the foresaid Goto being the neerest place that we could come to by water, to go for Benin. From thence we presently sent Negroes to the king, to certifie him of our arrivall, and of the cause of our comming thither: who returned to us againe the 22 day with a noble man in their 458{n}. . i589‘ company to bring us up to the Citie, and with 200 Negroes to carrie our commodities: hereupon the 23 day we delivered our marchandize to the kings Factor, & the 25 day we came to the great Citie of Benin, The great where we were well intertained: The sixe & twenty cttte °fBentn-day we went to the Court to have spoken with the king, which (by reason of a solemne feast then kept amongst them) we could not doe: but yet we spake with his Veadore, or chiefe man, that hath the dealing with the Christians: and we conferred with him concerning our trading, who answered us, that we should have all things to our desire, both in pepper and Elephants teeth.{n}The first of March we were admitted to the kings presence, and he made us the like courteous answere For our traffike: the next day we went againe to the Court, where the foresaid Veadore shewed us one basket of greene pepper, and another of dry in the stalkes: wee desired to have it plucked from the stalks and made cleane, who answered, that it would aske time, but yet it should be done: and that against ■ another yeere it should be in better readines, & the reason why we found it so unprepared was, because in this kings time no Christians had ever resorted thither, to lade pepper. The next day there were sent us 12 baskets, and so a litle every day untill the 9 of March at which time we had made upon 64 serons of pepper, and 28 Elephants teeth. In this time of our being at Benin (our natures at this first time not so well acquainted with that climate) we fell all of us into the disease of the fever, whereupon the Captaine sent me downe with those goods which we alreadie had received, to the rest of our men at Goto: where being arrived, I found all the men of our pinnesse sicke also, and by reason of their weaknes not able to convey the pinnesse and goods downe to the place where our ship [II. ii. 150.] road: but by good hap within two houres after my comming to Goto, the boate came up from the ship,{n}459{n}to see how all things stood with us, so that I put the goods into the boat, and went downe towards the s ip• but by that time I was come aboord, many of our men died: namely, Master Benson, the Cooper, the Carpenter, & 3 or 4 more, & my selfe was also in such a weake state that I was not able to returne againe to Benin. Whereupon I sent up Samuel Dunne, and the Chirurgian with him to our men, that were about to let them blood, if it were thought needful!: who at their comming to Benin, found the Captaine and your sonne William Bird dead, and Thomas Hempsteede very weake, who also died within two dayes after their comming thither. This sorrowfull accident caused them with such pepper and teeth, as they could then find, speedily to returne to the ship, as by the Cargason will appeare: at their comming away the Veadore tolde them, that if they could or would stay any longer time, he would use all possible expedition to bring in more commodities: but the common sicknesse so increased and continued amongst us all, that by the time our men which remained were come aboord, we had so many sicke and dead of our companie, that we looked all for the same happe, and so thought to loose both our ship, life, countrey and all. Very hardly and with much adoe could we get up our ankers, but yet at the last by the mercie of God having gotten them up, but leaving our pinnesse behinde us, we got to sea, and set saile, which was upon the 13 of Aprill. After which by little and little our men beganne to gather up their crums and to recover some better strength: and so sailing betwixt the Islands of Cape Verde, and the maine we came to the Islands of the Azores upon the 25 of July, where our men beganne a fresh to grow ill, and divers died, among whom Samuel Dun was one, and as many as remained living were in a hard case: but in the midst of our distresse, it fell so wel out, by Gods good providence, that we met with your ship the Barke Burre, on this side the North cape, 460{n}1590. which did not only keepe us good companie, but also sent us sixe fresh men aboord, without whose helpe, we should surely have tasted of many inconveniences.{n}But by this good meanes we are now at the last arrived in Plimouth, this 9 day of September: and for want of better health at this time, I referre the further knowledge of more particularities, till my com-ming to London.{n}Yours to commaund{n}Anthony Ingram.{n}
