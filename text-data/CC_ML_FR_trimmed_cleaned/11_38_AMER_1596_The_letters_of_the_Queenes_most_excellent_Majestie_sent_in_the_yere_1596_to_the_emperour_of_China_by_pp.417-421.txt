The letters of the Queenes most excellent Majestie sent in the yere 1596 unto the great Emperor of China by M. Richard Allot and M. Thomas Bromefield marchants of the citie of London, who were embarqued in a fleet of 3 ships, to wit, The Beare, The Beares whelpe, and the Benjamin; set forth principally at the charges of the honourable knight Sir Robert Duddely, and committed unto the command and conduct of M. Benjamin Wood, a man of ap-prooved skill in navigation: who, together with his ships and company (because we have heard no certaine newes of them since the moneth of February next after their departure) we do suppose, may be arrived upon some part of the coast of China, and may there be stayed by the said Emperour, or perhaps may have some treacherie wrought against them by the Portugales of Macao, or the Spaniards of the Philippinas.{n}Lizabetha Dei gracia Angliae, Franciae, & Hiberniae Regina, verae & christianae fidei contra omnes falso Christi nomen profitentes invictissima propugnatrix &c.
