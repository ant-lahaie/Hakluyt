Certaine Englishmen sent to Constantinople by the French King to Justinian the Emperor, about the yeere of Christ, 500. out of the fourth booke of Procopius de Bello Gothico.{n}Ritanniam insulam tres numerosissimae gentes incolunt: Quorum unicuique suus Rex imperat. Nominantur hae gentes Angili, Frisones, & qui ejusdem sunt cum insula cognominis Britones. Tanta vero hominum multitudo esse videtur, ut singulis annis inde magno numero cum{n}uxoribus & liberis ad Francos emigrent. Illi autem in eorum terram, quae maximi deserta videtur, excipiunt. Unde insulam sibi vendicare ferunt. Utique non ita pridem, cum Francorum Rex quosdam e suis Constan-tinopolim ad Justinianum legaret, Anglos etiam misit, ambitiosius vendicans, quasi haec insula suo subesset imperio.{n}	The same in English.{n}THe Isle of Britaine is inhabited by three most populous nations, every of which is governed by a severall king. The sayd nations are named Angili, Frisones, and Britones, which last are called after the name of the Island. In this Isle there are such swarmes of people, that every yeere they goe foorth in great numbers with their wives and children into France. And the Frenchmen right willingly receive them into their lande, which seemeth very desolate for want of inhabitants. Whereupon it is sayd that the French doe challenge the foresayd Island unto themselves. For not long since, when the king of the Frankes sent certaine of his subjects ambassadours to Constantinople unto Justinian the Emperour, he sent English men also, am-278{n}bitiously boasting, as though the sayd Isle had bene under his jurisdiction.{n}
