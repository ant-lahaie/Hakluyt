Lib. 11. cap. 7.{n}Ortiporio successit Malgo, omnium fere Britanniae pulcherrimus, multorum tyrannorum depulsor, robustus armis, largior caeteris, & ultra modum{n}probitate praeclarus. Hic etiam totam Insulam obtinuit, & sex conprovinciales Oceani Insulas : Hyberniam videlicet, atque Islandiam, Gotlandiam, Orcades, Noruegiam, Daciam, adjecit dirissimis praeliis potestati suae.{n}A It Algo succeeded Vortiporius which was the goodliest EVA man in person of all Britaine, a prince that expulsed many tyrants. He was strong and valiant in warre, taller then most men that then lived, and exceeding famous for his vertues. This king also obteined the government of the whole Island of Britaine, and by most sharpe battailes he recovered to his Empire the sixe Islands of the Ocean sea, which before had bene made tributaries by king Arthur, namely Ireland, Island, Gotland, Orkney, Norway, and Denmarke.{n}
