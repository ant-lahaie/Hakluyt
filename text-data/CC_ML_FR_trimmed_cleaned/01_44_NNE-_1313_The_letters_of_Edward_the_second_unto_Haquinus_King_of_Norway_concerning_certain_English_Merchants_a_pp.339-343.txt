De mercatoribus Angliae in Norwegia arestatis, & eorum mercimoniis de arrestandis literse Edwardi secundi anno sexto regni sui, Haquino regi Norwegian.{n}Agnifico principi domino Haquino Dei gratia regi Norwegiae illustri, amico suo charissimo Edwardus ------eadem Dei gratia rex Angliae, Dom. Hiberniae, & dux Aquitaniae salutem cum dilectione sincera. Miramur{n}non modicum & in intimis conturbamur de gravaminibus{n}& oppressionibus quae subditis nostris infra regnum  vestrum causa negociandi venientibus his diebus plus solito absque causa rationabili, sicut ex gravi querela didicimus, inferuntur. Nuper siquidem Willihelmus filius Laurentii de Waynfleete, Simon filius Alani de eadem, Guido filius Mathei & eorum socii mercatores nostri nobis conquerendo monstrarunt, quod cum ipsi quosdam homines & servientes suos cum tribus navibus suis ad partes regni vestri, ad negotiandum ibidem transmisissent: & naves illae in portu villae vestrae de Villa de Tonnesbergh halece & aliis bonis diversis usque ad Tonnesbergh. magnam summam oneratae fuissent: Et licet nautis navium praedictarum hominibusque & servientibus praedictis a regno vestro libere cum navibus & bonis praedictis ad partes Angliae redeundi vestras fieri feceritis de conductu, postmodum tamen antequam naves illae propter venti contrarietatem portum praedictum exire potuerunt, quidam ballivi vestri naves praedictas cum hominibus & bonis omnibus tunc existentibus in eisdem, occasione{n}mortis cujusdam militis nuper ballivi vestri in Vikia per malefactores & piratas, dum naves praedictae in portu supradicto sicut praemittitur remanserunt supra mare ut dicitur interfecti, de mandato vestro ut dicebant arrest-arunt, & diu sub aresto hujusmodi detinebant, quousque videlicet homines & marinarii praedicti de quadraginta{n}339{n}libris sterlingorum certo die statuto ad opus vestrum pro qualibet navi praedictarum solvendis inviti & coacti securitatem invenissent : Et similiter de eisdem navibus cum hominibus praedictis infra portum praedictum citra festum nativitatis Sancti Joannis Baptistae proximo futuro ad standum tunc ibidem de personis & navibus suis vestrae gratiae seu voluntatis arbitrio reducendis tres obsides ulterius liberassent : quod ipsis valde grave censetur, & auditu mirabile auribus audientium non immerito reputatur. Et quia contra rationem & aequitatem, omnemque justitiam fore dinoscitur, atque legem, quod delinquentium culpae seu demerita in personis vel rebus illorum qui criminis rei conscii vel participes, seu de hujusmodi delinquentium societate non fuerunt, aliqualiter ulciscantur, vestram amicitiam affectuose requirimus & rogamus, quatenus praemissa diligenti meditatione zelo justitiae ponderantes, obsides praedictos jubere velitis ab hostagiamento hujusmodi liberari, dictamque securitatem relaxari penitus & resolvi. Scientes pro certo, quod si malefactores praedicti, qui dictum militem vestrum, ut dicitur, occiderunt, alicubi infra regnum seu potestatem nostram poterunt inveniri, de ipsis justitiam & judicium secundum legem & consuetudinem ejusdem regni fieri faciemus. Non enim possumus his diebus aequanimiter tolerare, quod naves praedictae seu aliae de regno nostro, quae semper promptae ad nostrum servitium esse debent, extra idem regnum ad partes remotas se divertant sine nostra licentia speciali. Quid autem ad hanc nostram instantiam faciendum decreveritis in praemissis, nobis si placeat rescribatis per praesentium portatorem. Datae apud Windesore decimo sexto die Aprilis.{n}34Â°{n}The letters of Edward the second unto Haquinus king of Norway, concerning the English marchants arrested in Norway, and their goods to be freed from arrest.{n}O the mighty Prince, lord Haquinus, by the grace of God the famous king of Norway his most deare friend, Edward by the same grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Aquitaine, greeting and sincere love. We marvell not a little, and are much dis-{n}quieted in our cogitations, considering the greevances and oppressions, which (as wee have beene informed by pitifull complaints) are at this present, more then in times past, without any reasonable cause inflicted upon our subjects, which doe usually resort unto your kingdome for traffiques sake. For of late one William the sonne of Laurence of Wainfleete, and one Simon the sonne of Alan of the same towne, and Guido the sonne of Mathew, and their associates our marchants, in complayning wise declared unto us : that having sent certaine of their factors and servants, with three shippes into your dominions, there to exercise traffique, and the sayd ships being laden in the haven of your towne of Tonnesbergh, with Herrings and other commodities, to a great value : and also the said mariners, men, and servants of the foresayd shippes, being licenced by vertue of the safe conduct which you had granted them, freely to returne from your kingdome unto the parts of England with their ships and goods aforesayd, but afterward not being able to depart out of your haven by reason of contrary windes : certaine of your bayliffes upon occasion of the slaughter of a knight being himselfe also of late your bayliffe of Vikia, committed by malefactors and Pirates upon the sea, whilest the sayd shippes remained in the haven aforesayd, 341{n}The towne of Tonesbergh.{n}did at your commandement (as they say) arrest, and for a long season also deteined under that arrest, the foresaid{n} ships, with all the men and goods that were in them : namely untill such time, as the men and mariners afore-saide (beeing driven perforce, and constrained thereunto) should lay in sufficient securitie for the payment of fortie pounds sterling, upon a certain day appointed, unto your use, for every of the foresaide ships : and also untill they had moreover delivered three pledges, for the bringing of the saide ships and men backe againe into the foresaid haven, before the feast of the nativitie of S. John the Baptist next ensuing, then and there to stand unto your favour and curtesie, as touching the said persons, and those ships of theirs: which dealing, the parties themselves take very grievously, yea, and all others that heare thereof thinke it to be a strange and unwonted course. And because it is most undoubtedly contrary to all reason, equitie, justice, and lawe, that the faults or demerits of offenders should in any sort be punished in such persons, or in their goods, as neither have bene accessory nor partakers in the crime, nor have had any society with the saide offenders : we doe heartily intreat and request your Highnes, that weighing and pondering the matter in the balance of justice, you would of your love and friendship, command the foresaid pledges to be set at libertie, and the said securitie utterly to bee released and acquited. And know you this for a certaintie, that if the foresaide malefactors, who (as it is reported) slewe your Knight aforesaide, shall any where within our realme and dominions be found, we wil cause justice and judgement to bee executed upon them, according to the Lawe and custome of our say de Realme. For we cannot in these times conveniently and well indure, that the ships aforesaide, or any other ships of our kingdome (which ought alwayes to be in a readinesse for our service) should without speciali licence, depart out of our saide kingdome, unto forreine dominions. Nowe, what you shall think good at this our request to performe in the premisses,{n}342{n}may it please you by the bearer of these presents to returne an answere unto us. Geven at Windsore the 16. of April.{n}
