The voyage of Nicholas de Lynna a Franciscan Frier, and an excellent Mathematician of Oxford, to all the Regions situate under the North pole, in the yeere 1360. and in the raigne of Edward the 3. king of England.{n}The words of Gerardus Mercator, in the foote of his general Map, upon the description of the Uorth partes.{n}Uod ad descriptionem partium Septentrionalium attinet, eam nos accipimus ex Itinerario Jacobi Cnoyen Buscodu-censis, qui quaedam ex rebus gestis Arthuri Britanni citat, majorem autem partem & potiora, a Sacerdote quodam apud Regem Noruegiae, An. Dom. 1364.{n}didicit. Descenderat is ex illis quos Arthurus ad has habitandas insulas miserat, & referebat, An. 1360. Mino-ritam quendam Anglum Oxoniensem Mathematicum in eas insulas venisse, ipsisque relictis ad ulteriora arte Magica profectum descripsisse omnia, & Astrolabio dimensum esse in hanc subjectam formam fere, uti ex Jacobo collegimus. Euripos illos quatuor dicebat tanto impetu ad interiorem voraginem rapi, ut naves semel ingressae nullo vento retroagi possent, neque vero unquam tantum ibi ventum esse, ut molae frumentariae circumagendae sufficiat. Simillima his habet Giraldus 301{n}Cambrensis (qui floruit, An. 1210.) in libro de mirabilibus Hyberniae, sic enim scribit. Non procul ab insulis Hebridibus, Islandia, &c. ex parte Boreali, est maris quaedam miranda vorago, in quam a remotis partibus omnes undique fluctus marini tanquam ex condicto fluunt, & recurrunt, qui in secreta naturae penetralia se ibi transfundentes, quasi in Abyssum vorantur. Si vero navem h^c forte transire contigerit, tanta rapitur, & attrahitur fluctuum violentia, ut eam statim irrevocabiliter vis voracitatis absorbeat.{n}Quatuor voragines hujus Oceani, a quatuor oppositis mundi partibus Philosophi describunt, unde & tam marinos fluctus, quam & ASolicos flatus causaliter pervenire nonnulli conjectant.{n}	The same in English.{n}TOuching the description of the North partes, I have taken the same out of the voyage of James Cnoyen of Hartzevan Buske, which alleageth certaine conquests of Arthur king of Britaine: and the most part, and chiefest things among the rest, he learned of a certaine priest in the king of Norwayes court, in the yeere 1364. This priest was descended from them which king Arthur had sent to inhabite these Islands, and he reported that in the yeere 1360, a certaine English Frier, a Franciscan, and a Mathematician of Oxford, came into those Islands, who leaving them, and passing further by his Magical! Arte, described all those places that he sawe, and tooke the height of them with his Astrolabe, according to the forme that I (Gerard Mercator) have set downe in my mappe, and as I have taken it out of the aforesaid James Cnoyen. Hee sayd that those foure Indraughts were drawne into an inward gulfe or whirlepoole, with so great a force, that the ships which once entred therein, could by no meanes be driven backe againe, and that there is never in those parts so much winde blowing, as might be sufficient to drive a Corne mill.{n}Giraldus Cambrensis (who florished in the yeere 1210,{n}302{n}under king John) in his booke of the miracles of Ireland, hath certaine words altogether alike with these, videlicet:{n}Not farre from these Islands (namely the Hebrides, Island &c.) towards the North there is a certaine woonderful whirlpoole of the sea, whereinto all the waves of the sea from farre have their course and recourse, as it were without stoppe: which, there conveying themselves into the secret receptacles of nature, are swallowed up, as it were, into a bottomlesse pit, and if it chance that any shippe doe passe this way, it is pulled, and drawen with such a violence of the waves, that eftsoones without remedy, the force of the whirlepoole devoureth the same.{n}The Philosophers describe foure indraughts of this Ocean sea, in the foure opposite quarters of the world, from whence many doe conjecture that as well the flowing of the sea, as the blasts of the winde, have their first originali.{n}A.D.{n}1360.{n}There is a notable whirlepoole on the coast of Norway, called Malestrande, about the latitude of 68.{n}
