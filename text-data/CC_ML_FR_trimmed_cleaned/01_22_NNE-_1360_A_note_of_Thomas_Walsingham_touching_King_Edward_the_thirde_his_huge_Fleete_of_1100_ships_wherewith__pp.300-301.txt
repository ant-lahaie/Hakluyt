A note out of Thomas Walsingham touching the huge Fleete of eleven hundred well furnished ships wherewith king Edward the third passed over unto Calais in the yeere *359-{n}AN no gratias 1359. Johannes Rex Franciae sub umbra pacis, & dolose obtulit Regi Angliae Flandriam, Picardiam, Aquitaniam, aliasque terras quas equitaverat & vastarat: pro quibus omnibus ratificandis idem Rex Edwardus in Franciam nuncios suos direxit; quibus omnibus Franci contradixerunt. Unde motus Rex Anglias, celeriter se & suos praeparavit ad transfretandum, ducens secum principem Walliae Edwardum suum primogenitum, ducem Henricum Lancastriae, & fere proceres omnes, quos comitabantur vel sequebantur poene mille currus, habuitque apud Sanwicum instructas optime undecies centum naves, & cum hoc apparatu ad humiliandum Francorum fastum Franciam navigavit, relicto domino Thoma de Woodstock filio suo juniore admodum parvulo, Anglici regni custode, sub tutela tamen.{n}The same in English.{n}IN the yeere of our Lord 1359. John the French king craftily, and under pretence of peace, offered unto Edward the third king of England, Flanders, Picardie, Gascoigne, and other territories which he had spoyled and wasted: for the ratifying of which agreement, the foresaid king Edward sent his ambassadors into France, but the Frenchmen gainsaied them in all their articles and 300{n}demaunds. Whereupon the king of England being provoked, speedily prepared himselfe and his forces to crosse the seas, carying with him Edward Prince of Wales his heire apparant, and Henry duke of Lancaster and almost all his Nobles, with a thousand wagons and cartes attending upon them. And the said king had at Sandwich eleven hundred ships exceedingly well furnished: with which preparation he passed over the seas, to abate the Frenchmens arrogancie: leaving his yonger sonne Thomas of Woodstocke, being very tender of age, as his vicegerent in the Realme of England; albeit not without a protectour, &c.{n}
