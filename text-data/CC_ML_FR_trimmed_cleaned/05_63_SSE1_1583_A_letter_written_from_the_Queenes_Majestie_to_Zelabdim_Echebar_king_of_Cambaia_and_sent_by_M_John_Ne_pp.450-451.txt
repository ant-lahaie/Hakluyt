A letter written from the Queenes Majestie, to Zelabdim Echebar, King of Cambaia, and sent by John Newbery. In February Anno 1583.{n}Lizabeth by the grace of God, &c. To the most invincible, and most mightie prince, lord Zelabdim Echebar king of Cambaya. Invincible Emperor, &c. The great affection which our Subjects have, to visit the most distant places of the world, not without good will and in-{n}tention to introduce the trade of marchandize of al nations whatsoever they can, by which meanes the mutual and friendly trafique of marchandize on both sides may come, is the cause that the bearer of this letter John Newbery, joyntly with those that be in his company, with a curteous and honest boldnesse, doe repaire to the borders and countreys of your Empire, we doubt not but that your imperial Majestie through your royal grace, will favourably and friendly accept him. And that you would doe it the rather for our sake, to make us greatly beholding to your Majestie ; wee should more earnestly, and with more wordes require it, if wee did think it needful. But by the singular report that is of your imperial Majesties humanitie in these uttermost parts of the world, we are greatly eased of that burden, and therefore we use the fewer and lesse words: onely we request that because they are our subjects, they may be honestly intreated and received. And that in respect of the hard journey which they have undertaken to places so far distant, it would please your Majestie with 45Â°{n}some libertie and seen ri tie of voiage to gratifie it, with such privileges as to you shall seeme good: which cur-tesie if your Imperiali majestie shal to our subjects at our requests performe, wee, according to our royall honour, wil recompence the same with as many deserts as we can. And herewith we bid your Imperial Majestie to farewel.{n}
