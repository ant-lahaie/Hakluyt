Theise word be take heavy of all the company , and no man will answer he , but keep silence , for very grief to see my lord hope thus deceive , and his great expense and cost cast away . the common sort see no other remedy , be content to return as well as he . the 16 day we espy a sail , whereupon our pinnace and dalamor give her chase , and put she ashore upon the island , where the man forsake she , and run away with such thing as they can convenient carry : [ Hi . 778 . ] our pinnace board she , and find little in she ; they another pin - tooke out of her nine chest of sugar , and one hog , ness taken - and 35 piece of pewter , and so leave she upon the sand . from this time forward we begin to ply northwards , july - and the first of July fall with the land again , where we they return fish , and find reasonable good store . i take the Â° ri war ' latitude that day , and find our self in 10 degree and 22 minute . the 7 day we determine to fall with Fernambuck , and we come so near it , that dalamor ( as he tell we ) espy some of the ship that be in the harbour : yet notwithstanding we all fall to leeward of the river , and can not after that , by any mean recover the height of it again : but we cease not on all part to xi 225 p fernambuck in the southerly latitude of 7 deg . 50 min . a low island in 3 degree and 49 minute .
