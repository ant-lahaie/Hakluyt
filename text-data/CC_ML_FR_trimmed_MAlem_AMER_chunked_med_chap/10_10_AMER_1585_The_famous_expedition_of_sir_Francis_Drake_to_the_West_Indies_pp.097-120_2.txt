have take his head and heart , and have straggle the other bowel about the place , in a most brutish and beastly manner . in revenge whereof at our depart we consume with fire all the house , aswell in the country which we see , as in the town of saint Iago . from hence put off to the west Indies , we be not many day at sea , but there begin among our people such mortality , as in few day there be dead above two or three hundred man . and until some seven or eight day after our come from saint Iago , there have not die any one man of sickness in all the fleet : the sickness show not his infection wherewith so many be strike , until we be depart thence , and then seize our people with extreme hot burn and continual ague , whereof very few escape with life , and yet those for the most part not without great alteration and decay of their wit and strength for a long time after . in some that die be plain show the small spot , which be often find upon those that [ three . 539 . ] be infect with the plague : we be not above eighteen day in passage between the sight of saint Iago aforesaid , and the island of Dominica , be the 109 first island of the west Indies that we fall withal , the same be inhabit with savage people , which go all naked , their skin colour with some paint of a reddish tawny , very personable and handsome strong man , who do admit little conversation with the Spaniard : for as some of our people may understand they , they have a Spaniard or twain prisoner with they , neither do i think that there be any safety for any of our nation , or any other to be within the limit of their commandment , albeit they use we very kind for those few hour of time which we spend with they , help our folk to fill and carry on their bare shoulder fresh water from the river to our ship boat , and fetch from their house great store of tobacco , as also a kind of bread which they feed on , call Cassavi , very white and savoury , make of the root of Cassavi . in recompense whereof , we bestow liberali reward of glass , colour bead , and other thing , which we have find at saint Iago , wherewith ( as it seem ) they rest very great satisfy , and show some sorrowful countenance when they perceive that we will depart . from hence we go to another island westward of it , call saint Christopher island , wherein we spend some day of Christmas , to refresh our sick people , and to cleanse and air our ship . in which island be not any people at all that we can hear of . in which time by the general it be advise and resolve , with the consent of the lieutenant general , the vice - admiral , and all the rest of the captain to proceed to the great island of Hispaniola , aswell for that we know our self then to be in our best strength , as also the rather allure thereunto , by the glorious fame of the ci tie of saint Domingo , be the ancient and chief inhabit place in all the tract of country thereabouts . and so proceed in this determination , by the way we meet a small frigate , bind for the same place , the which the viceadmiral take : and have due examine the man that be in she , iio there be one find , by who we be advertise , the haven to be a barren haven , and the shore or land thereof to be well fortify , have a castle thereupon furnish with great store of artillery , without the danger whereof be no convenient land place within ten english mile of the city , to which the say pilot take upon he to conduct we . all thing be thus consider on , the whole force be command in the evening to embark themselves in pinnace , boat , and other small bark appoint for this service . our soldier be thus embark , the general put himself into the bark Francis as admiral , and all this night we lie on the sea , bear small sail until our arrival to the land place , which be about the break of the day , and so we land , be newyeeres day , nine or ten mile to the westwards of that brave city of saint Domingo : for at that time nor yet be know to we any land place , where the sea - surge do not threaten to overset a pinnace or boat . Oure general have see we all land in safety , return to his fleet , bequeathe we to God , and the good conduct of master Carliell our lieutenant general : at which time , be about eight of the clock , we begin to march , and about noon time , or towards one of the clock , we approach the town , where the gentleman and those of the better sort , be some hundred and fifty brave horse or rather more , begin to present themselves ; but our small shot play upon they , which be so sustain with good proportion of pike in all part , as they find no part of our troop unprepared to receive they ( for you must understand they view all round about ) they be thus drive to give we leave to proceed towards the two gate of the town , which be the next to the seaward . they have man they both , and plant their ordinance for that present , and sudden alarm without the gate , and also some troop of small shot in ambuscado upon the high way side . we divide our whole force , be some thousand or twelve hundred man into two part , to enterprise both the gate at one instant , the lieutenant general have open vow to captain Powel ( who lead the troop that enter the other gate ) that with god good favour he will not rest until our meeting in the market place . their ordinance have no soon discharge upon our near approach , and make some execution among we , though not much , but the lieutenant general begin forthwith to advance both his voice of encouragement , and pace of march : the first man that be slay with the ordinance be very near unto himself : and thereupon haste all that he may , to keep they from the recharge of the ordinance . and notwithstanding their ambuscado , we march or rather run so roundly in to the city of they , as pell mell we enter the gate , and give they saint Domingo more care every man to save himself by flight , than ' reason to stand any long to their break fight . we forthwith repair to the market place : but to be more true understand , a place of very fair spacious square ground , whither also come as have be agree captain [ three . 540 . ] Powel with the other troop : which place with some part next unto it , we strengthen with Barricados , and there as the most convenient place assure our self , the city be far too spacious for so small and weary a troop to undertake to guard . somewhat after midnight , they who have the guard of the castle , hear we busy about the gate of the say castle , abandon the same : some be take prisoner , and some flee away by the help of boat to the other side of the haven , and so into the country . the next day we quarter a little more at large , but not into the half part of the town , and so make substantiali trench , and plant all the ordinance , that each part be correspondent to other , we hold this town the space of one month . in the which time happen some accident , more than be well remember for the present , but among other thing , it chance that the general send on his message 112 to the Spaniard a negro boy with a flag of white , signify truce , as be the Spaniard ordinary manner to do there , when they approach to speak to we : which boy unhappy be first meet withal by some of those , who have be belong as officer for the king in the spanish galley , which with the town be late fall into our hand , who without all order or reason , and contrary to that good usage wherewith we have entertained their messenger , furious strike the poor boy through the body with one of their horseman staff : with which wound the boy return to the general , and after he have declare the manner of this wrongful cruelty , die forthwith in his presence , wherewith the general be great passion , command the provost Martiali , to cause a couple of friar than prisoner , to be carry to the same place where the boy be strike , accompany with sufficient guard of our soldier , and there present to be hang , dispatch at the same instant another poor prisoner , with this reason wherefore this execution be do , and with this message further , that until the party who have thus murder the general messenger be deliver into our hand , to receive condign punishment , there shall not day pass , wherein there shall not two prisoner be hang , until they be all consume which be in our hand . whereupon the day follow , he that have be captain of the king galley , bring the offender to the town end , offer to deliver he into our hand ; but it be think to be a more honourable revenge to make they there in our sight , to perform the execution themselves : which be do accord . during our being in this town , as former also at saint Iago there have pass justice upon the life of one of our own company for a odious matter , so here likewise be there a Irishman hang , for the murder of his Corporali . in this time also pass many treaty between their commissioner and we , for ransom of their city ; but ten 113 h upon disagreement we still spend the early morning in fire the outmost house : but they be build very magnificent of stone , with high loft , give we not small travel to ruin they . and albeit for diverse day together we ordain each morning by day break , until the heat begin at nine of the dock , that two hundred mariner do nought else but labour to fire and burn the say house without our trench , while the soldier in a like proportion stand forth for their guard : yet do we not , or can not in this time consume so much as one three part of the town : which town be plain describe and set forth in a certain map and so in the end , what weary with fire , and what hasten by some other respect , we be content to accept of five and twenty thousand ducat of five shilling six penny the piece , for the ransom of the rest of the town . among other thing which happen and be find at saint Domingo , i may not omit to let the world know one very notable mark and token of the unsatiable ambition of the spanish king and his nation , which be find in the king house , wherein the chief governor of that city and country be appoint always to lodge , which be this : in the come to the hall or other room of this house , you must first ascend up by a fair large pair of stair ; at the head of which stair be a handsome spacious place to walk in , somewhat like unto a gallery : wherein upon one of the wall , right over against you as you enter the say place , so as your eye can escape the sight of it , there be describe and paint in a very large scutcheon the arm of the king of Spain , and in the low part of the say scutcheon , there be likewise describe a globe , contain in it the whole circuit of the sea and the earth whereupon be a horse stand on his hinder part within the globe , and the other forepart without the globe , lift up as it be to leap , with a scroll paint in his mouth , wherein be write these word in latin , non sufficit orbis : which be as much to say , as the world suffice not . whereof the meaning be require to be 114 1586 . know of some of those of the better sort , that come in commission to treat upon the ransom of the town , who will shake their head , and turn aside their countenance in some smile sort , without
