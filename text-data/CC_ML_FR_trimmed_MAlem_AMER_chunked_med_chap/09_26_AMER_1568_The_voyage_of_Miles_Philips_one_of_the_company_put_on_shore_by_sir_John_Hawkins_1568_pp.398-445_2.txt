self , and either 409 Chichimici a ■ warlike and truel people . the english voyage to sink or swim . and of those that so be ( as it be ) throw out , and compel to leap into the sea , there be two drown , which be of captain blands man . in the evening of the same day , it be Monday the eight of October , 1568 , when we be all come to shore , we find fresh water , whereof some of our man drink so much , that they have almost cast themselves away , for we can scarce get life of they for the space of two or three hour after : other sum be so cruel swell , what with the drink in of the salt water , and what with the eat of the fruit which we find on land , have a stone in it much like a almond ( which fruit be call capule ) that they be all in very ill case , so that we be in a manner all of we both feeble , faint and weak . the next morning be Tewsday , the nine of October , we think it best to travel along by the sea coast , to seek out some place of habitation : ( whether they be Christians or Savages , we be indifferent , so that we may have wherewithal ! to sustain our hungry body ) and so depart from a hill where we have rest all night , not have any dry thread about we , ( for those that be not wet being not throw into the sea , be thorough wet with rain , for all the night it rain cruel : ) as we go from the hill , and be come into the plain , we be great trouble to pass for the grass and weed that grow there high than any man . on the left hand we have the sea , and upon the right hand great wood , so that of necessity we must needs pass on our way westward , through those marsh ; and go thus , sudden we be assault by the Indian , a warlike kind of people , which be in a manner as cannibal , although they do not feed upon man flesh as cannibal do . Theise people be call Chichimici , and they use to wear their hair long , even down to their knee , they do also colour their face green , yellow , red and blue , 410 which make they to seem very ugly and terrible to behold . Theise people do keep war against the Spaniard , of who they have be oftentimes very cruel handle : for with the Spaniard there be no mercy . they perceive we at our first come on land , suppose we to have be their enemy , the border Spaniards , and have by their forerunner descry what number we be , and how feeble and weak without armour or weapon , they sudden accord to their accustom manner , when they encounter with any people in warlike sort , raise a terrible and huge cry , man as and so come run fierce upon we , shoot off their arrow as thick as hail , unto who mercy we be ’ constrain to yield , not have among we any kind of armour , nor yet weapon , save one caliver , and two old rusty sword , whereby to make any resistance , or to save our self : which when they perceive , that we seek not any other than favour and mercy at their hand , and that we be not their enemy the Spaniard , they have compassion on we , and come and cause we all to sit down : and when they have a while survey , and take a perfect view of we , they come to all such as have any colour clothes among we , and those they do strip stark naked , and take their clothes away with they , but those that be apparel in black they do not meddle withal , and so go their way , and leave we without do we any further hurt , only in the first brunt they kill eight of our man . eight of our And at our departure , they perceive in what weak slalne . case we be , point we with their hand which way we shall go to come to a town of the Spaniard , which as we afterward perceive , be not pass ten league from thence , use these word : tampice , tampice , Christiano , tampice Christiano , which be as much ( we think ) as to say in english , at tampice you shall find the Christians . the weapon that they use be no other but bow and arrow , and their [ three . 475 . ] arm be so good , that they very seidome miss to hit 411 any thing that they shoot at . Shortly after they have leave we strip ( as aforesaid ) we think it best to divide our self into two company , and so be separ - Anthony at , half of we go under the lead of one Anthony Godard . Godard , who be yet a man alive , and dwell at this instant in the town of Plymouth , who before we choose to be captain over we all , and those which go under his lead , of which number i mile Philips be one , travail westward that way which the Indian with their hand have before point we to go . the other half go under the lead of one John Hooper , who they do choose for their captain , and with the David company that go with he , David Ingram be one , Ingram . an ( j gy take their way and travel northward , and short after , within the space of two day , they be again encounter with the savage people , and their captain Hooper and two more of his company be slay : then again they divide themselves , and some hold on their way still northward , and other some , know that we be go westward , seek to meet with we again , as in truth there be about the number of 25 or 26 of they that meet with we in the space of four day again , and then we begin to reckon among our self , how many we be that be set on shore , and we find the number to be a hundred and fourteen , whereof two be drown in the sea , and eight be slay at the first encounter , so that there remain a hundred and four , of which 25 went westward with we , and 52 to the north with Hooper and Ingram : and as Ingram since have often tell i , there be not pass three of their company slay , and there be but six and twenty of they that come again to we , so that of the company that go northward , there be yet lack , and not certain hear of , the number of three and twenty man . and very i do think that there be of they yet alive , and marry in the say country , at Cibola , as hereafter i purpose ( God will ) to discourse of more particular , with the reason 412 and cause that make i so to think of they that be lack , which be David Ingram , twide , brown , and sundry other , who name we can not remember . And be thus meet again together , we travel on still westward , sometime through such thick wood , that we be enforce with cudgel to break away the bramble and bush from tear our naked body : other sometime we shall travel through the plain , in such high grass that we can scarce see one another , and as we pass in some place , we shall have of our man slay , and fall down sudden , be strike by the Indian , which stand behind tree and bush , in secret place , and so kill our man as they go by , for we go scatter in seek of fruit to relieve our self . we be also oftentimes great annoy with a kind of fly , which in the Indian tongue be call Tequani , and the Spaniard call they muskitos . there be also in the say country a number of other kind of fly , but none so noisome as these tequany be : you shall hardly see they they be so small , for they be scarce so big as a gnat ; they will suck one blood marvelous , and if you kill they while they be suck , they be so venomous that the place will swell extreme , even as one that be sting with a wasp or bee : but if you let they suck their fill , and to go away of themselves , than they do you no other hurt , but leave behind they a red spot somewhat big than a flea - bite . at the first we be terrible trouble with these kind of fly , not know their quality , and resistance we can make none against they , be naked : as for cold we fear not any , the country there be always so warm . and as we travel thus for the space of ten or twelve day , our captain do oftentimes cause certain to go up into the top of high tree , to see if they can descry any town or place of inhabitant , but they can not perceive any , and use often the same order to climb up into high tree , at the length they descry a 413 the english voyage great river that fall from the northwest into the main sea , and present after , we hear a harquebus shoot off , which do great encourage we , for thereby we know that we be near to some Christians , and do therefore hope short to find some succour and comfort , and within the space of one hour after , as we travel , we hear a cock crow , which be also no small joy unto we , and so we come to the north side of the river of Panuco , where the Spaniard have certain Salines , at which place it be that the harquebus be shoot off , which before we hear : to which place we go not direct , but miss thereof , we leave it about a bowshot upon our left hand : of this river we drink very greedy , for we have not meet with any water in six day before , and as we be here by the river side rest our self , and long to come to the place where the cock do crow , and where the harquebus be shoot off , we perceive many Spaniards upon the other side of the river , ride up and down on horseback , and they perceive we , do suppose that we have be of the Indian their border enemy , the Chichimeci : the river be not past half a bow shoot over : and present one of the Spaniard take a Indian boat call a Canoa , and so come over , be row by two Indian , and have take the view of we , do present row over back again to the Spaniard , who without any delay make out about the number of twenty horseman , and embark themselves in the canoas , they lead their horse by the reins swim over after they , and be come over to that side of the river where we be , they saddle their horse , and be mount upon they with their lance charge , they come very fierce run at we . our captain Anthony Godard see they come in that order , do persuade we to submit and yield our self unto they , for be naked , as we at this time be , and without weapon , we can not make any resistance , who bid we obey , and upon the yield of our self , they perceive we to be Christians , and do call for moor canoas , and carry we over by four 414 1568 . and four in a boat , and be come on the other side , they understand by our captain how long we have be without meat , impart between two and two a loaf of bread make of that country wheat , which the Spaniard call maiz , of the bigness of our halfpenny loaf , which bread be name in the Indian tongue clashacal . this bread be very sweet and pleasant unto we , for we have not eat any in a long time before : and what be it that hunger do not make to have a savoury and a delicate taste ? and have thus part the bread among we , those which be man they send afore to the town , have also many Indian inhabitant of that place to guard they : they which be young , as boy , and some such also as be feeble , they take up upon their horse , behind they , and so carry we to the town where they dwell , which be very near distant a mile from the place where we come over . this town be well situate , and well replenish with all kind of fruit , as orange , lemon , pomegranate , apricok , and peach , and sundry other , and be inhabit with a great number of tame Indian , or Mexicans , and have in it also at that time about the number of two hundred Spaniard , man , woman , and child , beside negro . of their Salines , which lie the Salines upon the west side of the river , more than a mile distant ° fpan ^ o - from thence , they make a great profit , for it be a excellent good merchandise there : the Indian do buy much thereof , and carry it up into the country , and there sell
