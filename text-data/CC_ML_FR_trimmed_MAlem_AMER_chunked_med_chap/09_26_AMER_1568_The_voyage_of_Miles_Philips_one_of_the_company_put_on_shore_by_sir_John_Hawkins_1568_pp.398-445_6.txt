in company with he two other small bark , and not past two hundred man in all , with who i go as interpreter in his own ship , which God know be but weak and ill appoint , so that for certain , if we have meet with captain drake , he may easy have take we all : we ix 433 2 e be embark keep our course and run southward towards Panama , keep still as nigh the shore as we can , and leave the land upon our left hand , and have coast thus for the space of eighteen or twenty day , and be moor to the south than Guatimala , we meet at last with other ship which come from Panama , of who we be certain inform that he be clean go off the coast more than a month before : and so we return back to Acapulco again , and there land , our captain be thereunto force , because his man be very sore seasick : all the while that i be at sea , with they , i be a glad man , for i hope that if we meet with master drake , we shall all be take , so that then i shall have be free out of that danger and misery wherein i live , and shall return to my own country of England again . but miss thereof , when i see there be no remedy but that we must needs come on land again , little do any man know the sorrow and grief that inward i feel , although outward i be constrain to make fair weather of it . and so be land , you next morrow after , we begin our journey towards Mexico , and past these town of name in Tuatepec , our way , as first the town of Tuatepec , 50 league from Washaca , te - Mexico , from thence to Washaca , 40 league from angle Mexico : from thence to Tepiaca 24 league from Mexico , Ztapelapa . ’ an from thence to Pueblo de los angel , where be a high hill which cast out fire three time a day , which hill be 18 league in manner direct west from Mexico , from thence we go to Stapelapa , 8 league from Mexico , and there our captain and most of his man take boat , and come to Mexico again , have be forth about the space of seven week or thereabouts . our captain make report to the viceroy what he have do , and how far he have travel , and that for certain he be inform that captain Drake be not to be hear of . to en ^ ro - which viceroy reply and say , sure we shall have phecudjmt he short come into our hand drive a land through false . necessity in some one place or other , for he be now in 434 these sea of Sur , it be not possible for he to get out of they again , so that if he perish not at sea , yet hunger will force he to land . and then again i be command by the viceroy that i shall not depart the city of Mexico , but always be at my master house in a readiness at a hour warning , when soever i shall be call : for that notwithstanding within one month after certain Spaniards go to Mecameca , 18 league from Mexico , to send away certain hide and Cochinilla , that they have there at their Stantias or dairy house , and my master have leave of the secretary for i to go with they , i take my journey with they be very well horse and appoint , and come thither and pass the time there at Mecameca certain day till we have perfect intelligence that the fleet be ready to depart , i not be past 3 day journey from the port of saint John de ullua , think it to be the meet time for i to make a escape , and i be the bold , presume upon my spanish tongue , which i speak as natural as any of they all , think with my self , that when i come to saint John de ullua , i will get to be entertain as a soldier , and so go home into Spain in the same fleet , and therefore secret one evening late , the moon shine fair , i convey my self away , and ride so for the space of two night and two day , sometime in , and sometime out , rest very little all that time , upon the second day at night i come to the town of Vera Cruz , we ™ Cruz distant from the port of saint John de ullua , where the d ^ ant \ bm ship ride , but only 5 league , and here purpose to rest s juand ™ my self a day or two , i be no soon alight , but Ullua . within the space of one half hour after , i be by ill hap arrest , and bring before justice there , be take and suspect to be a gentleman son of Mexico , that be run away from his father , who in truth be the [ three . 484 . ] man they seek for : so i be arrest , and bring before the justice , there be a great hurly burly about the matter , every man charge i that i be the son of such a man dwell in Mexico , which i flat deny , 435 affirm that i know not the man , yet will they not believe i , but urge still upon i that i be he that they seek for , and so i be convey away to prison . and as i be thus go to prison , to the further increase of my grief , it chance that at that very instant there be a poor man in the press that be come to town to sell hen , who tell the justice that they do i wrong , and that in truth he know very well that i be a Englishman and no Spaniard . they then demand of he how he know that , and threaten he that he say so , for that he be my companion , and seek to convey i away from my father , so that he also be threaten to be lay in prison with i : he for the discharge of himself stand stiff in it , that i be a Englishman , and one of captain Hawkins man , and that he have know i wear the saint Benito in the blackfriar at Mexico , for 3 or 4 whole year together : which when they hear , they forsake he , and begin to examine i a new , whether that speech of he be true , yea or no , which when they perceive that i can not deny , and perceive that i be run from Mexico , 8c come thither of purpose to convey my self away with the fleet , i be present commit to prison with a sorrowful heart , often wish my self that that man which know i have at that time be further off : howbeit he in sincerity have compassion of my distress estate , think by his speech , and know of i , to have set i free from that present danger which he see i in : howbeit , contrary to his expectation , i be thereby bring into my extreme danger , and to the hazard of my life , yet there be no remedy but patience perforce . and i be no soon bring into prison , but i have a great pair of bolt clap on my leg , and thus i remain in that prison for the space of 3 week , where be also many other prisoner which be thither commit for sundry crime , 8c condemn to the galley . during which time of imprisonment there , i find among those my prison - fellow some that have know i before in 436 Mexico , and true they have compassion of i , and will spare of their victual and any thing else that they have to do i good : among who there be one of they that tell i that he understand by a secret friend of he which often come to the prison to he , that i shall be short send back again to Mexico by wagon , so soon as the fleet be go from saint John de ullua , for Spain . this poor man my prison - fellow of himself , and without any request make by i , cause his say friend which come often unto he to the grate of the prison , to bring he wine and victual , to buy for he 2 knife which have file in their back , which file be so well make that they will serve and suffice any prisoner to file off his iron , and of those knife or file he bring one to i , and tell i that he have cause it to be make for i , and let i have it at that very price it cost he , which be 2 Pezos , the value of 8 . s . of our money : which knife when i have it , i be a joyful man , and convey the same into the foot of my boot , upon the inside of my left leg , and so within 3 or 4 day after that i have thus receive my knife , i be sudden call for , and bring before the head justice which cause those my iron with the round bolt to be strike off and send to a smith in the town , where be a new pair of bolt make ready for i of another fashion , which have a broad iron bar come between the shackle , and cause my hand to be make fast with a pair of manacle , and so be i present lay into a wagon all alone , which be there ready to depart with sundry other wagon , to the number of 60 . towards Mexico , and they all be lade with sundry merchandise which come in the fleet out of Spain . the wagon that i be in be foremost in all the company , and as we travel i be alone in the wagon , begin to try if i can pluck my hand out of the manacle , and as God will , although it be 437 mile fillip his last wonderful escape . [ HL 485 - ] the english voyage somewhat painful for i , yet my hand be so slender that 1 can pull they out , and put they in again , and ever as we go , when the wagon make most noise , and the man be busy , i will be work to file off my bolt , and travel thus for the space of 8 league from Vera Cruz , we come to a high hill , at the enter up of which ( as God will ) one of the wheel of the wagon wherein i be , break , so that by that mean the other wagon go afore , and the wagon - man that have charge of i set a Indian carpenter a work to mend the wheel : and here at this place they bait at a hostry that a negro - woman keep : and at this place , for that the go up of the hill be very steep , for the space of two league and better , they do always accustom to take the moile of 3 or 4 wagon , and to place they altogether for the draw up of one wagon , and so to come down again , and fetch up other in that order . all which come very well to pass : for as it draw towards night when most of the waggoner be go to draw up their wagon , in this sort i be alone have quick file off my bolt , and so espy my time in the dark of the evening before they return down the hill again , i convey my self into the wood there adjoin , carry my bolt and manacle with i , and a few biscuit , and two small cheese . And be come into the wood , i throw my iron into a thick bush , and then cover they with moss and other thing , and then shift for my self as i may all that night . and thus by the good providence of almighty God , i be free from my iron all save the collar that be about my neck , and so get my liberty the second time . 438 wherein be show how i escape to Guatimala , upon the south sea , and from thence to the port of Cavallos , where i get passage to go into Spain , and of our arrival at Havana , and our come to Spain , where i be again like to have be commit prisoner , and how through the great mercy of God i escape , and come home in safety into England in February 1582 . the next morning ( day light be come ) i perceive by the sun rise what way to take to escape their hand , for when i flee , i take the way into the wood upon the left hand : and have leave that way that go to Mexico upon my right hand , i think to keep my course as the wood and mountains lay , still direct south as near as i can : by mean whereof i be sure to convey my self far enough from that way that go to Mexico . and as i be thus go in the wood , i see many great fire make to the north not past a league from the mountain where i be , and travail thus in my boot with my iron collar about my neck , and my bread and cheese , the very same forenoon i meet with a company of Indian which be hunt of deer for
