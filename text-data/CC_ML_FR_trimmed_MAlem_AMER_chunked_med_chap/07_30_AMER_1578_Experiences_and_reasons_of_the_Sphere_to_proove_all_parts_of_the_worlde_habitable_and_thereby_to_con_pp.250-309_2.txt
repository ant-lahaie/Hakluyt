country , and a english woman his mother : whereby it seem this blackness proceed rather of some natural infection of that man , which be so strong , that neither the nature of the climb , neither the good complexion of the mother concur , can any thing alter , and therefore , we can impute it to the nature of the climb . and for a more fresh example , our people of Meta incognita ( of who and for who this discourse be take in hand ) that be bring this last year into England , be all general of the same colour that many nation be , lie in the midst of the middle zone . and this their colour be not only in the face which be subject to sun and air , but also in their body , which be still cover with garment as we be , yea the very suck child of twelve month age have his skin of the very same colour that most have under the equinoctial , which thing can proceed by reason of the climb , for that they be at least ten degree more towards the north than we in England be , no , the sun never come near their zenith by fourty degree : for in effect , they be within three or four degree of that which they call the freeze zone , and as i say , fourty degree from the burn zone , whereby it follow , that there be some other cause then the climate or the son perpendicular reflection , that shall cause the ethiopian great blackness . and the most probable cause to my judgement be , that this blackness proceed of some 262 natural infection of the first inhabitant of that country , and so all the whole progeny of they descend , be still pollute with the same blot of infection . therefore it shall not be far from our purpose , to examine the first originali of these black man , and how by a lineali descent they have hitherto continue thus black . it manifest and plain appear by holy scripture , the cause of that after the generail inundation and overflow of EthwPians the earth , there remain no more man alive but no â€˜ and his three son , Sem , cham , and Japhet , who only be leave to possess and inhabit the whole face of the earth : therefore all the sundry descent that until this present day have inhabit the whole earth , must needs come of the offspring either of Sem , cham , or Japhet , as the only son of Noe , who all three be white , and their wife also , by course of nature shall have beget and bring forth white child . but the envy of our great and continual enemy the wicked spirit be such , that as he can not suffer our old father Adam to live in the felicity and angellike state wherein he be first create , but tempt he , seek and procure his ruin and fall : so again , find at this flood none but a father and three son live , he so cause one of they to transgress and disobey his father commandment , that after he all his posterity shall be accurse . the fact of disobedience be this : when the ark of Noe at the commandment of God have make the ark and enter therein , and the floodgate of heaven be open , so that the whole face of the earth , every tree and mountain be cover with abundance of water , he straite command his son and their wife , that they shall with reverence and fear behold the justice and mighty power of God , and that during the time of the flood while they remain in the ark , they shall use continency , and abstain from carnail copulation with their wife : and many other precept he give unto they , and admonition touch the justice of God , in revenge sin , and his mercy in deliver they , 263 [ in . 53 . ] the english voyage who nothing deserve it . which good instruction and exhortation notwithstanding his wicked son I | be disobey , and be persuade that the first child bear after the flood ( by right and law of nature ) shall inherit and possess all the dominion of the earth , he contrary to his father commandment while they be yet in the ark , use company with his wife , and crafty go about thereby to disinherit the offspring of his other two brethren : for the which wicked and detestable fact , as a example for contempt of almighty God , and disobedience of parent , God will a son shall be bear who name be Chus , who not only it self , but all his posterity after he shall be so black and loathsome , that it may remain a spectacle of disobedience to all the world . and of this black and curse Chus come all these black moor which be in Africa , for after the water be vanish from off - the face of the earth , and that the land be dry , Sem choose that part of the land to inhabit in , which now be call Asia , and Japhet have that which now be call Europa , wherein we dwell , and Africa remain for cham and his black son Chus , and be call Chamesis after the father name , be perhaps a curse , dry , sandy , and unfruitful ground , fit for such a generation to inhabit in . thus you see , that the cause of the ethiopian blackness be the curse and natural infection of blood , and not the distemperature of the climate ; which also may be prove by this example , that these black man be find in all part of Africa , as well without the tropicke , as within , even unto Capo de buona Speranza southward , where , by reason of the sphere , shall be the same temperature that be in Sicilia , Morea and Candie , where all be of very good complexion . wherefore i conclude , that the blackness proceed not of the hotenesse of the climb , but as i say , of the infection of blood , and therefore this their argument gather of the african blackness be not able to destroy the temperature of the middle zone . we may therefore very well be ascertain , 264 that under the equinoctial be the most pleasant and delectable place of the world to dwell in ; where although the sun for two hour in a year be direct over their head , and therefore the heat at that time somewhat of force , yet because it come so seidome , and continue so small a time , when it come , it be not to be weigh , but rather the moderate heat of other great tem - time in all the year to be remember . and if the feature under heat at any time shall in the short day wax somewhat ^ umoc ~ urgent , the coldness of the long night there will easy refresh it , accord as Honterus say , speak of the temperature under the equinoctial . qu6dque die solis violento incanduit aestu , Humida nox reficit , paribusque refrigerat horis . if the heat of the sun in the day time do burn or parch any thing , the moisture of the night do cool and refresh the same again , the sun be as long absent in the night , as it be present in the day . also our author of the sphere , Johannes de Sacro Bosco , in the chapter of the zodiac , derive the etymologic of Zodiacus , of the greek word so , which in latin signify vita , life ; for out of Aristotle he allege , that secundum accessum and recessum solis in Zodiaco , fiunt generationes and corruptione in rebus inferioribus : accord to the sun go to and fro in the zodiac , the inferior body take their cause of generation and corruption . than it follow , that where there be most go too and fro , there be most generation and corruption : which must needs be between the two tropicke ; for there the sun go too and from most , and no where else but there . therefore between they under the two tropike , that be , in the middle zone , be great Equinoctiallis increase , multiplication , generation , and corruption of thing , which also we find by experience ; for there be it summer twice in the year , and twice winter , so that they have two harvest in the year , and continual spring . see then the middle zone fall out so 265 great heat under the tropics . the english voyage temperate , it rest to dedare where the hot part of the world shall be , for we find some place more hot than other . to answer this doubt , reason persuade , the ho test place in the world to be under and about the two tropicke ; for there more then in any other place do both the cause of heat concur , that be , the perpendicular fall of the sun beam , at right angle , and a great continuance of the sun above the horizon , the pole there be elevate three or four and twenty degree . and as before i conclude , that though the sun be perpendicular to they under the equinoctial , yet because the same continue but a small time , ( their day be short , and their night long ) and the speedy departure of the sun from their zenith , because of the sudden cross of the zodiac with the equinoctial , and that by such continual course and recourse of hot and cold , the temperature grow moderate , and very well able to be endure : so now to they under the two tropicke , the sun have once by his proper motion decline twenty degree from the equinoctial , begin to draw near their zenith , which may be ( as before ) about the eleven day of May , and then begin to send his beam almost at right angle , about which time the sun enter into the first degree of gemini , and with this almost right angle the sun beam will continue until it be past cancer , that be , the space of two month every day at noon , almost perpendicular over their head , be then the time of solstitium Aestivale : which so long continuance of the sun about their zenith may cause a extreme heat ( if any be in the world ) but of necessity far more heat than can be under the equinoctial , where the sun have not such long abode in the zenith , but pass away therehence very quick . also under the tropicke , the day be long by a hour and a half , than it be under the equinoctial ; wherefore the heat of the sun have a long time of operation , must needs be increase , 266 especial see the night wherein cold and moisture do abound under the tropicke , be less than it be under the equinoctial . therefore i gather , that under the tropicke be the hot place , not only of torrida zona , but of any other part of the world , especial because there both cause of heat do concur , that be , the perpendicular fall of the sun beam two month together , and the long abode of the sun presence above the Horison . and by this mean more at large be prove , that Marochus in summer be far more hot , then at any time under the equinoctial , because it be situate so near the Tropic of Cancer , and also for the length of their day . neither yet do i think , that the region situate under the Tropic be not habitable , for they be find to be very fruitful also ; although Marochus and some other part of Africa near the Tropike for the dryness of the native sandy soil , and [ three . 54 . ] some accident may seem to some to be intemperate for over much heat . for Ferdinandus Oviedus speak of Cuba and Hispaniola , hand of America , lie hard Cuba . under , or by the Tropike of Cancer , say , that these htspant Â° la - hands have as good pasture for cattle , as any other country in the world . also , they have most wholesome and clear water , and temperate air , by reason whereof the herd of beast be much big , fat , and of better taste , than any in Spain , because of the rank pasture , who moisture be better digest in the herb or grass , by continual ! and temperate heat of the sun , whereby be make more fat and unctious , it be of better and more steadfast nourishment : for continual and temperate heat do not only draw much moisture out of the earth to the nourishment of such thing as grow , and be engender in that climb , but do also by moderation preserve the same from putrify , digest also , and condensate or thicken the say moist nourishment into a gum and â–  unctious substance , whereby appear also , that under moderat ' tem the tropike be both wholesome , fruitful , and pleasant perature . 267 habitation , whereby last it follow , that all the middle zone , which until of late day have be count and call the burn , broil , and parch zone , be now find to be the most delicate , temperate , commodious , pleasant , and delectable part of the world , and especial under the equinoctial . have now
