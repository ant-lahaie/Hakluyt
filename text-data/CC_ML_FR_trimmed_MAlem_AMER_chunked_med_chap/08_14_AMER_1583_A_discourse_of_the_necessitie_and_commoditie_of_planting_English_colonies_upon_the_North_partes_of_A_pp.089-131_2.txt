and by strong hand pursue their enemy , subdue they , take possession of their town , city , or village , and ( in avoid murderous tyrannic ) to use the law of arm , as in like case among all nation at this day be use : and most especial to the end they may with security hold their lawful possession , lest happy after the departure of the christian , such savage as have be convert , shall afterward through compulsion and enforcement of their wicked ruler , return to their horrible idolatry ( as do the child of Israel , after the decease of Joshua ) and continue their wicked custom of most unnatural sacrifice of humane creature . and in so do , doubtless the Christians shall no whit at all transgress the bond of equity or civility , forasmuch as in former age , ( yea , before the incarnation of Christ ) the like have be do by sundry king and prince , governor of the child of Israel : chief in respect to begin their plant , for the establishment of God word : as also since the nativity of Christ , mighty and puissant emperor and king have perform the like , i say to plant , possess , and subdue . for proof whereof , i will allege you example of both kind . we read in the old testament , how that after Noes flood be cease , restauration of mankind begin only of those few of Noes child and family as be by God preelect to be save in the ark with he , who seed in process of time , be multiply to infinite number of nation , which in diverse sort divide themselves to sundry quarter of the earth . and forasmuch as all their posterity be mighty increase , follow not the perfect life of Noe their predecessor , God choose out of the multitude a peculiar people to himself , to who after - ioi ward be under the government of Moses in mount Sinai , he make a grant to inherit the land of Canaan , call the land of promise , with all the other rich and fertile country next adjoin thereunto . nevertheless , before they come to possession thereof , have be afflict with many grievous punishment and plague for their sin , they fall in despair to enjoy the same . but be encourage and comfort by their ruler , ( man of God ) they proceed , arm themselves with all patience , to suffer whatsoever it shall please God to send : and at last attain to the land , they be encounter with great number of strong people , and mighty king . Josua 4 . notwithstanding , Josua their leader replenish with the spirit of God , be assure of the justness of his quarrel , gather the chief strength of the child of Israel together , to the number of 40000 . with who he safe pass the huge river Jordan , and have before Josua 6 . scent privy spy for the discovery of the famous city Jerico , to understand the certainty of the citizen estate , he forthwith come thither , and environ it round about with his whole power the space of seven day . in which respite , perceive none of the gentile dispose to yield or call for mercy , he then command ( as God before have appoint ) that both the city Jerico shall be burn , yea , and all the inhabitant , as well old as young , with all their cattle shall be destroy , only except Rahab , her kindred and family , because she before have hide secret the messenger of Josua , that be send thither as spy . as for all their gold , silver , precious stone , or vessel of brass , they be reserve and consecrate to the lord treasury . Josua 8 . in like manner he burn the city hay , slay the inhabitant thereof , and hang up their king . but for so much as the gebionite ( fear the like event ) send Josua 9 ambassador unto Josua to entreat for grace , favour , and peace : he command that all their life shall be save , and that they shall be admit to the come - 102 pany of the child of Israel . yet understand afterward they wrought this by a policy , he use they as drudge to hew wood and to carry water , and other necessary for his people . thus begin this valiant captain his conquest , which he pursue and never leave [ three . 171 . ] till he have subdue all the Hethites , Amorites , Cananite , Judg . 11 . 13 . Peresites , h evite , and Jebusites , with all their prince and king , be thirty and one in number , and diverse other strange nation , beside who land and dominion he whole divide among God people . after that Josua be decease , Juda be constitute lord over the army , who receive like charge from God , pursue the proceed of the holy captain Josua , and utter vanquish many gentile , idolater , and adversary to the child of Israel , with all such ruler or king as withstand he , and namely Adonibezek the Judg . 1 . most cruel tyrant : who thumb and great toe he cause to be cut off , for so much as he have do the like before unto seventie king , who be his prisoner , he force to gather up their victual underneath his table . in this God show his justice to revenge tyrannic . we read likewise , that Gideon a most puissant and noble warrior so behave himself in follow the worthy act of Josua and Juda , that in short time he not only deliver the child of Israel from the hand of the multitude of the fierce madianite , but also subdue they and their tyrant , who land he cause God people to possess and inherit . i can recite diverse other place out of the scripture , which apt may be apply hereunto , be it not i do endeavour my self by all mean to be brief . now in like manner will i allege some few induction out of the authentical write of the ecclesiastical historiographer , all tend to the like argument . and first to begin withal , we do read : that after our saviour Jesus Christ have suffer his passion , the apostle be inspire with the holy ghost , and the knowledge of all strange language , do immediate disperse themselves to 103 a gpodnotefinal conqueror to be mercifiull . Judg . 6 . 7 . ad . the english voyage 1583 - sundry part of the world , to the preach of the gospel . yet not in so general a manner , but that there remain some far remote country unvisited by they , among the which it be report that India the great , call the uttermost India , as yet have receive no light of the word . ruffinuslib . i . but it come to pass , that one Metrodorus a very learned ca ? ' 9 - and wise philosopher in that age , be desirous to search out unknown land , do first discover the same , find it wonderful populous and rich , which upon his return be publish , and for certain understand , there be another grave philosopher of Tyrus call Meropius , be a christian , who do resolve himself ( follow the example of Metrodorus ) to travail thither , and in a short time assist but with a few , in a small vessel arrive there , have in his company two young youth , Edesius and Frumentius , who ( be his scholar ) he have thorough instruct both in liberali science , and christian religion . now after that Meropius somewhile stay there , have ( as he think ) sufficient understanding of the Indian whole estate : he determine to depart , and to bring notice thereof unto the emperor , who he mean to exhort to the conquest of the same . but by misfortune he be prevent , for be in the midst of his course on the sea homeward , a sore tempest arise , and perforce drive he back again , to a unknown port of the say land : where he by the Meropius most cruel barbarous Indian on the sudden be slay slay . with all his company , except the two young scholar aforesay , who the barbarous Indian , by reason they be of comely stature and beautiful personage , take , Edesius and and forthwith present they to their king and queen : frumentius which both be very well like of , the king courteous entreat , and ordain Edesius to be his butler , and the Indian . „ : , . „ ... r ’ - Frumentius his becretarie , and in rue year by reason or their learning and civil government , they be have in great favour , honour , and estimation with the prince . but the king depart this life , leave the queen his 104 wife with her young son to govern , and give free scope and liberty to the two Christians , at their best pleasure to pass to their native soil , allow they all necessary for the same . yet the queen who high favour they be very sorrowful they shall depart , and therefore most earnest entreat they to tarry and assist she in the government of her people , till such time as her young son grow to ripe year , which request they fulfil . and Frumentius excel Edesius far in all wisdom , rule both the queen and her subject at his discretion , whereby he take occasion to put in practise privy , that the foundation of christian religion may be plant in the heart of such as with who he think his persuasion may best prevail , and that soon will give ear unto he : which be bring to pass accord , he then with his fellow Edesius take leave of the queen to return to his native country . and so soon as he be arrive there , he reveal to the emperor Constantine , the effect of all those event : who both commend his deed and whole allow thereof , by the advice and good like of Athanasius then bishop of Alexandria , do arm and set forth a convenient power for the aid of Frumentius , in this his so godly a purpose . and by this mean come the emperor afterward by fair promise , and by force of histone , testi - arme together , unto the possession of all the Indian fi how that country . the author of this story Ruffinus receive c ° nstantl ™ the truth hereof from the very mouth of Edesius come - eniarge his panion to Frumentius . dominion by moreover Eusebius in his historic ecclesiastical ! in subdue of infidel and idolatrous nation .
