the east , and spend the rest they return . of the time in discover the river towards the sea , which we have not view , and which be most materiali . the next day follow we leave the mouth of Caroli , and arrive again at the port of morequito where we be before : for pass down the stream we go without labour , and against the wind , little less than a hundred mile a day . assoon as i come to anchor , i send away one for old Topiawari , with who i much desire to have further conference , and also to deal with he for some one of his country , to bring with we into England , as well to learn the language , as to confer withal by the way , the time be now spend of any long stay there . within three hour after my messenger come to he , he arrive also , and with he such a rabble of all sort of people , and every one load with somewhat , as if it have be a great market or fair in England : and our hungry company cluster thick and threefold among their basket , every one lay hand on 409 1595 - the last conference of sir Walter Ralegh with Topiawari . who son he bring into England . counsel to be follow in other conquest . Macureguarai the first town of Guiana , and of rich and apparel people . the english voyage what he like . after he have rest a while in my tent , i shut out all but our self , and my interpreter , and tell he that i know that both the Epuremei and the Spaniard be enemy to he , his country and nation : that the one have conquer Guiana already , and the other seek to regain the same from they both : and therefore i desire he to instruct i what he can , both of the passage into the golden part of Guiana , and to the civil town and apparel people of Inga . he give i a answer to this effect : first that he can not perceive that i mean to go onward towards the city of Manoa , for neither the time of the year serve , neither can he perceive any sufficient number for such a enterprise : and if i do , i be sure with all my company to be bury there , for the emperor be of that strength , as that many time so many man more be too few : beside he give i this good counsel and advise i to hold it in mind ( as for himself he know , he can not live till my return ) that i shall not offer by any mean hereafter to invade the strong part of Guiana without the help of all those nation which be also their enemy : for that it be impossible without those , either to be conduct , to be victual , or to have aught carry with we , our people not be able to endure the march in so great heat , and travel , unless the borderer give they help , to carry with they both their meat and furniture : for he remember that in the plain of Macureguarai three hundred Spaniard be overthrow , who be tire out , and have none of the borderer to their friend : but meet their enemy as they pass the frontier , be environ on all side , and the people set the long dry grass on fire , smother they , so as they have no breath to fight , nor can discern their enemy for the great smoke . he tell i far that 4 day journey from his town be Macureguarai , and that those be the next and near of the subject of Inga , and of the 410 Epuremei , and the first town of apparel and rich people , and that all those plate of gold which be scatter among the borderer and carry to other nation far and near , come from the say Macureguarai and be there make , but that those of the land within be far fine , and be fashion after the image of man , beast , bird , and fish . i ask he whether he think that those company that i have there with i , be sufficient to take that town or no ? he tell i that he think they be . i then ask he , whether he will assist i with guide , and some company of his people to joy ne with we ? he answer that he will go himself with all the borderer , if the river do remain fordable , upon this condition that i will leave with he till my return again fifty soldier , which he undertake to victuali : i answer that i have not above fifty good man in all there , the rest be labourer and rower , and that i have not pro - . vision to leave with they of powder , shot , apparel , or [ three . 655 . ] aught else , and that without those thing necessary for their defence , they shall be in danger of the Spaniard in my absence , who i know will use the same measure towards i , that i offer they at Trinidad : and although upon the motion captain Calfield , captain green vile , my nephew John Gilbert and diverse other be desirous to stay , yet i be resolve that they must needs have perish , for Berreo expect daily a supply out of Spain , and look also hourly for his son to come down from Nuevo reyno de Granada , with many horse and foot , and have also in Valencia in the Caracas , two hundred horse ready to march , and i can not have spare above forty , and have not any store at all of powder , lead , or match to have leave with they , nor any other provision , either spade , pickeaxe , or ought else to have fortify withal . when i have give he reason that i can not at this time leave he such a company , he then desire i to forbear he and his country for that time , for he 411 assure i that i shall be no soon three day from the coast , but those Epuremei will invade he , and destroy all the remain of his people and friend , if he shall any way either guide we or assist we against they . he further allege , that the Spaniard seek his death , and as they have already murder his nephew morequito lord of that province , so they have he seventeen day in a chain before he be king of the country , and lead he like a dog from place to place , until he have pay a hundred plate of gold , and diverse chain of spleen - stone for his ransom : and now since he become owner of that province , that they have many time lay wait to take he , and that they will be now more vehement , when they shall understand of his conference with the english , and because , say he , they will the better displant i , if they can lay hand on i , they have get a nephew of i call Eparacano , who they have christen don Juan , and his son don Pedro , who they have also apparel and arm , by who they seek to make a party against i in my own country : he also have take to wife one Loviana of a strong family , which be borderer and neighbour , and my self now be old and in the hand of death be not able to travel nor to shift , as when i be of young year : he therefore pray we to defer it till the next year , when he will undertake to draw in all the borderer to serve we , and then also it will be more seasonable to travel , for at this time of the year , we shall not be able to pass any river , the water be and will be so grow ere our return . he far tell i , that i can not desire so much to invade Macureguari , and the rest of Guiana , but that the borderer will be more vehement than i , for he yield for a chief cause that in the war with the Epuremei , they be spoil of their woman , and that their wife and daughter be take from they , so as for their own part they desire nothing of the gold 412 or treasure , for their labour , but only to recover woman from the Epuremei : for he far complain very sad ( as it have be a matter of great consequence ) that whereas they be wont to have ten or twelve wife , they be now enforce to content themselves with three or four , and that the lord of the Epuremei have fifty or a hundred : and in truth they war more for woman then either for gold or dominion : for the lord of country desire many child of their own body , to increase their race and kindred , for in those consist their great trust and strength . diverse of his follower afterward desire i to make haste again , that they may sack the Epuremei , and i ask they of what ? they answer , of their woman for we , and their gold for you : for the hope of those many of woman they moor desire the war , then either for gold , or for the recovery of their ancient territory . for what between the subject of Inga , and the Spaniard , those frontier be grow thin of people , and also great number be flee to other nation far off for fear of the Spaniard . after i receive this answer of the old man , we fall into consideration , whether it have be of better advice to have enter Macureguarai , and to have begin a war upon Inga at this time , yea or no , if the time of the year , and all thing else have sort . for my own part ( as we be not able to march it for the river , neither have any such strength as be requisite , and dare not abide the come of the winter , or to tarry any long from our ship ) i think it be evil counsel to have attempt it at that time , although the desire of gold will answer many objection : but it will have be in my opinion a utter overthrow to the enterprise , if the same shall be hereafter by her majesty attempt : for than ( whereas now they have hear we be enemy to the Spaniard and be send by her majesty to relieve they ) they will as good cheap have join with the Spaniard at our 413 15951 , , , return , as to have yield unto we , when they have prove that we come both for one errant , and that both seek but to sack and spoil they , but as yet [ three . 656 . ] our desire of gold , or our purpose of invasion be not know to they of the empire : and it be likely that if her majesty undertake the enterprise , they will rather submit themselves to her obedience then to the Spaniard , of who cruelty both themselves and the borderer have already taste : and therefore till i have know her majesty pleasure , i will rather have lose the sack of one or two town ( although they may have be very profitable ) then to have deface or endanger the future hope of so many million , and the great good , and rich trade which England may be possess of thereby . i be assure now that they will all die even to the last man against the Spaniard in hope of our succour and return : whereas otherwise if i have either lay hand on the borderer , or ransom the lord , as Berreo do , or invade the subject of Inga , i know all have be lose for hereafter . after that i have resolve Topiawari lord of Aromaia , that i can not at this time leave with he the company he desire , and that i be content to forbear the enterprise against the Epuremei till the next year , he free give i his only son to take with i into England , and hope , that though he himself have but a short time to live , yet that by our mean his son shall be establish after his death : and i leave with he one Francis Francis sparrow , a servant of captain Gifford , ( who be sparrow . desirous to tarry , and can describe a country with his pen ) and a boy of i call Hugh Goodwin , to learn the language . i after ask the manner how the Epuremei wrought those plate of gold , and how they can melt it out of the stone ; he tell i that the most of the gold which they make in plate and image , the lake off be not sever from the stone , but that on the lake of Manoa . Manoa , and in a multitude of other river they gather it in grain of perfect gold and in piece as big as small 414 stone , and
