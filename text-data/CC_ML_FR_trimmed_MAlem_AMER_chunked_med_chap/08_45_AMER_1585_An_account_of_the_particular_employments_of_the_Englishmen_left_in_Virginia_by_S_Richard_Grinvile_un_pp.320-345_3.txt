truth as they be more valiant people and in great number than the rest , so be they more faithful in their promise , and since my late be there have give many token of earnest desire they have to join in perfect league with we , and therefore be great offend with Pemisapan and weopomeiok for make he believe such tale of we . the three cause of this go to Dasamonquepeio be to dispatch his messenger to weopomeiok , and to the mandoage as aforesaid : all which he do with great impress of copper in hand , make large promise to they of great spoil . the answer within few day after come from weopomeiok , which be divide into two part . first for the king Okisko , who deny to be of the party for himself , or any of his especial follower , and therefore do immediate retire himself with his force into the main : the other be concern the rest of the say province who accept of it : and in like sort the mandoag receive the impress . the day of their assembly aforesaid at Roanoak be appoint the 10 . of June : all which the premise be discover by Skyco , the king Menatonon his son my 339 prisoner , who have once attempt to run away , i lay he in the bylboe , threaten to cut off his head , who i remit at Pemisapan request : whereupon he be persuade that he be our enemy to the death , he do not only feed he with himself , but also make he acquaint with all his practise . on the other side , the young man find himself as well use at my hand , as i have mean to show , and that all my company make much of he , he flat discover all unto i , which also afterward be reveal unto i by one of Pemisapan own man , that night before he be slay . Theise mischief be all instant upon i and my company to be put in execution , it stand i in hand to study how to prevent they , and also to save all other , which be at that time as aforesaid so far from i : whereupon i send to Pemisapan to put suspicion out of his head , that 1 mean present to go to croatoan , for that i have hear of the arrival of our fleet , ( though i in truth have neither herd nor hope for so good adventure , ) and that i mean to come by he , to borrow of his man to fish for my company , and to hunt for i at croatoan , as also to buy some four day provision to serve for my voyage . he send i word that he will himself come over to Roanoak , but from day to day he defer , only to bring the weopomeiok with he and the mandoag , who time appoint be within eight day after . it be the last of May 1586 when all his own savage begin to make their assembly at Roanoak , at his commandment send abroad unto they , and i resolve not to stay long upon his come over , since he mean to come with so good company , but think good to go and visit he with such as i have , which i resolve to do the next day : but that night i mean by the way to give they in the island a canvisado , and at the instant to seize upon all the canoas about the island , to keep he from advertisement . but the town take the alarm before i mean it to 340 they : the occasion be this . i have send the master of the light horseman , with a few with he , to gather up all the canoas in the set of the sun , and to take as many as be go from we to Dasamonquepeio , but to suffer any that come from thence , to land . he meet with a Canoa go from the shore , and overthrow the Canoa , and cut off slaughter two Savages head : this be not do so secret but he be discover from the shore ; whereupon the cry arise : for in truth they , privy to their own villainous purpose against we , hold as good espial upon we , both day and night , as we do upon they . the alarm give , they take themselves to their bow , and we to our arm : some three or four of they at the first be slay with our shot : the rest flee into the wood . the next morning with the light horseman and one Canoa take 25 with the colonel of the chesepians , and the sergeant major , i go to Dasamonquepeio : and be land , send Pemisapan word by one of his own savage that meet i at the shore , that i be go to croatoan , and mean to take he in the way to complain unto he of Osocon , who the night pass be convey away my prisoner , who i have there present tie in a handlocke . hereupon the king do abide my come to he , and find my self amid seven or eight of he principali weroance and follower , ( not regard any of the common sort ) i give the watchword agree upon , ( which be , Christ our victory ) and immediate those his chief man and himself have by the mercy of God for our deliverance , that which they have purpose for we . the king himself be shoot through by the colonel with a pistol , lie on the ground for dead , and i look as watchful for the save of Manteos friend , as other be busy that none of the rest shall escape , sudden he start up , and run away as though he have not be touch , insomuch as he overrun all the company , be by the way shoot thwart the buttock by my irish boy with my petronel . in the end a 341 irish man serve i , one Nugent , and the deputy provost , undertake he ; and follow he in the wood , overtake he : and i in some doubt lest we have lose both the king and my man by our own negligence to have be intercept by the savage , we meet he Pemisapan return out of the wood with Pemisapan head in slay - he hand .. This fall out the first of June 1586 , and the eight of the same come advertisement to i from captain Stafford , lie at my lord admiral island , that he have discover a great fleet of three and twenty sail : but whether they be friend or foe , he can not yet discern . he advise i to stand upon as good guard as i can . the nine of the say month he himself come unto i , have that night before , and that same day travel by land twenty mile : and i must true report of he from the first to the last ; he be the gentleman that never spare labour or peril either by land or water , fair weather or foul , to perform any service commit unto he . a letter from he bring i a letter from the general sir Francis sir Francis Drake , with a most bountiful and honourable offer for â€™ the supply of our necessity to the performance of the action we be enter into ; and that not only of victual , munition , and clothe , but also of bark , pinnaces , and boat ; they also by he to be victual , man , and furnish to my contentation . the ten day he arrive in the road of our bad harbour : and come there to a anchor , the eleven day i come to he , who i find in deed most honourable to perform that which in writing and message he have most courteous offer , he have aforehand propound the matter to all the captain of his fleet , and get their like and consent thereto . with such thank unto he and his captain for his care both of we and of our action , not as the matter deserve , but as i can both for my company and my 342 ' self , i ( be aforehand prepare what i will desire ) crave at his hand that it will please he to take with he into England a number of weak and unfit man for my good action , which i will deliver to he ; and in place of they to supply i of his company with oare - man , artificer , and other . that he will leave we so much ship and victuali , as about August then next follow will carry i and all my company into England , when we have discover somewhat , that for lack of needful provision in time leave with we as yet remain undo . that it will please he withal to leave some sufficient master not only to carry we into England , when time shall be , but also to search the coast for some better harbour , if there be any , and especial to help we to some small boat and oare - man . also for a supply of caliver , hand weapon , match and lead , tool , apparel , and such like . he have receive these my request , accord to his usual commendable manner of government ( as it be tell i ) call his captain to counsel ; the resolution be that i shall send such of my officer of my company as i use in such matter , with their note , to go aboard with he ; which be the master of the victual , the keeper of the store , and the vicetreasurer : to who he appoint forthwith for i the Francis , be a very proper bark of 70 tun , and take present order for bring of victual aboard she for 100 man for four month , with all my other demand whatsoever , to the uttermost . and further , he appoint for i two pinnace , and four small boat : and that which be to perform all his former liberality towards we , be that he have get the full assent of two of as sufficient experiment master as be any in his fleet , by judgement of they that know they , with very sufficient ging to tarry with i , and to employ themselves most earnest in the action , as i shall appoint they , until the term which 343 [ three . 264 . . ] i promise of our return into England again . the name of one of those master be Abraham Kendal , the other Griffith Herne . while these thing be in hand , the provision aforesaid be bring , and in bring aboard , my say master be also go aboard , my say bark have accept of their charge , and my own officer , with other in like sort of my company with they ( all which be dispatch by the say general the 12 of the say month ) the 13 of the same there arise such a unwonted storm , and continue four day , that have like to have drive all on shore , if the lord have not hold his holy hand over they , and the general very provident foresee the worst himself , then about my dispatch put himself aboard : but in the end have drive sundry of the fleet to put to sea the Francis also with all my provision , my two master , and my company aboard , she be see to be free from the same , and to put clear to sea this storm have continue from the 13 to the 16 of the month , and thus my bark put away as aforesaid , the general come ashore make a new proffer unto i ; which be a ship of 170 ton , call the bark Bonner , with a sufficient master and guide to tarry with i the time appoint , and victual sufficient to carry i and my company into England , with all provision as before : but he tell i that he will not for any thing undertake to have she bring into our harbour , and therefore he be to leave she in the road , and to leave the care of the rest unto my self , and advise i to consider with my company of our case , and to deliver present unto he in write what i will require he to do for we : which be within his power , he do assure i aswell for his captain as for himself , shall be most willing perform . Heereupbn call such captain and gentleman of my company as then be at hand , who be all as privy as my self to the general offer : their whole re - 344 quest be to i , that consider the case that we stand in , the weakness of our company , the small number of the same , the carry away of our first appoint bark , with those two especial master , with our principali provision in the same , by the very hand of God as it seem , stretch out to take we from thence ; consider also , that his second offer , though most honourable of his part , yet of we not to be take , insomuch as there be no possibility for she with any safety to be bring into the harbour : see furthermore , our hope for supply with sir Richard Greenvill , so undoubted promise we before easter , not yet come , neither then likely to come this year , consider the do in England for Flanders , and also for America , that therefore i will resolve my self with my company to go into England in that fleet , and accord to make request to the general in all our name , that he will be please to give we present passage with he . which request of we by my self deliver unto he , he most ready assent unto : and so he send immediately his pinnace unto our island for the fetch away of a few that there be leave with our baggage , the weather be so boisterous , and the pinnace so often on ground , that the most of all we have , with all our card , book and write be by the sailor cast overboard , the great number of the fleet be much aggrieve with their long and dangerous abode in that miserable road . ' from whence the general in the name of the almighty , weigh his anchor ( have bestow we among his fleet ) for the relief of who he have in that storm sustain more peril of wrack then in all his former most honourable action against the Spaniard , with praise unto God for all , set sail the nineteenth of June 1586 , and arrive in Portsmouth the seven and twenty of July â€™ the same year .
