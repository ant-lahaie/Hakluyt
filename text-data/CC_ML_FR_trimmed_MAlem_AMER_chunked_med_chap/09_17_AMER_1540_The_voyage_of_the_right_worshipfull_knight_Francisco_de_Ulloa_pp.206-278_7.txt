a garland make of parats feather , or sparrow feather paint red ; they lay down also certain plume of white feather , and other of blue colour . in the mean while we see continual Indian assemble to the shore by ten and ten , and so by little and little they come in squadron ; 245 and one of they assoon as he see the boat begin to leap forward and backward with so great nimbleness , that doubtless he seem to all of we a man of great agility , and we take no small pleasure while we behold he fetch those gambol : but the rest of the Indian which stand at the mouth of the fresh water run towards he , and cry unto he , forbid he to use those gesture , because we be come thither in peaceable sort , and by this mean he come with the rest to the water place , where by little and little in this manner there assemble above a hundred of they all in order , with certain staff with cord to fling they , and with their bow and arrow , and they be all paint . in the mean while our chichimeco - interpreter bear in the he of California , be come unto we , and the captain again command a mariner to strip himself , and to swim and lay upon the say rock certain bell , and more bead , and when he have lay they there , the Indian make sign that he shall go away ; and so they come thither and take they , and our man draw near with their boat . the captain command the Indian our chichimeco to speak unto they , but they can not understand he , so that we assure believe , that they understand not the language of the he of California . this day be Tuesday until night the Indian stay at this water place , take some of our bead , and give unto we their feather and other thing , and when it be very late they depart . the morrow follow be Wednesday very early the captain command that our buttes shall be make ready , that before break of day , and before the Indian shall take the hill , which stand over the water place , we may be land in good order : which be put in execution : for we go on shore with as many as can go , save those that have charge to take in the water , and such as be to stay on shipboard , which in all be about fourteen or fifteen person , in as good order as we can devise : for we be four crossbow , two 246 ... I539 ' harquebusier , and eight or nine target , and the most part of we carry very good sling , and every one eighteen river stone , which weapon the captain invent , because the Indian at the first have handle we very shrewd with the multitude of stone which they fling at we : we have nothing to defend we save our target , and to seek to win the fort from whence they endamage we ; he therefore think with these sling , that we may offend they , and we likewise think well of his opinion , for make trial of they , we throw very well with they , and much far than we think we can have do : for the sling be make of hemp , we fling very far with they . now be come to the water place the say Wednesday by break of day we take the fort of the fountain , which be certain crag or rock hang over the same , between which there be a open or deep valley through which this water run , which be no great quantity , but a little brook not past a fathom broad . So stand all in order , other four or five Indian come thither , who as soon as they see we to be come on shore , and to have get the top of the water place , [ three . 413 . ] they retire unto a small hill on the other side , for the valley be between they and we : neither stay they long before they begin to assemble themselves as they have do the day before by 10 and 10 , and 15 and 15 , range themselves on this high hill , where they make sign unto we . and Francis Preciado crave licence of the general to parley with these Indian , and to give they some trifle ; wherewith he be content , charge he not to come too near they , nor to go into any place where they may hurt he . whereupon Francis go unto a plain place , under the hill where the Indian stand , and to put they out of fear he lay down his sword and target , have only a dagger hang down at his girdle , and in a scarf which he carry at his neck , certain bead to exchange with they , comb , fishinghook and comfit . and he begin to go up the hill , and 247 truck wonderful traffic with the Indian fir mother ofpearle , and other thing . the english voyage to show they diverse of his merchandise . the Indian as soon as he have lay those thing on the ground , and go somewhat aside , come down from the hill and take they , and carry they up , for it seem that their lord be among they , to who they carry those trifle . than they come down again , and lay to give unto he in the say place , a oyster of pearl , and two feather like hawk feather , make sign to Preciado that he shall come and take they ; which he do , and again lay there a string of bell , and a great fishhook , and certain bead ; and they take the same , lay there again another oyster of pearl , and certain feather : and he lay down other bead , two fishhook , and more comfit , and the Indian come to take they up , and approach much near unto he , then at other time , and so near that a man may have touch they with a pike , and then they begin to talk together : and 7 or 8 moor come down , unto who Francis Preciado make sign , that they shall come down no low , and they incontinent lay their bow and arrow on the ground , and have lay they down come somewhat low , and there with sign , together with they which come first , they begin to parley with he , and require mariner breech and apparel of he , and above all thing a red hat please they high , which the say Francis wear on his head , and they pray he to reach it unto they , or to lay it in the place ; and after this certain of they make sign unto he to know whether he will have a harlot , signify with their finger those villainy and dishonest action , and among the rest they set before he a Indian of great stature die whole with black , with certain shell of the mother of pearl at his neck , and on his head , and speak by sign to Francis Preciado touch the foresay act of fornication , thrust their finger through a hole , they say unto he , that if he will have a woman , they will bring he one ; and he answer , that he like well of it , and that therefore they shall bring he one . in the mean space 248 on the other side where the general stand with his company , another squadron of Indian show themselves , whereupon the general and his company make a stir , and put themselves in battle array : whereupon Francis Preciado be enforce to come down from they , to joy ne with the general and his company : and here the Indian which come last begin to make sign that we shall lay down something to truck , and that they will give we some of their shell of mother of pearl , which they bring upon certain small stick , and herewithal they come very near unto we , wherewith we be not well content . and Francis Preciado say unto the captain , that if it please he , he will cause all the Indian to come together and to stay upon that high hill ; and he answer , that it be best to draw they all together , for by this time our man have take in all their water , and stay for the boat : whereupon Francis take a crown of bead go towards the valley , through which the water run towards the Indian , and . make sign unto they to call the rest , and to come all together , because he will go to the old place , to lay thing on the ground for exchange , as at the first ; and they answer that he shall do so , and that they have call the other , and that they will do , as he will have they , and so they do , for they cause they to come unto they , which they do , and Francis likewise go alone towards they , in which mean space the general command his people to get into the boat . Francis come unto the place begin to lay down his merchandise of traffic , and afterward make sign unto they to stay there , because he will go to the ship to bring they other thing , and so he return to the place where the captain be , and find they all get into the boat , save the general and three or four other , and the general make as though he have give other trifle to Preciado to carry unto the Indian , and when he be go a little from he , he call he back again , and all this while the 249 Indian stand still , and be come unto he , we go fair and soft to our boat , and get into they at our ease , without any throng , and thence we come aboard our ship . the Indian see we thus go aboard come down to the strand where the brook of water be , and call unto we to come forth with our boat , and to come on shore , and to bring our bead , and that they will give we of their mother of pearl : but we be now set at [ three . 4 . 14 . ] dinner make no account of they : whereupon they begin to shoot arrow at the ship , and although they fall near we , yet they do not reach we . in the mean season certain mariner go out in the boat , to weigh the anchor , whereupon the Indian see they come towards they , 8c bring they nothing , they begin in scorn to show they their buttock , make sign that they shall kiss their bum : and these seem to be those that come last . the general see this , command a musket to be once or twice shoot off , and that they shall take their just aim . they see these shot to be make ready , some of they rise and go to shoot their arrow at our mariner , which be go to weigh the anchor , than the general command the great ordinance speedy to be shoot off , whereupon three or four bullet be discharge , and we perceive that we have slay one of they , for we assure see he lie dead upon the shore ; and i think some of the rest be wound . they hear this noise , and see he dead run away as fast as ever they can , some along the shore , and some through the valley , drag the dead Indian with they , after which time none of they appear , save ten or twelve , which peep up with their head among those rock ; whereupon another piece of ordinance be discharge aloft against the place where they be , after which time we never see any more of they . 250 at the point of the Trinity they spend three day in fish , and in other pastime : after which set sail they discover pleasant country , and mountain void of grass , and a hand afterward call Isla de los cedros , or the he of cedar , near which they suffer sharp cold and rain , and to save themselves they return thither . immediate we set sail to join with the ship Santa Agueda , which be above half a league in the high sea from we , and this be on the Wednesday the seventeenth of December . be come together because the wind be contrary , we draw near to a headland , which we call Punta de la Trinidad , and here we stay fish , and solace our self two or three day , although we have always great store of rain . afterwards we begin to sail very slow , and
