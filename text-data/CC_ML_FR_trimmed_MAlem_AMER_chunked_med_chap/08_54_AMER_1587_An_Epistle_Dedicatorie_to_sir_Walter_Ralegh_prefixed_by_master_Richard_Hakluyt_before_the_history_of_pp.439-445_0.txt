Richard Hakluyt . to the right honourable sir Walter Ralegh knight , captain of her majesty guard , lord warden of the stannery , and her highness lieutenant generail of the county of cornwall , R . H . wish true felicity . ir , after that this history , which have be conceal many year , be late commit to print and publish in France under your name by my learned friend m . Martine Basanier of Paris , i be easy induce to turn it into english , understand that the same be no less grateful to you here , than i know it to be acceptable to many great and worthy person there . and no marvel though it be very welcome unto you , and that you like of the translation thereof , since no history hitherto set forth have more affinity , resemblance or conformity with you of Virginia , than this of Florida . but call to mind that you have spend more year in France than i , and understand the french better then my self , i forthwith perceive that you approve mine endeavour , not for any private ease or commodity that thereby may redound unto you , 439 other man misfortune ought to be our warning . the chief thing worthy observation in Florida be draw in colour by James morgue painter sometime live in the black friar in London . the english voyage but that it argue a singular and especial care you have of those which be to be employ in your own like enterprise , who , by the read of this my translation , you will have forewarn and admonish aswell to beware of the gross negligence in provide of sufficiency of victual , the security , disorder , and mutiny that fall out among the french , with the great inconvenience that thereupon ensue , that by other mishap they may learn to prevent and avoid the like , as also may be put in mind , by the read of the manifold commodity and great fertility of the place herein at large describe and so near neighbour unto our colony , that they may general be awake and stir up unto the diligent observation of every thing that may turn to the advancement of the action , whereinto they be so cheerful enter . many speciali point concern the commodity of these part , the accident of the french man government therein , the cause of their good or bad success , with the occasion of the abandon one of their fort , and the surprise of the other by the enemy be herein true and faithful record : which because they be quote by i in the margin , and reduce into a large alphabetical ! table , which i have annex to the end of the work , it shall be needless to reckon up again . and that the rather , because the same with diverse other thing of chief importance be lively draw in colour at your no small charge by the skilful painter James morgue , sometime live in the Blackfriar in London ( who Monsieur chastillion than admiral of France send thither with Laudonniere for that purpose ) which be a eyewitness of the goodness and fertility of those region , and have put down in write many singularity which be not mention in this treatise : which since he have publish together with the purtraiture . Theise four voyage i know not to who i may better offer then to your self , and that for diverse just consideration . first , for that as i have say before , they be dedicate 44 ® unto you in french : second because now four time also you have attempt the like upon the self same coast near adjoin : three in that you have pierce as far up into the main and discover no less secret in the part of your abode , than the french do in the place of their inhabit last consider you be now also ready ( upon the late return of captain Stafford and good news which he bring you of the safe arrival of your last colony in their wish haven ) to prosecute this action more thorough than ever . and here to speak somewhat of this your enterprise , i affirm , that if the same may speedy and effectual be pursue , it will prove far more beneficial in diverse respect unto this our realm , than the world , yea many of the wise sort , have hitherto imagine . the particular commodity whereof be well collection of know unto your self and some few other , and be faithful and with great judgement commit to writing , i it as you be not ignorant , by one of your follower , which remain there about a twelvemonth with your worshipful lieutenant m . Ralph lane , in the diligent search of the secret of those country . touch the speedy and effectual pursue of your action , though i wot well it will demand a prince purse to have it thorough follow without linger , yet be i of opinion , that you shall draw the same before it be long to be profitable and gainful aswell to those of our nation there remain , as to the merchant of England that shall trade hereafter thither , partly by certain secret commodity already discover by your servant , and partly by breed of diverse sort of beast in those large and ample region , and plant of such thing in that warm climate as will best prosper there , and our realm stand most in need of . and this i find to have be the course that both the Spaniard and Portugal take in the beginning of their discovery and conquest . for the Spaniard at their first entrance into Hispaniola find neither sugar - cane nor ginger grow there , nor any kind of our cattle : but 441 mean to raise benefit in newdiscovery use by the Spaniard in Portugal . A . D . the english voyage . I587 - .. kine , sugar - find the place fit for pasture they send cow and bull and cane and sundry sort of other profitable beast thither , and trans -^ rted ^ nto ' port the plant of sugar - cane , and set the root of Hispaniola ginger : the hide of which ox , with sugar and ginger , and Madera , be now the chief merchandise of that island . The and c - Portugal also at their first foot in Madera , as John Barros write in his first decade , find nothing there but mighty wood for timber , whereupon they call the island by that name . howbeit the climate be favourable , they enrich it by their own industry with the best wine and sugar in the world . the like manner of Wtad and proceed they use in the isle of the azore by sow therein great quantity of woad . So deal they in saint ' Thomas under the equinoctial , and in Brasil , and sundry other place . and if our man will follow their step , by your wise direction i doubt not but in due time they shall reap no less commodi tie and benefit . Moreover there be none other likelihood but that her majesty , which have christen , and give the name to your Virginia , if need require , will deal after the manner of honourable godmother , which , see their gossip not full able to bring up their child themselves , be wont to contribute to their honest education , the rather if they find any towardliness or reasonable hope of goodness in they . Elizabeth queen of Castille and Aragon , after her ^ bethqueene ' husband Ferdinando and she have empty their coffer and of Castille and exhaust their treasure in subdue the kingdom of Aragon in Granada and root the moor , a wicked weed , out of advance of Spain , be nevertheless so zealous of God honour , " din ^ to ™ 5 ( as Fernand we Columbus the son of Christopher God glory . Columbus record in the history of the deed of his father ) she lay part of her own jewel , which she have in great account , to gage , to furnish his father forth upon his first voyage , before any foot of land of all the west Indies be discover ; what may we expect of our most magnificent and gracious prince Elizabeth of England , into who lap the lord have most plentiful throw his treasure , what may we , i say , hope of she forward - 442 ness and bounty in advance of this your most honourable enterprise , be far more certain than that of Columbus , at that time especial , and tend no less to the glory of God then that action of the Spaniard ? for as you may read in the very last word of the relation of new Mexico extant now in english , the main land , where your last colony mean to seat themselves , be replenish with many thousand of Indian , which be of better wit than those of Mexico and theaptnesse Peru , as have be find by those that have have some trial ! or they : whereby it may be gather that they ofVirgmiato will easy embrace the gospel , forsake their idolatry , embrace wherein at this present for the most part they be wrap christiamtie . and entangle . a wise philosopher note the sundry Seneca . desire of diverse man , write , that if a ox be put into a meadow he will seek to fill his belly with grass , if a stork be cast in she will seek for snake , if you turn in a hound he will seek to start a hare : so sundry man enter into these discovery propose unto themselves several end . some seek authority and place of commandment , other experience by see of the world , the most part worldly and transitory gain , and that often time by dishonest and unlawful mean , the few number the glory of God and the save of the soul of the poor and blind infidel . yet because diverse honest and well dispose person be enter already into this your business , and that i know you mean hereafter to send some such good churchman thither , as may true say with the apostle to the savage , we z . Cor . 12 . 14 . seek not you but you : i conceive great comfort of the success of this your action , hope that the lord , who power be wont to be perfect in weakness , will bless the feeble foundation of your build . only be you Josue 1 . 6 . of a valiant courage and faint not , as the lord say unto Josue , exhort he to proceed on forward in the conquest of the land of promise , and remember that private man have happy wield and wade through as great enterprise as this , with lesser mean than those which 443 God in his mercy have bountiful bestow upon you , [ three . 303 . ] to the singular good , as i assure my self , of this our common wealth wherein you live . hereof we have the god sue - example domestical and foreign . Remember i pray c * ssej y ° u > what you find in the begin of the chronicle stra ^ ow rd the conquest of Ireland new dedicate unto your earleofchep - self . read you not that Richard Strangbow the decay stow . earl of Chepstow in Monmuthshire , be in no great favour of his sovereign , pass over into that island in the year 1171 . and accompany only with certain of his private friend have in short space such prosperous success , that he open the way for king Henry the second to the speedy subjection of all that warlike nation to this crown of England ? the like conquest of Brasilia , and annex the same to the kingdom of Portugal be first begin by mean and private man , as don Antonio de Castillio , ambassador here for that realm , and by office keeper of all the record and monument of their discovery , assure i in this city in the year 1581 . now if the greatness of the main of Virginia , and the large extension thereof , especial to the west , shall make you think that the subdue of it , be a matter of more difficulty than the conquest of Ireland , first i answer , that as the late experience of that skilful ! the happy late pilot and captain m . John Davis to the northwest discoverieto ( towards which his discovery your self have thrice Captaine ^ contribute with the forward ) have show a great part Davis . to be main sea , where before be think to be main land , so for my part i be full persuade by Ortelius late reformation of culvacan and the gulf of California , that the land on the back part of Virginia extend nothing so far westward as be put down in the map of those part . Moreover it be not to be deny , but that one hundred man will do more now among the naked and unarm people in Virginia , than one thousand be able then to do in Ireland against that arm and warlike nation in those day . i say further , that these two year last experience have plain show , that we may spare 444 10000 able man without any miss . and these be as many as the kingdom of Portugal have ever in all their garrison of the azore , Madera , Arguin , Cape verde , Guinea , Brasill , Mozambique , melinde , Zocotora , ormus , diu , goa , Malaca , the Malucos , and Macao upon the coast of China . yea this i say by the confession of singular expert man of their own nation ( who name i suppress for certain cause ) which have be personal in the east Indies , and have assure i that their king the hinge of have never above ten thousand natural bear Portugal ( their slave except ) out of their kingdom remain ten thousand of in all the aforesaid territory . which also this present their natural year i see confirm in a secret extract of the particular subject in all estate of that kingdom and of every government and office subject to the same , with the several pension there - ^ ons ' unto belong . see therefore we be so far from want of people , that retire daily home out of the low country they go idle up and down in swarm for lack of honest entertainment , i see no fit place to employ some part of the better sort of they train up thus long in service , then in the inward part of the firm of Virginia against such stubborn savage as shall refuse obedience to her majesty . and doubtless many of our man will be glad and fain to accept this condition , when as by the read of this present treaty they shall understand the fertility and riches of the region confine so near upon you , the great commodity and goodness whereof you have be content to suffer to come to light . in the mean season i humble commend my self and this my translation unto you , and your self , and all those which under you have take this enterprise in hand to the grace and good blessing of the almighty , which be able to build far , and to finish the good work which in these our day he have begin by your most christian and charitable endeavour . from London the 1 . of May 1587 . your lord humble at commandment .
