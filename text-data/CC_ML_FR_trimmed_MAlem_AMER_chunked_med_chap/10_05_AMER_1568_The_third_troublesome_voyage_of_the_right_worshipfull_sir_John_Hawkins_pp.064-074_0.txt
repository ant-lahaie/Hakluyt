the three troublesome voyage make with the Jesus of Lubeck , the minion , and four other ship , to the part of Guinea , and the west Indies , in the year 1567 and 1568 by m . John Hawkins . a storm . the fleet be he ship depart from Plymouth , the second day of October , anno 1567 and have reasonable weather until the seven day , at which time forty league north from cape Finister , there arise a extreme storm , which continue four day , in such sort , that disperse , and all our great boat lose , Gomera . envenom arrow . and the Jesus our chief ship , in such case , as not think able to serve the voyage : whereupon in the same storm we set our course homeward , determine to give over the voyage : but the eleven day of the same month , the wind change with fair weather , whereby we be animate to foil owe our enterprise , and so do , direct our course with the hand of the canary , where accord to a order before prescribe , all our ship before disperse , meet at one of those hand , call Gomera , where we take water , and depart from thence the four day of November , towards the coast of Guinea , and arrive at cape Verde , the eighteenth of November : where we land 150 man , hope to obtain some negro , where we get but few , and those with great hurt and damage to our man , which chief proceed of their envenom arrow : and although in the beginning they seem to be but small hurt , yet there hardly escape any that have blood draw of they , but die in strange sort , with their mouth shut some ten day before they die , and after their wound be whole ; where i my self have one of the great 64 1567 . wound , yet thanks be to God , escape . from thence we pass the time upon the coast of Guinea , search with all diligence the river from Rio Grande , unto Sierra Leona , till the twelve of Januarie , in which time we have not get together a hundred and fifty negro : yet notwithstanding the sickness of our man , and the late time of the year come - [ three . 522 . ] mand we away : and thus have nothing wherewith to seek the coast of the west India , i be with the rest of our company in consultation to go to the coast of the mine , hope there to have obtain some gold for our ware , and thereby to have defray our charge . but even in that present instant , there come to we a negro , send from a king , oppress by other king his neighbour , desire our aid , with promise that as many negro as by these war may be obtain , aswell of his part as of we , shall be at our pleasure : whereupon we conclude to give aid , and send 120 of our man , which the 15 of Januarie , assault a town of the negro of our town of ally adversary , which have in it 8000 inhabitant , 8 °°° ” * 8 ™ be very strong impale and fence after their ' manner , but it be so well defend , that our man prevail not , but lose six man and forty hurt : so that our man send forthwith to i for more help : whereupon consider that the good success of this enterprise may high further the commodity of our voyage , i go my self , and with the help of the king of our side , assault the town , both by land and sea , and very hardly with fire ( their house be cover with dry palm leave ) obtain the town , put the inhabitant to flight , where we take 250 person , man , woman , and child , and by our friend the king of our side , there be take 600 prisoner , whereof we hope to have have our choice : but the negro ( in which nation be seidome or never find 5 in truth ) mean nothing less : for that night he re - negro . move his camp and prisoner , so that we be ten 65 e the english voyage fain to content we with those few which we have get our self . now have we obtain between four and five hundred negro , wherewith we think it somewhat reasonable to seek the coast of the west Indies , and there , for our negro , and other our merchandise , we hope to obtain , whereof to countervail our charge with some gain , whereunto we proceed with all diligence , furnish our water , take fuel , and depart the coast of Guinea the three of February , continue at the sea with a passage more hard , then before have be accustom till the 27 day of march , which day we have sight of a hand , call Dominica , upon the coast of the west Indies , in fourteen degree : from thence we coast from place to place , make our traifike with the Spaniards as we may , somewhat hardly , because the king have straight command all his governor in those part , by no mean to suffer any trade to be make with we : notwithstanding we have reasonable trade , and courteous entertainment , from the he of Margarita unto Cartagena , without any thing great worth the note , save at Capo de la Vela , in a town call Rio de la Hacha ( from whence come all the pearl ) the treasurer who have the charge there , will by no mean agree to any trade , or suffer we to take water , he have fortify his town with diverse bulwark in all place where it may be enter , and furnish himself with a hundred harquebusier , so that he think by famine to have enforce we to have put a land our negro : of which purpose he have not great fail , unless we have by force enter the town : which ( after we can by no mean obtain his favour ) we be enforce to do , and so with two hundred man break in upon their bulwark , and enter the town with the loss only of two man of our part , and no hurt do to the Spaniard because after their volley of shot discharge , they all flee . thus have the town with some circumstance , as 66 partly by the Spaniard desire of negro , and partly by friendship of the treasurer , we obtain a secret trade : whereupon the Spaniard resort to we by night , and buy of we to the number of 200 negro : in all other place where we trade the Spaniard inhabitant be glad of we and trade willing . at Cartagena the last town we think to have Cartagena . see on the coast , we can by no mean obtain to deal with any Spaniard , the governor be so straight , and because our trade be so near finish we think not good either to adventure any land , or to detract further time , but in peace depart from thence the 24 of July , hope to have escape the time of their storm which then soon after begin to reign , the which they call Furicanos , but pass by the west Furicanos . end of Cuba , towards the coast of Florida there happen to we the 12 day of August a extreme storm which continue by the space of four day , which so beat the Jesus , that we cut down all her high building , her rudder also be sore shake , and withal be in so extreme a leak that we be rather upon the point to leave she then to keep she any long , yet hope to bring all to good pass , we seek the coast of Florida , where we find no place nor haven for our ship , because of the shalownesse of the coast : thus be in great despair , and take with a new storm storm . which continue other 3 day , we be enforce to take for our succour the port which serve the city of Mexico call saint John de ullua , which stand in 19 degree : in seek of which port we take in our way 3 ship which carry passenger to the number of a hundred , which passenger we hope shall be a mean to we the better to obtain victual for our money , Sc a quiet place for the repair of our fleet . Shortly after this the 16 of September we enter the [ i3j - 523d port of saint John de ullua and in our entry the ° a Spaniard think we to be the fleet of Spain , the chief officer of the country come aboard we , which the Spaniard be deceive of their expectation be great disdeceived . may : but immediate when they see our demand be nothing but victual , be recomfort . i find also in the same port twelve ship which have in they by report two hundred thousand pound in gold and silver , all which ( be in my possession , with the king hand as also the passenger before in my way thitherward stay ) i set at liberty , without the take from they the weight of a groat : only because i will not be delay of my dispatch , i stay two man of estimation and send post immediate to Mexico , which be two hundred mile from we , to the president and Councell there , show they of our arrival there by the force of weather , and the necessity of the repair of our Oure request , ship and victual , which want we require as friend to king Philip to be furnish of for our money : and that the president and Councell there shall with all convenient speed take order , that at the arrival of the spanish fleet , which be daily look for , there may not cause of quarrel rise between we and they , but for the better maintenance of amity , their commandment might be have in that behalf . this message be send away the sixteenth day of September at night , be the very day of our arrival , in the next morning which be the seventeenth day of the same month , we see open of the haven thirteen great ship , the fleet of and understand they to be the fleet of Spain , i Spain . send immediate to advertise the general of the fleet of my be there , do he to understand , that before i will suffer they to enter the port , there shall some order of condition pass between we for our safe be there , and maintenance of peace . now it be to the manner be understand that this port be make by a little hand stone not three foot above the water in the high one ua . piace , a ( j but a bow - shoot of length any way , this hand stand from the main land two bow shoot or more , also it be to be understand that there be not in all this coast any other place for ship to arrive in safety , 68 because the north wind have there such violence , that unless the ship be very safe more with their anchor fasten upon this hand , there be no remedy for these north wind but death : also the place of north wind the haven be so little , that of necessity the ship must ride one aboard the other , so that we can not give place to they , nor they to we : and here i begin to bewail that which after follow , for now , say i , i be in two danger , and force to receive the one of they . that be , either i must have keep out the fleet from enter the port , the which with god help i be very well able to do , or else suffer they to enter in with their accustom treason , which they never fade to execute , where they may have opportunity , to compass it by any mean : if i have keep they out , then have there be present shipwreck of all the fleet which amount in value to six million , which be in value of our money 1800000 . livre . which i consider i8ooz & w * w i be not able to answer , fear the queen majesty poundindignation in so weighty a matter . thus with my self revolve the doubt , i think rather better to abide the jutt of the uncertainty , than the certain tie . the uncertain doubt i account be their treason which by good policy i hope may be prevent , and therefore as choose the least mischief i proceed to condition . now be our first messenger come and return from the fleet with report of
