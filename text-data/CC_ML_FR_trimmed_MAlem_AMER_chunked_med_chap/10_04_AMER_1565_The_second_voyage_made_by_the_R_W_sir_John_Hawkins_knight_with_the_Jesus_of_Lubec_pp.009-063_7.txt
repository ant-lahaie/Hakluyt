, ten or twelve day work , and what it will have be long he know not , and ( that which be worst ) he have not above a day water and therefore know not what shift to make : but in fine , because the want be such , that his man can not live with it , he determine to seek water , and to go further to leeward , to a place ( as it be set in the card ) call Rio de los puercos , which he be in doubt of , both whether it be inhabit , and whether there be water or not , and whether for the shoald he may have such access with his ship , that he may convenient take in the same . and while we be in these trouble , and keep our way to the place aforesaid , almighty God our guide ( who will not suffer 47 we to run into any further danger , which we have be like to have incur , if we have range the coast of Florida along as we do before , which be so dangerous ( by report ) that no ship escape which come thither , ( as the Spaniard have very well prove the same ) send we the eight day at night a fair westerly wind , whereupon the captain and company consult , determine not to refuse God gift , but every man be content to pinch his own belly , whatsoever have happen ; and take the say wind , the nine day of July get to the table , and sail the same night , unaware overshoot Havana ; at which place we think to have water : but the next day , not know that we have overshoot the same , sail along the coast , seek it , and the eleven day in the morning , by certain know mark , we understand that we have overshoot it 20 league : in which coast range , we find no convenient water place , whereby there be no remedy but to disemboque , and to water upon the coast of Florida : for , to go further to the eastward , we can not for the shoald , which be very dangerous ; and because the current shoot to the north - east , we doubt by the force thereof to be set upon they , and therefore dare not approach they : so make but reasonable way the day aforesaid , and all the night , the twelve day in the morning we fall with the island upon the cape of Florida , which we can scant double by the mean that fear the shoald to the eastwards , the state of and doubt the current come out of the west , the current of which be not of that force we make account of ; for 011 of our feel little or none till our fell with the cape , and then feel such a current , that bear all sail against the same , yet be drive back again a great pace : the experience whereof we have by the Jesus pinnace , and the Salomons boat , which be send the same day in the afternoon , while the ship be becalm , to see if they can find any water upon the island aforesaid ; who spend a great part of the day in row thither , be further offend than they deem it to be , and in the mean time a fair gale of wind spring at sea , the ship depart , make a sign to they to come away , who although they see they depart , because they be so near the shore , will not lose all the labour they have take , but determine to keep their way , and see if there be any water to be have , make no account but to find the ship well enough : but they spend so much time in fill the water which they have find , that the night be come before they can make a end . and have lose the sight of the ship , they row what they can , but be whole ignorant which way they shall seek they again ; as indeed there be a more doubt than they know of : for when they depart , the ship be in no current ; and sail but a mile further , they find one so strong , that bear all sail , it can not prevail against the same , but be drive back : whereupon the captain send the Salomon , with the other two bark , to bear near the shore all night , because the current be less there a great deal , and to bear light , with shoot off a piece now and then , to the intent the boat may better know how to come to they . the Jesus also bear a light in her top gallant , and shoot off a piece also now and then , but the night pass , and the morning be come , be the thirteenth day , and no news can be hear of they , but the ship and bark cease not to look still for they , yet they think it be all in vain , by the mean they hear not of they all the night past ; and therefore determine to tarry no long , seek for they till noon , and if they hear no news , than they will depart to the Jesus , who perforce ( by the vehemency of the current ) be carry almost out of sight ; but as God will have it , now time be come , and they have tack about in the pinnace top , have sight of they , and take they up : they in the boat , be to the number of one and twenty , have sight of the ship , ten 49 d [ three . 516 . ] and see they tack about ; whereas before at the first sight of they they do great rejoice , be now in a great perplexity than ever they be : for by this they think themselves utter forsake , whereas before they be in some hope to have find they . Truly God wrought marvellous for they , for they themselves have no victual but water , and be sore oppress with hunger , be not of opinion to bestow any further time in seek the ship then that present noon time ; so that if they have not at that instant espy they , they have go to the shore to have make provision for victual , and with such thing as they can have get , either to have go for that part of Florida where the french man be plant ( which will have be very hard for they to have do , because they want victual to bring they thither , be a hundred and twenty league off7 ) or else to have remain among the floridians ; at who hand they be put in comfort by a french man , who be with they , that have remain in Florida at the first find thereof , a whole year together , to receive victual sufficient , and gentle entertainment , if need be , for a year or two , until which time God may have provide for they . but how contrary this will have fall out to their expectation , it be hard to judge , see those people of the cape of Florida be off more savage and fierce nature , and more valiant than any of the rest ; which the Spaniard well prove , who be five hundred man , who intend there to land , return few or none of they , but be enforce to forsake the same : and of their cruelty mention be make in the book of the decade , of a friar , who take upon he to persuade the people to subjection , be by they take , and his skin cruel pull over his ear , and his flesh eat . in these island they be a shore , find a dead man , dry in a manner whole , with other head and body of man : so that these sort of man be eater of the flesh of man , aswell as the cannibal . but to return to our purpose . the fourteen day the ship and bark come to the Jesus , bring they news of the recovery of the man , which be not a little to the rejoice of the captain , and the whole company : and so then altogether they keep on their way along the coast of Florida , and the fifteen day come to a anchor , and so from six and twenty degree to thirty degree and a half , where the french man abide , range all the coast along , seek for fresh water , anker every night , because we will overshoot no place of fresh water , and in the day time the captain in the ship pinnace sail along the shore , go into every creek , speak with diverse of the floridians , because he will understand where the french man inhabit ; and not find they in eight and twenty degree , as it be declare unto he , marvel thereat , and never leave sail along the coast till he find they , who inhabit in a river , by they call the river of May , and stand in thirty degree and better . in range this coast along , the captain find it to be all a island , and therefore it be all low land , and very scant of fresh water , but the country be marvellous sweet , with both marsh and meadow ground , and goodly wood among . there they find sorel to grow as abundant as grass , and where their house be , great store of maiz and mill , and grape of great bigness , but of taste much like our english grape . also deer great plenty , which come upon the sand before they . their house be not many together , for in one house a hundred of they do lodge ; they be make much like a great barne , and in strength not inferior to we , for they have stanchion and rafter of whole tree , and be cover with palmito - leaves , have no place divide , but one small room for their king and queen . in the midst of this house be a hearth , where they make great fire all night , and they sleep upon certain piece of wood m .
