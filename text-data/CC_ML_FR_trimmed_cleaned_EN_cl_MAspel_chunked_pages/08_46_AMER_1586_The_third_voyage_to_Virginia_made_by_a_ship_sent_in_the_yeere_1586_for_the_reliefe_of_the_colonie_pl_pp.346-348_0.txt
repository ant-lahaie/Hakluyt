The third voyage made by a ship sent in the year 1586 , to the relief of the Colony planted in Virginia , at the sole charges of Sir Walter Ralegh . N the year of our Lord 1586 Sir Walter Ralegh at his own charge prepared a ship of and hundred tun , freighted with all manner of things in most plentiful manner , for the supply and relief of his Colony then remaining in Virginia : but before they set sail from England it was after Easter , so that our Colony half despaired of the coming of any supply : wherefore every man prepared for himself , determining resolutely to spend the residue of their life time in that country . And for the better performance of this their determination , they sowed , planted , and set such things as were necessary for their relief in so plentiful a manner as might have sufficed them two years without any further labour . Thus trusting to their own harvest , they passed the Summer till the tenth of June : at which time their corn which they had sowed was within one fortnight of reaping : but then it happened that Sir Francis Drake in his prosperous return from the sacking of Sant Domingo , Cartagena , and Saint Augustine , determined in his way homeward to visit his countrymen the English Colony then remaining in Virginia . So passing along the coasts of Florida , he fell with the parts where our English Colony inhabited : and having espied some of that company , there he anchored and went aland , where he conferred with them of their state and welfare , and how things had passed with them . They answered him that they lived all ; but hitherto in some scarcity : and as yet could hear of no supply out of England : therefore they requested him that he would leave with them some two or three ships , that if in some reasonable time they herd not out of 346 England , they might then return themselves . Which he agreed to . Whilst some were then writing their letters to send into England , and some others making reports of the accidents of their travels each to other , some on land , some on board , a great storm arose , and drove the most of their fleet from their anchors to Sea , in which ships at that instant were the chiefest of the English Colony :
