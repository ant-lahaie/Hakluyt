, we departed from thence , bound two 8c two together , and guarded as before , and so travailed on our way towards Mexico , till we came to a town within forty leagues of Mexico , nam Mestitlan , where is a house of black friars : and in this town there are about the number of three hundred Spaniards , both men , women , and children . ix 417 2D [ HIM . 477 - 1 The friars sent us meat from the house ready dressed , and the friars , and the men and women used us very courteously , and gave us some shirts and other such things as we lacked . Here our men were very sick of their agues , and with eating of another fruit called in the Indian tongue , Guiaccos , which fruit did bind us so soar , that for the space of tenne or twelve days we could not ease our selves . The next morning we departed from thence with our two Spaniards and Indian guard , as aforesaid . Of these two Spaniards the one was and aged man , who all the way did very courteously entreat us , and would carefully go before to provide for us both meat and things necessary to the uttermost of his power : the other was a young man who all the way traveled with us , and never departed from us , who was a very cruel caitiff , and he carried a javelin in his hand , and sometime when as our men with very feebleness and faintness were not able to go so fast as he required them , he would take his javelin in both his hands , and strike them with the same between the neck and the shoulders so violently , that he would strike them down ; then would he cry , and say , Marchad , marchad Ingleses perros , Luterianos , enemigos de Dios : which is as much to say in English , as March , march on you English dogs , Lutherans , enemies to God .
