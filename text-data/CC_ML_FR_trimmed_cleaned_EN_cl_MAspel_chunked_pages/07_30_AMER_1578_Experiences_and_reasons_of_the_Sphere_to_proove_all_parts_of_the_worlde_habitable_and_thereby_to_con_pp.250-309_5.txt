going over their heads in the Zodiac , I thought good here to allege such natural causes as to me seem very substantiali and sure reasons . First you are to understand that the Sun doth work his more or less heat in these lower parts by two means , the one is by the kind of Angle that the Sun beams do make with the earth , as in all Torrida Zona it makes perpendicularly right Angles in some place or other at noon , and towards the two Poles very oblique and uneven Angles . And the other mean is the longer or shorter continuance of the Sun above the Horizon . So that wheresoever these two causes do most concur , there is most excess of heat : and when the one is wanting , the rigor of the heat is less . For though the Sun beams do beatrice perpendicularly upon any region subject unto it , if it hath no continuance or abided above the Horizon , to work his operation in , there can no hight effect proceed . For nothing can be done in a moment . And this second cause mora Solis supra Horizontem , the time of the suns abiding above the Horizon , the old Philosophers never remembered , but regarded only the manner of Angles that the Sun beams made with the Horizon , which if they were equal and right , the heat was the greater , as in Torrida Zona : if they were unequal and oblique , the heat was the less , as towards both Poles , which reason is very good and substantiali : for the perpendicular beams reflect and reverberate in themselves , so that the heat is doubled , every beam striking twice , & by uniting are multiplied , and continue strong in form of a Column . But in our Latitude of 50 . and 60 . degrees , the Sun beams descend oblique and slanting wise , and so strike but once and depart , and therefore our 255 Heat is caused by two means that is by his manner of
