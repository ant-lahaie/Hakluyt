continue so lying for the space of 74 . years after ; being a dismal sign of future calamity unto mankind . For all things should come to pass within those 74 . years , which , as our Saviour Christ foretold unto his disciples , were to be fulfilled about the end of the world ; namely that nation should rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and that there should be in many places earthquakes , pestilence , and famine , terrible apparitions in the heavens , and great signs , together with alterations of kingdoms , wars of infidels against the Christians , and victories of the Christians against the infidels . And as they wondered at these relations , he declared unto them the passion of the seven Sleepers , with the proportion and shape of each of their bodies ( which things no man living had as then committed unto writing ) and that so plainly and distinctly , as if he had conversed a long time in their company . Hereupon the earl sent a knight , the bishop a clerk , and the abbot a monk unto Maniches the Emperor of Constantinople , with the letters and gifts of their King . Who giving them 286 friendly entertainment , sent them over unto the bishop of Ephesus ; and wrote his letters unto him giving him charge , that the English Ambassadors might be admitted to see the true , and material habiliments of the seven Sleepers . And it came to pass that King Edwards vision was approved by all the Greeks , who protested they were advertised by their father ' s , that the foresaid seven Sleepers had always before that time rested upon their right sides ; but after the Englishmen were entered into the cave , those Sleepers confirmed the truth of the outlandish prophesy , unto their countrymen . Neither were the calamities foretold , any long time delayed : for the Agarens , Arabians , Turkes and other unbelieving nations invading the Christians , harried and spoiled Syria , Lycia , the lesser Asia , and many cities of Asia the greater , and among the rest Ephesus , yea , and Jerusalem also .
