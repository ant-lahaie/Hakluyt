OF hunger and thirst , cold and weariness , there was no end . For they gave us no victuals , but only in the evening . In the morning they used to give us a little drink , or some sodden Millet to sup off . In the evening they bestowed flesh upon us , as namely , a shoulder and breast of rams mutton , and every man a measured quantity of broth to drink . When we had sufficient of the flesh - broth , we were marvellously well refreshed . And it seemed to me most pleasant , and most nourishing drink . Every Saterday I remained fasting until night , without eating or drinking of ought . And when night came , I was constrained , to my great grief and sorrow , to eat flesh . Sometime we were feign to eat flesh half sodden , or almost raw , and all for want of fuel to seethe it withal : especially when we lay in the fields , or were 280 1253 - benighted before we came at our journeis end : because we could not then conveniently gather together the dung of horses or oxen : for other fuel we found but seidome , except perhaps a few thorns in some places .
