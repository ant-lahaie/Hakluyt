The true report of the siege and taking of Famagusta , of the antique writers called Tamassus , a city in Cyprus 1571 . In the which the whole order of all the skirmishes , batteries , mines , and assaults given to the said fortress , may plainly appear . Englished out of Italian by William Malim . To the right honourable and his singular good Lord , and only Patron the Earl of Leicester , Baron of Denbigh , Knight of the honourable order of the Garter , one of the Queens Majesties most honourable privy Council etc . William Malim wishes long health with increase of honour . TO hath be a natural instinct ( right honourable and mine especial good lord ) ingraffed in noble personages hearts , much approved and confirmed also by custom , for them to seek from time to time , by some means in their life , by the which they after their death might deliver over their name to their posterity : lest otherwise with their body , their fame also altogether might perchance be buried . Upon the which consideration we read many notable and famous things to have be erected in time past of noble personages ( having had wealth at will ) in such sort , that not only certain ruins of the same sumptuous works built so many hundred years past , do still remain , but also the most part of those princes , the authors of them , do continually by them dwell in our memories . As the Pyramids made at Memphis , or near the famous river of Nilus , by the great expenses of the kings of Egypt : the tower called Pharia , made in the Hand of Pharos by king Ptolomee : the walls of Babylon , made or at the least reedified by 118 queen Semiramis : Dianas church at Ephesus built by all the noble persons of Asia : Mausolus tomb or sepulchre , made by his wife queen of Caria : Colossus Solis placed at Rhodes , I remember not by what Princes charge , but made by the hands of Cares Lindius
