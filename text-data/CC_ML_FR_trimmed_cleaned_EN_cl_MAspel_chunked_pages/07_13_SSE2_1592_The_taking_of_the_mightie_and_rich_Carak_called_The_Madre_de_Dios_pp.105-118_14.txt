The cargazon being taken out , and the goods freighted in tenne of our ships sent for London , to the end that the bigness , heighth , length , breadth , and other dimensions of so huge a vessel might by the exact rules of Geometricali observations be truly taken , both for present knowledge , and derivation also of the same unto posterity , one M .

After and exquisite survey of the whole frame he found the length from the beakhead to the stern ( whereupon was erected a lantern ) to contain 165 foot . The breadth in the second close deck whereof [ II ii . 199 . ] she had three , this being the place where there was most extension of breadth , was 46 foot and 10 inches . She drew in water 31 foot at her departure from Cochin in India , but not above 26 at her arrival in Dartmouth , being lightened in her voyage by diverse means , some 5 foot . She carried in height 7 several stories , one main Orlop , three close decks , one forecastle , and a spar - deck of two floors a piece .
