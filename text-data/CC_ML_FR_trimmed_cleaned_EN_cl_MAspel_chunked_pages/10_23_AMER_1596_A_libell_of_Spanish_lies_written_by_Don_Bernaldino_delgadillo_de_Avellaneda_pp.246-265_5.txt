, nor to shoot off one harquebus or piece of artillery , for they fled away as fast as they could , and their ships were half diminished , and that the best part of them : the rest they repaired in Puerto Bello , whereas they were about fortie days , and so by that means they were all well repaired ; and our ships were very foul , because the time would not permit us to trim them : I have sailed 2 months and a half in the Admiral , since we departed from Cartagena , we have not repaired their pumps nor cleansed them : and the same day I departed thence , there came unto me a small Pinnace in the like distress : our Viceadmiral and the rest of our ships have the like impediment , but no great hindrance unto us , for ought I could perceive by our enemies : It is manifest what advantage they had of us , and by no means was it possible for us to take them , unless we could have come to have found them at and anchor . Nevertheless they left us one good ship behind for 251 our share , well manned , which told me that Drake died in Number de Dios , and that they have made for general of the English fleet the Colonel Quebraran : and also by means of the small time , being straightly followed by us , they had no opportunity to take either water , wood or flesh , and they are also in such bad case , that I know not how they will be able to arrive in England . The number of men we have taken are about and hundred and fortie , and fifteen e noble captains of their best sort , and some of them rich , as well may appear by their behaviour : I have no other thing to write at this time .
