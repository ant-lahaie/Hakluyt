having found out such a place as we desired , but the wind would not suffer us to come near it , and again if we could have ankored there , it was thought likely that they would rather run themselves a ground to save their lives and liberties , and some of their goods , then come forth to lose their liberties and goods to us their enemies . So we shot at them to see if we could reach them , but it fell far short . And thus we departed , thinking it not probable that they would come forth so long as we watched for them before the havens mouth , or within sighed of them . For the space of five days after we put off to sea , and lay without sighed of them , and sent a pinnace to lie out of sighed close by the shore , to bring us word if they should come forth . After a while the Pinnace returned and told us that those ships in the Haven had taken down their sails , and let down their top masts : so that we supposed they would never come forth , till they perceived us to be quite gone . Wherefore upon the 20 of October , hearing that there were certain Scottish ships at Saint Michael , we sailed thither , and found there one Scottish reader , and two or three more at Villam Franca , the next road a league or two from the town of S . Michael , to the Eastwards : of whom we had for our relief some small quantity of wine ( viz . some five or sixe buttes of them all ) and some fresh water , but nothing sufficient to serve our turn . Upon Tuesday the one and twentieth of October , we sent our long boat to shore for fresh water at a brook a little to the Westwards from Villam Franca . But the Inhabitants espying us came down with two [ II ii . 161 . ] Ensigns displayed , and about some hundred and fiftie men armed , to withstand our landing .
