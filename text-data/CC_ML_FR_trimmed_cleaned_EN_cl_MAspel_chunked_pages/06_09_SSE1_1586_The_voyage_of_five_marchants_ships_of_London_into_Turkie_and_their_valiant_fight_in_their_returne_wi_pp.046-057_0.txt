A true report of a worthy fight , performed in the voyage from Turkic , by five Ships of London , against 11 . Galleys , and two Frigates of the King of Spaines , at Pantalarea within the Straights , Anno , 1586 . Written by Philip Jones . He Merchants of London , being of the incorporation of the Turky trade , having received intelligences , and advertisements , from time to time , that the King of Spaine grudging at the prosperity of this kingdom , had not only of late arrested all English ships , bodies , and goods , in Spaine , but also maligning the quiet traffic which they used to and in the dominions , and provinces , under the obedience of the Great Turke had given order to the Captains of his galleys in the 46 Levant , to hinder the passage of all English ships , and to endeavour by their best means , to intercept , take , and spoil them , their persons , and goods : they hereupon thought it their best course to set out their fleet for Turkey , in such strength and ability for their defence , that the purpose of their Spanish enemy might the better be prevented , and the voyage accomplished with greater securi tie to the men and ships . For which cause , five tall , and stout ships , appertaining to London , and intending only a Merchants voyage , were provided and furnished with all things belonging to the Seas ; the names whereof were these : i . The Merchant Royal , a very brave and good ship , and of great report . 2 . The Tobie . 3 . The Edward Bonaventure . 4 . The William , and John . 5 . The Susan . These five departing from the coast of England , in the month of November 1585 . kept together as One fleet , till they came as high as the Isle of Sicile , within the Levant . And there , according to the order and direction of the voyage , each ship began to take leave of the rest , and to separate himself , setting his course for the particular port ,
