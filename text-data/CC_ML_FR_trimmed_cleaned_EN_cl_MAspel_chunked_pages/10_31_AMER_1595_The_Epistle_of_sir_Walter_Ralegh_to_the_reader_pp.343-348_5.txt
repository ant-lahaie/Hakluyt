enforced to defend it self may be compared to a body dangerously diseased , which for a season may be preserved with vulgar medicines , but in a short time , and by little and little , the same must needs fallen to the ground , & be dissolved . I have therefore laboured all my life , both according to my small power , & persuasion , to advance all those attempts , that might either promise return of profit to our selves , or at least be a let and impeachment to the quiet course and plentiful trades 347 of the Spanish nation , who in my weak judgement by such a war were as easily endangered & brought from his powerfulness , as any prince of Europe , if it be considered from how many kingdoms and nations his revenues are gathered , & those so weak in their own beings , and so far severed from mutual succour . But because such a preparation and resolution is not to be hoped for in haste , & that the time which our enemies embrace , cannot be had again to advantage , I will hope that these provinces , and that Empire now by me discovered shall suffice to inable her Majesty & the whole kingdom , with no less quantities of treasure , then the king of Spaine hath in all the Indies East and West , which he possesses , which if the same be considered and followed , ere the Spaniards enforce the same , and if her Majesty will undertake it , I will be contented to loose her highness favour & : good opinion for ever , and my life withal , if the same be not found rather to exceed , then to equal whatsoever is in this discourse promised or declared . I will now refer the Reader to the following discourse , with the hope that the perilous and chargeable labours and endeavours of such as thereby seek the profit and honour of her Majesty , and the English nation , shall by men of quality and virtue receive such construction , and good acceptance , as themselves would look to be rewarded withal in the like .
