which have neither camels nor horses . 148 Of the tree which bears Bombasin cotton , or Gossampine . IN Persia is great abundance of Bombasin cotton , & very fine : this grows on a certain little tree or brier , not passed the height of a men waste or little more : the tree hath a slender stalk like unto a brier , or to a carnation gillifloure , with very many branches , bearing on every branch a fruit or rather a cod , growing in round form , containing in it the cotton : and when this bud or cod comes to the bigness of a walnut , it openeth and shows forth the cotton , which grows still in bigness until it be like a fleece of wool as big as a men fist , and begins to be lose , and then they gather it as it were the ripe fruit . The seeds of these trees are as big as peason , and are black , and somewhat flat , and not round ; they sow them in plowed ground , where they grow in the fields in great abundance in many countries in Persia , and diverse other regions . The writing of the Persians . ARthur Edwards showed me a letter of the Sophy , written in their letters backward , subsigned with the hands both of the Sophy & his Secretary . The Sophies subscription was only one word ( his name I suppose was Shaugh ) written in golden letters upon read paper . The whole letter was also written on the same piece of read paper , being long & narrow , about the length of a foot , and not passed three inches broad . The private signet of the Sophy was a round printed mark about the bigness of a royal , only printed upon the same paper without any wax or other seal , the letter seem so mishapen and disordered , that a man would think it were somewhat scribbled in manner at adventures . Yet they say that almost every letter with his prick or circunflexe signifies a whole word . Insomuch that in a piece of paper as big as a men hand their writing doth contain as much as doth ours almost in a sheet of paper .
