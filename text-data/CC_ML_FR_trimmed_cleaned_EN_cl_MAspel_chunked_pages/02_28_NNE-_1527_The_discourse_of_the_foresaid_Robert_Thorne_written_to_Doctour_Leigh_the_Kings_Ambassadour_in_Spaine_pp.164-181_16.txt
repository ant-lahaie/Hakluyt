Equinoctial for much heat the land was unhabitable . Yet since ( by experience is proved ) no land so much habitable nor more temperate . And to conclude , I think the same should be found under the North , if it were experimented . For as all judge , Nihil fit vacuum in rerum natura : So I judge , there is no land unhabitable , nor Sea innavigable . If I should write the reason that presents this unto me , I should be too prolix , and it seems not requisite for this present matter . God knoweth that though by it I should have no great interest , yet I have had and still have no little mind of this business : So that if I had faculty to my will , it should be the first thing that I would understand , even to attempt , if our Seas Northward be navigable to the Pole , or no . I reason , that as some sicknesses are heredi - tarious , and come from the father to the son , so this inclination or desire of this discovery I inherited of my father , which with another merchant of Bristow nam Hugh Eliot , were the discoverers of the New found lands , of the which there is no doubt , ( as now plainly appears ) if the mariners would then have be ruled , and followed their Pilots mind , the lands of the West Indies ( from whence all the gold comes ) had be ours . For all is one coast , as by the Card appears , and is aforesaid . Also in this Card by the coasts where you see C . your Lordship shall understand it is set for Cape or headland , where I . for Hand , where P . for Port , where R . for River . Also in all this little Card I think nothing be erred touching the situation of the land , save only in these Hands of Spicery : which , for that ( as afore is said ) every one sets them after his mind
