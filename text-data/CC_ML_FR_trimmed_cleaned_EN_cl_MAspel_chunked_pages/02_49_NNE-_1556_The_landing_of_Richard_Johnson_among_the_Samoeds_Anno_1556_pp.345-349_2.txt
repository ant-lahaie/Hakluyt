which are in subjection to the Emperor of Russia , when they will remove from one place to another , then they will make sacrifices in manner following . Every kindred doth sacrifice in their own tent , and he that is most ancient is their Priest . And first the Priest doth begin to play upon a thing like to a great sieve , with a skin on the one end like a drum : and the stick that he plays with is about a spann e long , and one end is round like a ball , covered with the skin of and Heart . Also the Priest hath upon his head a thing of white like a garland , and his face is covered with a piece of a shirt of mail , with many small ribs , and teeth of fish , and wild beasts hanging on the same mail . Then he sings as we use here in Englande to hallow , whope , or shout at hounds , and the rest of the company answer him with this Owtis , Igha , Igha , Igha , and then the Priest replieth again with his voices . And they answer him with the selfsame words so many times , that in the end he becomes as it were mad , and falling down as he were dead , having nothing on him but a shirt , lying upon his back I might perceive him to breathe . I asked them why he lay so , and they answered me , Now doth our God tell him what we shall do , and whither we shall go . And when he had lyen still a little while , they cried thus three times together , Oghao , Oghao , Oghao , and as they use these three calls , he riseth with his head and lies down again , and then he rose up and sang with like voices as he did before : and his audience answered him , Igha , Igha , Igha . Then he commanded them to kill five Olens or great Dear , and continued singing still both he and they as before . Then he took a sword of a cubit and a span long , ( I did meet it my self ) and put it into his belly halfway and sometime less , but no wound was to be seen , 347 A . D . 1556 . Store
