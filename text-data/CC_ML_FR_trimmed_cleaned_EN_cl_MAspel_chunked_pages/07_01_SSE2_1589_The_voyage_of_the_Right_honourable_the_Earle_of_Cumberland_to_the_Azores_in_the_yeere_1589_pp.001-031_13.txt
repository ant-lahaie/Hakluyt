of the chief men of the Island , who agreed with my Lord that he should have of them sixtie buttes of wine , and fresh victuals to refresh himself and his company withal : but as for fresh water , they could not satisfy our need therein , having themselves little or none , saving such as they saved in vessels or cisterns when it rained , and that they had rather give us two tons of wine then one of water : but they requested that our soldiers might not come on shore , for they themselves would bring all they had promised to the waterside , which request was granted , we keeping one of them aboard with us until their promise was performed , and the other we sent to shore with our empty Cask , and some of our men to help to fill , and bring them away with such other provision as was promised : so the Margaret , Captain Davis his ship , and another of Weymouth stayed riding at anchor before the Town , to take in our provision . This ship of Weymouth came to us the day before , and had taken a rich Prize ( as it was reported ) worth sixteene thousand pound , which brought us news that the West - Indian Fleet was not yet come , but would come very shortly . But we with the Victory put off to sea , and upon Saturday the fourth of October , we took a French ship of Saint Malo ( a city of the unholy league ) laden with fish from Newfoundland : which had been in so great a tempest , that she was constrained to cut her main mast overboard for her safety , and was now coming to Graciosa , to repair her self . But so hardly it befell her , that she did not only not repair her former losses , but lost all that remained unto us . The chief of her men we took into our ship , and sent some of our men , mariners , and soldiers into her to bring her into England . Upon
