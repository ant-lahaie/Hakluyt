careful , painful , diligent , and true every one in his room and place for the benefit and profit of the company : That hereafter in the absence of others they may be called and placed in the like room there or elsewhere . And if you find any to be disobedient and stubborn , and will not be ruled ; we will you shall send him home in our ships : who shall find such small favour and friendship during the time that he hath to serve , as by his disobedience and evil service he hath deserved . And whereas Christopher Hodson hath written to come home , as partly he hath good cause , considering the death of his father and mother : yet in regard that Sir George Bairn and the Lady his wife were his special friends in his absence , we doubt not but that he will remain in the room , which we 406 have appointed him , if you do not tarry and remain there , till farther order be taken : and for his service and pains he shall be considered , as reason is , as friendly as if his friends were living . Thus we trust you will take such order the one to remain at the Mosco , and the other at Colmogro , or elsewhere , as most need is . Thomas Alcocke is desirous to be in the Mosco : nevertheless you shall find him reasonable to serve where he may do most good . The 62 robles which you received of John Boucher we have paid him here , and also the 8 robles , which you received the year before of Christopher Rose , and the money which you received more of George Burton , for the which we have you our debtors . Thus we rest , referring that which is here omitted to the report of the bringer : and so God have you in his keeping . Also we would that you should send us in our ships 200 horse - clothes more . The things before written we would that you should let our servants see and read , to the intent they may perceive our minds .
