Country and kingdom , the king being wheresoever his pleasure is to be out of his kingdom , that every fifteene days there goes from Pegu a Carovan of Falchines , with every one a basket on his head full of some fruits or other deli - Martavan a title under the king of Pegu . A custom that these people have when the king is in the tvarres . cates of refreshings , and with clean clothes : it chanced that this Carovan passing by Martavan , and resting themselves there a night , there happened between the Portugales and them words of despite , and from words to blows , and because it was thought that the Portugales had the worse , the night following , when the Falchines were a sleep with their company , the Portugales went and cut off five of their heads . Now AlawlnPegu there is a law in Pegu , that whosoever kills a man , ktlltns he shall buy the shed blood with his money , according ' to the estate of the person that is slain , but these 415 Falchines being the servants of the king , the Retors durst not do any thing in the matter , without the consent of the king , because it was necessary that the king should know of such a matter . When the king had knowledge thereof , he gave commandment that the malefactors should be kept until his coming home , and then he would duly minister justice , but the Captain of the Portugales would not deliver those men , but rather set himself with all the rest in arms , and went every day through the City marching with his Drum and ensigns displayed . For at that time the City was empty of men , by reason they were gone all to the wars and in business of the king : in the midst of this rumour we came thither , and I thought Great pride of it a strange thing to see the Portugales use such in - the Portugales . soiencie ; n another men City .
