about with sands and shelves about 10 . leagues from land , and there is but two fathom water : from the said Cape to the bank of the other , there is about 15 . leagues . We being a cross the said Capes , discovered another land and Cape , and as far as we could ken , it lay North and by East . All that night the weather was very ill , and great winds , so that we were constrained to bear a small sail until the next morning , being the thirde of July when the wind came from the West : and we sailed Northward to have a sighed of the land that we had left on the Northeast side , above the low lands , among which high and low lands there is a gulf or breach in some places about 55 . fathom deep , and 15 . leagues in breadth . By reason of the great depth and breadth of the gulf , and change of the lands , we conceived hope that we should find a passage , like unto the passage of The Castles . The said gulf lies East Northeast , and West southwest . The ground that lies on the Southside of the said gulf , is as good and easy to be manured , and full of as goodly fields and meadows , as any that ever we have seen , as 196 plain and smooth as any die : and that which lies on the North is a country altogether hilly , full of woods , and very high and great trees of sundry sorts : among the rest there are as goodly Ceders , and Fir trees , as possibly can be seen , able to make masts for ships of three hundred Tun : neither did we see any place that was not full of the said trees , except two only that were full of goodly meadows , with two very fair lake ' s . The midst of the said Bay is 47 . degrees and half in latitude . Trees
