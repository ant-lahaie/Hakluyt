Majesty . And therefore it were needful that your Majesty should commit the charge and government into the hands of Diego Sierva , with express charge that all the captains & commanders upon pain of death obey him and be ready at all times to aid and assist him in your service . Otherwise this country cannot be kept and maintained , having so great wars continually as we have , and are troubled withal . For this Diego Sierva is a very good soldier , and hath good experience ; and is fit to govern this ; country . Your Highness is also to send him Commission with express commandment to follow these wars ; otherwise this country cannot be kept , but daily they will rebel . For here are none that will serve your Majesty so justly as he will do : who will have a great care in any thing which shall concern your Majesties service touching the estate of this country . For the Governor Sousa does Two Forts to be built at Cabodelo . The country spend your Majesties treasure in building his own Ingenios or sugar - mills . And those Captains which your Majesty intends to send hither must bring with them shot , powder , and all kind of weapons , furniture , and munition for the defence and safeguard of this country , and for the conquest of Rio Grande . For there is no kind of munition in all this country to be had , if occasion should serve . It were also good that your Majesty should send order for the building of a couple of Forts or Castles at Cabodelo , for they be very needful for the defence of the enemy , which daily does war against this Captainship . For that man which shall govern this country , if he be no more fortunate than I have be hitherto , shall not miss one time or another , but he shall .. lose all the country . If DONE Francisco de Sousa had danger Jdayly sent me t ^ 086 two hundred and fiftie soldiers which I to be lost . did send for , which were in garrison in the castle of Arrecife , which do nothing but spend your Majesties victuals and treasure
