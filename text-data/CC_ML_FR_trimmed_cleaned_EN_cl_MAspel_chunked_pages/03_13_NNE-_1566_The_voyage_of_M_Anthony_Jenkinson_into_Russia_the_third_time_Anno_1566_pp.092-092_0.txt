A very brief remembrance of a voyage made by M . Anthony Jenkinson , from London to Moscovia , sent from the Queens Majesty to the Emperor , in the year 1566 . He fourth day of May in the year aforesaid , I embarked my self at Gravesend in the good ship called the Harry of London , and having had a prosperous voyage arrived at the bay of S . Nicholas in Russia the 10 . day of July following , and immediately I sent in post to the Emperor to advertise of my coming , and traveling then thorough the country , I with my company came to the Mosco where the Emperor kept his court , the 23 . of August , and forthwith gave the Secretary to understand of my arrival , who advertised the Emperors Majesty of it , and the first day of September , being a solemn feast among the Russes , I came before the Emperors Majesty , sitting in his seat of honour , and having kissed his hand and done the Queens Majesties commendations , and delivered her Graces letters and present , he bade me to dinner , which I accepted , and had much honour done unto me both then and all the time of my abided in Russia .
