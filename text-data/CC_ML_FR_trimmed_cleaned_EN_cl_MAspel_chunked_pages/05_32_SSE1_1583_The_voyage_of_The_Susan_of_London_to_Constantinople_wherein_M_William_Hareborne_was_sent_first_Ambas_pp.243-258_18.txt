stayed at the Council chamber door they were telling or weighing of money to send into Persia for his Soldiers pay . There were carried out and hundred and three and thirty bags , and in every bag , as it was told us , one thousand ducats , which amounteth v 257 R to three hundred and thirty thousand * , and in sterling English money to fourescore and nineteene thousand pounds . The Captain of the guard in the mean time went to the great Turke , and returned again , then they of the Court made obeisance to him , bowing down their heads , and their hands on their breasts , and he in like order resaluted them : he was in cloth of silver , he went and came with two or three with him and not more . Then we went out at the first gate , and there we were commanded to stay until the Captain of the guard was passed by and all his guard with him , part before him and part behind him , some on horseback and some on foot , but the most part on foot carrying on their shoulders the money before mentioned , and so we passed home . There was in the Court during our abided there , for the most part a fool resembling the first , but not naked as was the other at the Bassas : but he turned him continually , & cried Hough very hollowly . The third of May I saw the Turke go to the church : he had more then two hundred and fifty horses before and behind him , but most before him . There were many empty horses that came in no order . Many of his Nobility were in cloth of gold , but himself in white satin . There did ride behind him sixe or seven youths , one or two whereof carried water for him to drink as they said . There were many of his guard running before him and behind him , and when he alighted , they cried Hough very hollowly , as the aforesaid fools .
