, nor by any other trial ! . The first sign of land were certain fowls which they knew to be of India : the second , boughs of palms and sedges : the third , snakes swimming on the water , and a substance which they call by the name of a coin of money , as broad and as round as a groat , wonderfully printed and stamped of nature , like unto some coin . And these two last signs be so certain , that the next day after , if the wind serve , they see land , which we did to our great joy , when all our water ( for you know they make no beer in those parts ) and victuals began to fail us . And to Goa we came the foure and twentieth day of October , there being received with passing great charity . The people be tawny , but not disfigured in their lips 8c noses , as the Moors and Caffes of Ethiopia . They that be not of reputation , or at least the most part , go naked , saving and apron of a span long , and as much in breadth before them , and a lace two fingers broad before them , girded about with a string and no more : and thus they think them as well as we with all our trimming . Of the fruits and trees that be here I cannot now speak , for I should make another letter as long as this . For hitherto I have not seen a tree here , whose like I have seen in EurOpe ? the vine excepted , which nevertheless here is to no purpose , so that all the wines are brought out of Portugall . The drink of this country is good water , or wine of the Palm tree , or of a fruit called Cocos . And this shall suffice for this time . If God send me my health , I shall have opportunity to write to you once again . Now the length of my letter compelleth me to take my leave : and thus I wish your most prosperous health . From Goa the tenth of November , 1579 . our loving son Thomas Stevens .
