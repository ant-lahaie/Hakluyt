A letter of Sir Francis Walsingham to M . Richard Hakluyt then of Christchurch in Oxford , encouraging him in the study of Cosmography , and of furthering new discoveries , etc . Understand aswell by a letter I long since received from the Mayor of Bristoll , as by conference with Sir George Pekham , that you have endeavoured , & given much light for the discovery of the Western parts yet unknown : as your study in these things is very commend - able , so I thank you much for the same ; wishing you do continue your travel in these and like matters , which are like to turn not only to your own good in private , but to the public benefit of this Realm . And so I bid you farewell . From the Court the 11 . of March . 1582 . Your loving Friend , Francis Walsingham .
