but a just plague purposely sent by God upon the Spaniards , and that it might truly be said , the taking of the Revenge was justly revenged upon them , and not by the might or force of man , but by the power of God , as some of them openly said in the lie of Tercera , that they 86 believed verily God would consume them , and that he took part with the Lutherans and heretics : saying further that so soon as they had thrown the dead body of the Viceadmiral Sir Richard Greenfield overboard , they verily thought that as he had a devilish faith and religion , and therefore the devils loved him , so he presently sunk into the bottom of the sea , and down into hell , where he raised up all the devils to the revenge of his death : and that they brought so great storms and torments upon the Spaniards , because they only maintained the Catholic & Romish religion . Such and the like blasphemies against God , they ceased not openly to utter , without being reproved of any man therein , nor for their false opinions : but the most part of them rather said and affirmed , that of truth it must needs be so . As one of those Indian fleets put out of Nova Spagna , there were 35 of them by storm and tempest cast away and drowned in the Sea , being 50 in all ; so that but 15 escaped . Of the fleet that came from Santo Domingo there were 14 cast away , coming out of the channel of Havana , whereof the Admiral and Viceadmiral were two of them : and from Terra Firma in India there came two ships laden with gold and silver , that were taken by the Englishmen : and before the Spanish army came to Corvo , the Englishmen at times had taken at the least 20 ships , that came from S . Domingo , India , Brasilia , etc . and were all sent into England . 87
