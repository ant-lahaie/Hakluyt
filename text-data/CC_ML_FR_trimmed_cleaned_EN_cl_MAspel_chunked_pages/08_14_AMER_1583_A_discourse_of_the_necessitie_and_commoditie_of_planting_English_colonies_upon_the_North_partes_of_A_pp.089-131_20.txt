â€™ whose decease his lib . sons Honorius and Arcadius were created Emperors , 106 1583 . the one of the East , the other of the West , who with all stout godliness most carefully imitated the foresteps of their Father , either in enlarging their territories , or increasing the Christian flock . Moreover , it is reported by the said author , that Theodosius junior the Emperor , no whit inferior in virtuous life to any of the above nam Princes , with great study and zeal pursued and prosecuted the Gentiles , subdued their tyrants and countries , and utterly destroyed all their idolatry , converting their souls to acknowledge their only Messias and Creator , and their Countries to the enlargement of the Empire . To be brief , who so lists to read Eusebius Pamphilus , Socrates Scholasticus , Theodoritus , Hermia , Sozomen , and Euagrius Scholasticus , which all were most sage Ecclesiastical ! writers , shall find great store of examples of the worthy lives of sundry Emperors , tending all to the confirmation of my former speeches . And for like examples of later time , ( yea even in the memory of man ) I shall not need to recite any other then the conquest made of the West and East Indies by the Kings of Spaine and Portugal ! , whereof there is particular mention made in the last Chapter of this book . Herein have I used more copy of examples then otherwise I would have done , saving that I have be in pl ^ ce , where this manner of planting the Christian faith hath be thought of some to be scarce lawful , yea , such as do take upon them to be more then meanly learned . To these examples could 1 join many more , but whosoever is not satisfied with these few , may satisfy himself in reading at large the Authors last above recited . Thus have I ( as I trust ) proved that we may justly trade and traffic with the Savages , and lawfully plant and inhabit their Countries . [
