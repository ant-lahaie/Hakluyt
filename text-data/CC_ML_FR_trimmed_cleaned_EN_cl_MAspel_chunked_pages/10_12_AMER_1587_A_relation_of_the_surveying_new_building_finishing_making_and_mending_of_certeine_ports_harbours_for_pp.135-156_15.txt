very well , if the enemy should chance to come into the harbour , and be succoured and helped by the 147 citizens , and twenty musketeers being planted upon a mount which lies over the fort , will be sufficient to defend us from a good many of our enemies , that should come to assault us , because all the country is full of rocks and stones , and full of mountains . So from this wood there may a way be made to go to the city , and to join with that way which shall go to Panama ; and this may be done with small charges . This harbour does lie in nine degrees and one tierce , and if occasion should serve we may stop up the way which does go to Capira , and the rest of the ways which go from Number de Dios to Venta de Cruzes , according as it is certified me by the Negroes called Simerons ; for they told me that this way would not be very troublesome . Although in the Winter it is reported that here is good store of water in this place , which in the Summer is all dried up , and where these waters are , there we may build a causey , to which purpose there are great quantities of stones and timber very serviceable : so this way may be made with that treasure which your majesty doth receive of the averages and customs of Number de Dios and Panama , which does amount unto twelve or foureteene thousand pezos yearly : and and order might be taken for the same , that the said money may serve for the building and repairing of these ways . Panama . PAnama is the principali city of this Diocese : it lies 18 . leagues from Number de Dios on the South sea , and stands in 9 . degrees . There are 3 .
