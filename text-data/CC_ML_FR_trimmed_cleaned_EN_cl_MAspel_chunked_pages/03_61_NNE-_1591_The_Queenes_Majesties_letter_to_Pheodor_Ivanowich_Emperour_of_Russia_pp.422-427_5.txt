We therefore entreat your Majesty , that as conveniently as may be , satisfaction or recompense be given to our said merchant ' s towards the repairing of their sundry great losses aswell therein as otherwise by them of late sundry ways sustained . And lastly , our most deer and loving brother , as nothing in all these our occasions is to be preferred before our entire league and amity , descending upon us as and inheritance , in succession from both our ancestors and noble progenitors : so let us be careful on both sides by all good means to hold and continue the same to our posterity for ever . And if any mistaking or error of either side do rise , in not accomplishing of circumstances agreeable to the fashion of either of our countries ' and kingdoms , let the same upon our interchangeable letters be reconciled , that our league and amity be no way impeached for any particular occasion whatsoever . And thus we recommend your Majesty to the tuition of the most High . From our royal Palace of Whitehall the 14 of January , anno Domini 1591 . The Emperor seized our merchant ' s goods .
