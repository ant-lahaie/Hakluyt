, they were content to suffer us to lodge within their town , and themselves to go to their wives , whom they had carried into other places of the country before our coming thither . At every streets end they had raised very fine Barricados of earth - works , with trenches without them , as well made as ever we saw any work done : at the entering whereof was some little resistance , but soon overcome it was , with few slain or hurt . They had joined with them many Indians , whom they had placed in corners of advantage , all bowmen , with their arrows most villanously empoisoned , so as if they did but break the skin , the party so touched died without great marvel : some they slew of our people with their arrows : some they likewise mischieved to death with certain pricks of small sticks sharply pointed , of a foot and a half long , the one end put into the ground , the other empoisoned , sticking fast up , right against our coming in the way , as we should approach from our landing towards the town , whereof they had planted a wonderful number in the ordinary way : but our keeping the sea - wash shore missed the greatest part of them very happily . I overpass many particular matters , as the hurting of Captain Sampson at sword blows in the first entering , unto whom was committed the charge of the pikes of the Vanguard by his lot and turn ; as also of the taking of Alonso Bravo the chief commander of Ahnto Bravo that place by Captain Goring , after the said captain had first hurt him with his sword : unto which Captain was committed the charge of the shot of the said Vanguard . Captain Winter was likewise by his turn of the Vanguard in this attempt , where also the Lieutenant general marched himself : the said Captain Winter through a great desire to serve by land , having now exchanged his charge by sea with Captain Cecil for his band of footmen . 119 Captain Powel
