. The two foresaid rivers , namely Tanais & Etilia , otherwise called Volga , towards the Northern regions through the which we traveled , are not distant asunder above x . days journey , but Southward they are divided a great space one from another . For Tanais descendeth into the sea of Pontus : Etilia makes the foresaid sea or lake , with the help of many 260 other rivers which fall thereinto out of Persia . And we had to the South of us huge high mountains , upon the sides whereof , towards the said desert , do the people called Cergis , and the Alani or Acas inhabit , who are Ker & s or as yet Christians , & wage war against the Tartars . Aas - Beyond them , next unto the sea or lake of Etilia , there are certain Saracens called Lesgi , who are in subjection unto the Tartars . Beyond these is Porta ca ferrea , or the iron gate , now called Derbent , which Alexander built to exclude the barbarous nations out of Persia . Concerning the situation whereof , your majesty shall understand more about the end of this Treatise : for I travailed in my return by the very same place . Between the two foresaid rivers , in the â€™ regions through the which we passed did the Comanians of old time inhabit , before they were overrun by the Tartars . Of the Court of Sartach , and of the magnificence thereof . Chap . 17 . A Nd we found Sartach lying within three days journey of the river Etilia : whose Court seemed unto us to be very great . For he himself had sixe wives , and his eldest son also had three wives : every one of which women hath a great house , & they have each one of them about 200 . carts . Our guide went unto a certain Nestorian nam Coiat , who is a man of great authority Calat the in Sartachs Court . He made us to go very far unto Nestorian . the Lords gate .
