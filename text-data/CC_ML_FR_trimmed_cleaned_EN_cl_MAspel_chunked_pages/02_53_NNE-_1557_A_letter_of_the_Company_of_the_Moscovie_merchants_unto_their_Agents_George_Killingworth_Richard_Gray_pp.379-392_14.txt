lade it for our accounts , and to come at our adventure , and he to be paid at the return of the ships in Velvets , Sattens , or any other kind of silk , or cloth of gold , cloth of tissue , or according as his Commission shall be that he shall send us in the ships , and according to such patterns as he shall send . we do not find the Ambassador now at the last so conformable to reason as we had thought we should . He is very mistrustful , and thinketh every man will beguile him . Therefore you had need to take heed how you have to do with him or with any such , and to make your bargains plain , and to set them down in writing . For they be subtle people , and do not always speak the truth , and think other men to be like themselves . Therefore we would have none of them to send any goods in our ships at any time , nor none to come for passengers , unless the Emperor do make a bargain with you , as is aforesaid , for his own person . Also we charge you not to suffer any of our nation to send any wares to their wives or friends in any of our ships ; but to take their money there to be paid here by the company and not otherwise : and to have consideration how you do take the roble . For although we do rate it after sixteene shillings eight pence of our money , yet it is not worth passed 12 . or 13 . shillings sterling . Moreover , you had need to send new accounts , for them that came in the 391 Edward be marred and torn , so that we can make no reckoning by them : and likewise to write us a perfect note of all the goods which you received the last voyage out of the Edward , and herein not to fail .
