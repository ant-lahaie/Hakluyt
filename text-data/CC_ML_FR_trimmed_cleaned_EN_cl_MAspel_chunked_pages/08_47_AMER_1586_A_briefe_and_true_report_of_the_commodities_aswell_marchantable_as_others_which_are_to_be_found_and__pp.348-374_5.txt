rise in short time great profit to the dealers therein , seeing there is so great use and vent thereof aswell in our country as elsewhere . And by the means of sowing and planting it in good ground , it will be far greater , better , and more plentiful then it is . Although notwithstanding there is great store thereof in many places of the country growing naturally and wild , which also by proof here in England , in making a piece of Silk grogran , we found to be excellent good .

Although it hath not be our hap to have found such plenty , as elsewhere to be in the country we have herd of , yet seeing that the country does naturally breed and nourish them , there is no doubt but if art be added in planting of Mulberry trees , and others , fit . for them in commodious places , for their feeding & nourishing , and some of them carefully gathered & husbanded in that sort , as by men of skill um 353 z is known to be necessary : there will rise as great profit in time to the Virginians , as thereof does now to the Persians , Turks , Italians and Spanyards .
