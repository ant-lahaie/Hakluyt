Not long after the same time ( three days as I remember ) the galleys that were run on ground , did quit themselves also out of that place , and by the bridge of the Hand called Puente de Sua ? oh , made their way round about the same Hand , and so by putting themselves to the main sea , escaped to a town called Rotta , not far off , but something up towards the Town of Saint Lucars , and there purchased their safety by that means . Thus was this notable victory , as well by sea as by land , both begun and in effect performed , within the compass , in a manner , of fourteene hours : A thing in truth so strange and admirable , as in my judgement will rather be wondered at then believed of posterity . And if ever any notable exploit in any age was comparable to Caesars Veni , Vidi , Vici , certainly in my poor opinion it was this . 2S4 Here it is to be wished ( and perchance of some too it is looked for ) that every men particular worthy act in this days service , with the parties names also , should be put down , that thereby both they and their good deserts might be registered to all posterity : and for my part I would it were so , and wish I were able to do it . But for that I confess it is a matter that passes my power , yea , and for that I think it also a thing impossible to be precisely performed by any other , I am to crave pardon for that I rather leave it out altogether , then presume to do it maimedly : and in this point I refer the Reader only to the Map that is set forth of this journey , where it is in some part conveniently touched and specified . The Town of it self was a very beautiful town , and a large , as being the chief See of the Bishop there , and having a goodly Cathedral Church in it
