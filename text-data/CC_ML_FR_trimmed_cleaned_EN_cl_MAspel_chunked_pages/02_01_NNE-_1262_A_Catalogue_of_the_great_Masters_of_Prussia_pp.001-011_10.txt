of Rome , unto the Emperor , unto the princes and electors of Germany , and prevailed with them so far forth , that there was a day of hearing appointed at Posna in Polonia . And the Legates of both parts meeting herd complaints and excuses , & dispatched no other business . In the mean time Prince Frederick deceased in the tenth year of his government . The 34 . Master was Albertus marks of Brandenburg , whom the King of Polonia did so grievously molest with war , and oppressed all Prussia with such extreme rigour , that the Prince of the country was constrained to make a league of foure years with him , and to yield unto such conditions , as turned to the utter overthrow of the whole Order . And among other conditions are these which follow . Since that the originali of all discord between Polonia and the order doth from hence arise , for that hitherto in Prussia , no lawful heir and successor hath born rule and authority , but diverse and sundry have had the government thereof , by whose means the nations have be provoked one against another , much Christian blood hath been shed , the lands and inhabitants grievously spoiled , and many widows and Orphans made : the Popes , Emperor ' s , and Princes being often solicited for the establishing of that perpetual league , which Casimir hath heretofore concluded etc . Since also that the truce which hath be agreed upon of both parties is in short time to be expired , and that it is to be feared , that bloody wars will then be renewed , and that all things will prove worse and worse , unless some lawful composition be made , and some good and wholesome devise be put in practice , as well for the benefit of the King and of his posterity , as for the commodity of the whole common weal of Prussia , especially considering that Albertus the Marques refuseth not to submit himself to the Council of the King , etc .
