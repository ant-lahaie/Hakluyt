The 13 we were put into Dartmouth , and there we stayed until the 12 of December . From thence We put out with the wind at West , and the 18 of December , God be praised , we anchored at Limehouse in the Thames , where we discharged 589 sacks of Pepper , 150 Elephants teeth , and 32 barrels of oil of Palm trees . The commodities that we carried out this second voyage were Broad cloth , Kersies , Baize , Linen cloth , Iron unwrought , Bracelets of Copper , Coral , Hawks bells , Horsetailes , Hats , and such like . This voyage was more comfortable unto us then the first , because we had good store of fresh water , and that very sweet : for as yet we have very good water in the ship which we brought out of the river of Benin the [ II ii . 133 . ] first day of Aprill 1591 . and it is at this day ( being the 7 of June 1592 . ) to be seen aboard the ship as clear and as sweet as any fountain can yield . In this voyage we sailed 350 leagues within half a It is more degree of the equinoctial line , and there we found it « « ' more temperate , then where we road . And under the line we did kill great store of small Delphines , and on the ’ coast of many other good fish , and so did we all the way , Guinie & which was a very great refreshing unto us , and the fish Benin - never forsook us , until we were to the Northwards of the Hands of Azores , and then we could see no more fish , but God be thanked we met with good company of our country ships which were great comfort unto us , being five months before at Sea without any company .
