foresaid subject ' s , among other matters they spoke on this wise unto them : Do you complain of injuries & losses offered unto you ? Loe , in your own country of Prussia there are English merchants , & goods sufficient , go your ways home therefore , & recover your losses , taking two for one : and in this manner they were left , & so departed . Afterwards returning unto you land of Prussia , they & their friends repaired unto the Mast , general , jointly & wl one consent making their complaint unto him of the losses which had been inflicted upon them by your subject ' s . And prostrating themselves at his feet , they all and every of them made their humble suits , y â€˜ he would have compassion on them , as upon his poor subject ' s , regarding them selves , their wives , & children , and pitying their distres , and penury , and that he would graciously procure some redress for them . And when he offered his letters unto them , wishing them to prosecute their cause before your highness , they answered that they were no way able to defray the expenses , and that others , who were in like sort damnified , had laboured that way altogether in vain & to no purpose : beseeching him again and again , that he would by another kind of means , namely by arresting of your merchants and their goods , procure them restitution of their losses . At length the Master general The arresting being moved by so many and so great complaints , and by the molestation of his subject ' s , caused ( albeit full a ^ ants soar against his will ) a certain portion of English merchants goods to be laid hold on , and to be arrested , in his cities of Elburg & Dantzik , and to be bestowed in sure places , until such time as he might conveniently by his messengers propound and exhibit all and singular the premises unto your highness . And forasmuch as the foresaid Master general and our Order do know no just occasion , whereby they have deserved your majesties indignation , but are firmly and most undoubtedly persuaded , to find all courtesy , favour ,
