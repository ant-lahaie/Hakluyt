written Trollhualur . Neither doth Troll signify the devil , as you interpret it , but certain Giants that live in mountains . You see therefore ( and no marvel ) how you err in the whole word . It is no great injury to our language being in one word only : because ( doubtless ) you knew not more then one . Others also do offend in the same fault , for it is not to be allowed that a certain man being about to publish a Map of Island received from Islanders themselves , had rather mar the fashion of all , or in very deed of the most names of Capes , Bays , mountains , springs , rivers , hammocks , valleis , hills & towns ( because that being ignorant of our language , he was not able to read those things aright , which he received from our countrymen ) he had rather ( I say ) deprave & corrupt them all , then learn of the Islanders themselves , which at that time , namely in the year 1585 . lived in the university of Hafnia , or Copen Hagen , how every thing ought to be read and written . And we esteem him for this his wilful marring of our native names and words , ( whereupon it came to pass that we reading the same , could acknowledge very few to be our own ) that he is no slight offender against our tongue , otherwise retaining the pure and the ancient property . But now we have after some sort examined most of the miracles of Island , which our writers have mentioned . Notwithstanding before we enter into any 139 farther matter , we think it good in this section to touch that which the last forenamed man ( in this Map of Island , that he caused to be put forth in you foresaid year under his own name ) hath given out concerning two other fountains beside the former : whereof the one should die white wool black , & the other black wool white .
