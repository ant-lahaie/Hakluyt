he answered : We have no such custom . Whereupon I conjectured that they were indeed Christians : but , that for lack of instruction they omitted the foresaid ceremony . For I saw there behind a certain chest ( which was unto them in steed of and altar , whereupon they set candles and oblations ) and image having wings like unto the image of Saint Michael , and other images also , holding their fingers , as if they would bless some body . That evening I could not find any thing else . For the Saracens do only invite men thither , but they will not have them speak of their religion . And therefore , when I inquired of the Saracens concerning such ceremonies , they were offended thereat . On the morrow after were the Kalends , and the Saracens feast of Passeover . And changing mine Inn or lodging the same day , I took up mine abided near unto another idole - Temple . For 285 the citizens of the said city of Cailac do courteously invite , & lovingly entertain all messengers , every man of them according to his ability and portion . And entering into the foresaid idole - Temple , I found the Priests of the said idols there . For always at the Kalends they set open their Temples , and the priests adorn themselves , and offer up the peoples oblations of bred and fruits . First therefore I will describe Frier William was at Caracarum . unto you those rites and ceremonies , which are common unto all their idole - Temples : and then the superstitions of the foresaid Jugures , which be , as it were , a sect distinguished from the rest . They do all of them worship towards the North , clapping their hands together , and prostrating themselves on their knees upon you earth , holding also their foreheads in their hands . Whereupon the Nestorians of those parts will in no case join their hands together in time of prayer : but they pray , displaying their hands before their breasts .
