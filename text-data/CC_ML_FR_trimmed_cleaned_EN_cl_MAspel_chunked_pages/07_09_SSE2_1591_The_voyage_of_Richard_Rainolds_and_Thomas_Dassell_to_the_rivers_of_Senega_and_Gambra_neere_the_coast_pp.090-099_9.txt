succour and defend us . In which people appeared more confident love and goodwill towards us , then ever we shall find either of Spaniards or Portugals , though we should relieve them of the greatest misery that can be imagined . In the river of Senega no Spaniard or Portugall use to trade : and only one Portugall called Ganigoga dwells far within the river , who was married to a kings daughter . In the towns of Porto d ’ Ally and Joala , being towns of chiefest trade , and in the towns of Canton and Cassan in the river of Gambra are many Spaniards and Portugals resident by permission of the Negroes ; who have rich trades there along the coast , especially to San Domingo and Rio grande , not far distant from Gambra river ; whither they transport the iron which they buy of Frenchmen and us , and exchange it for Negroes ; which be carried continually to the West Indies in such ships as came from Spaine . Also by the governors order and Renters of Castle de Mina and other places , where gold is , upon the coast of Guinea , they have a place limited how far they must go to trade within the river of Gambra ; and further they may not go upon pain of confiscation of their goods , and loss of life : for that the Renters themselves send at certain times their own ■ 98 ' 594 - barks within the river to such places , where as they have great store of gold . And in all these places hereabout , mb tr ^ e where we use to trade , they have no Fort , Castle , or ™ place of strength , but only trading by the Negroes safe - ' conduct and permission . And the most part of the Spaniards and Portugals that be resident in these places be banished men or fugitives , for committing most heinous crimes and incestuous acts , their life & conversation being agreeable ; and they are of the basest behaviour that we have ever seen of these nations in any other country .
