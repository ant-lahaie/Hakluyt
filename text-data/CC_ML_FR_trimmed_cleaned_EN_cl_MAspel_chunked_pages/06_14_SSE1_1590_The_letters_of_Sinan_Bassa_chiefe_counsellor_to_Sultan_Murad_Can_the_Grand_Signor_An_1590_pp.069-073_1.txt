them , and also that he would better his gift , which he hath for many years heretofore ordinarily sent unto the porch of his imperiali Highness . Howbeit his imperiali majesty ( upon whom the almighty creator hath bestowed so great power , and who vouchsafeth to give ear unto all humble suppliants ) rejecting the supplication of the King of Poland , determined again to send his army against the said king , and by the help of the Almighty creator , utterly to subvert and overthrow his kingdom . By your Majesties Ambassador resident in the blessed and glorious porch of his imperiali Highness interposing himself as a mediator , signifying that from the parts of Poland you were furnished with corn , gunpowder , masts of ships , guns , and other necessaries , and craving peace on the behalf of the kingdom and king of Poland , and making intercession , that the said king might not be molested nor troubled by the means of the Grand Signor , & declaring that this was your Majesties most earnest desire ; so soon as the report and intercession of your Majesties Ambassador was signified unto the Grand Signor , for your sake , unto whom all honour and favourable regard is due , upon the condition aforesaid , namely , that the wicked Cosacks might be sought out and grievously punished , or that their offences might be remitted for the valve of some small gift , upon this condition ( I say ) the letters of his imperiali Highness were sent unto the king of Poland . Howbeit had not this conclusion of league and amity been solicited on the behalf of your Majesty , his imperiali Highness would never have vouchsafed the same unto the kingdom of Poland . But for your Majesties sake his imperiali Highness hath exhibited this so singular a favour unto the said king and kingdom of Poland . And hereof your Majesty and the king of Poland ought certainly to be persuaded . We wish your Majesty most happily and well to fare . Given at Constantinople in the end of the month called Sabaum , in the year of our sacred prophet Mahomet 998 , and in the year of Jesus 1590 , the 12 of June .
