A letter written to M . Richard Hakluyt of the middle Temple , containing a report of the true state and commodities of Newfoundland , by M . Anthonie Parkhurst Gentleman , 1578 . Aster Hakluyt , after most hearty commendations , with like thanks for your manifold kindness to me showed , not for any merits that hitherto have been mine , but wholly proceeding , I must needs confess , of your own good nature , which is so ready pressed to benefit your country and all such poor men as have any spark in them of good desires , that you do not only become their friend , but also - humble your self as servant in their affairs : for which I would to God I were once in place where I might cause your burning zeal to be known to those that have authority , power , and ability to recompense your traveling mind and pen , wherewith you cease not day nor night to labour and travel to bring your good and godly desires to some pass , though not possibly to that happy end that you most thirst for : for such is the malice of wicked men the devils instruments in this our age , that they cannot suffer any thing ( or at least few ) to proceed and prosper that tendeth to the setting forth of Gods glory , and the amplifying of the Christian faith , wherein hitherto princes have not be so diligent as their calling required . Alas , the labourers as yet are few , the harvest great , I trust God hath made you and instrument to increase the number , and to move men of power , to redeem the people of Newfoundland and those parts from out of the captivity of that spirituali Pharao , the devil . Now to answer some part of your letter touching the sundry navies that come to Newfoundland , or Terra nova , for fish : you shall understand that some fish not near the other by 200 . leagues , and therefore the certainty is not known ; and some years come many more English , then other some , as I see the like among us : who since my first travel being but 4 . years , are increased from 30 . sail
