The same in English . THe most famous navigation of the English men by the Northeast sea hath offered unto me a great occasion , and certain direction for the reformation of the map of Europe : which discovery hath the Northern parts of Finmarke , Lapland , and Moscovie , laid out according to the just elevation and the quarters of the world . And further , the true observation of the latitude of the city of Mosco , made by the foresaid Englishmen , hath yielded me and infallible rule , for the correcting of the situation of the inland countries : which notable helps being ministered unto me , I thought it my duty to exhibit to the world this Map , more exact and perfect then hitherto it hath be published . 460 Another testimony of Joannes Metellus Sequanus concerning the same Navigation and Discoveries in his Preface prefixed before Osorius de rebus gestis Emanuelis Regis Portugalli ^ , written about the year , 1574 . The same in English . BUt least all and the whole glory of discovering the Ocean sea should be ascribed to the Spaniards , the Englishmen about twentie years past , by a new navigation into Moscovie , discovered the Northeast parts . For they by reason of the wars of Swethland being hindered from the traffic of the Moscovites and of the Narve in Liefland , opened a passage for themselves by the Ocean sea , beyond the Northern latitude of 70 . degrees : having in their course on the one side the coasts of Norway , Finmark , Lapland , Scrickfin and Biarmia : On the other side the coast of Gronland . 461 A . D . J574 - Which voyage the Hollanders afterward entered into , but not without some conflict with the English . They carry thither old plate and course linen cloth , and all kind of small Mercery wares , serving for the appareling of men and women , as linen , and silk girdles , garters , purses , knives , and many such like things . And they bring away from the Moscovites , all kind of precious Furs , and Salmons salted and dried in the smoke .
