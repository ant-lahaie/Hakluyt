East by North : but we imagined ourselves to be 16 . or 17 . leagues off from the shore . The 16 . we came to and anchor about 4 . or 5 . of the clock after nonne , the people came presently to us after the old manner , with crying Ilyaoute , and showing us Seals skins . The 17 . we began to set up the pinnace that Peerson framed at Dartmouth , with the boards which he brought from London . The 18 . Peerson and the Carpenters of the ships began to set on the planks . The 19 . as we went about and Island , were found black Pumise stones , and salt kerned on the rocks , very white and glistering . This day also the Master of the Sunshine took of the people a very strong lusty young fellow . The 20 . about two of the clock in the morning , the Savages came to the Island where our pinnace wks built ready to be launched , and tore the two upper strikes , and carried them away only for the love of the iron in the boards . While they were about this practice , we manned the Elizabeths boat to go a shore to them : our men being either afraid or amazed , were so long before they came to shore , that our Captain willed them to stay , and made the Gunner give fire to a Saker , and laid the piece level with the boat which the Savages had turned on the one side because we should not hurt them with our arrows , and made the boat their bulwark against the arrows which we shot at them . Our Gunner having made all things ready , gave fire to the piece , and fearing to hurt any of the people , and regarding the owners profit , thought belike he would save a Sakers shot , doubting we should have occasion to fight with men of war , and so shot off the Saker without a bullet : we looking still when the Savages that were hurt should run away without legs , at length we could perceive never a man hurt ,
