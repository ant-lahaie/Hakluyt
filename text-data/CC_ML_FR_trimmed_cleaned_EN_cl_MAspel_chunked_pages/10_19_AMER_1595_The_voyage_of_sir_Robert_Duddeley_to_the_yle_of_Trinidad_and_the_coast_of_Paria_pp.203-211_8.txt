hearing by a Pilot , that the Spanish fleet meant now to put out of Havana ) to bear for the Meridian of the isle of Bermuda , hoping there to find the fleet dispersed . The fleet I found not , but foul weather enough to scatter many fleets ; which companion left me not in greatest extremity , till I came to the isles of Flores and Cuervo : whither I made the more haste , hoping to meet some great Fleet of her Majesty my sovereign , as 1 had intelligence , and to give them advice of this rich Spanish fleet : but finding none , and my victuals almost spent , I directed my course for England .

Thus leaving her by necessity in this miserable estate , I made for England , where I arrived at S . Ives in Cornewall 210 about the latter end of May 1595 , escaping most dangerously in a great fog the rocks of Silly .

John de Luz in France laden with fish only from Newfoundland . In this voyage I and my fleet took , sunk and burned nine Spanish ships ; which was loss to them , though I god nothing .
