The coins , weights and measures used in Russia , f1 - 256 - ] written by John Hasse , in the year , 1554 . Orasmuch as it is most necessary for all merchants which seek to have traffic in any strange regions , first to acquaint themselves with the coins of those lands with which they do intend to join in traffic , and how they are called from the valuation of the highest piece to the lowest , and in what sort they make their payments , as also what their common weights and measures be : for these causes I have thought good to write some thing thereof according to mine own knowledge and experience , to the end that the merchants of that new adventure , may the better understand how the wealth of that new frequented trade will arise . First , it is to be noted that the Emperor of Russia hath no other coins then silver in all his land , which goes for payment among merchant ' s , yet notwithstanding there is a coin of copper , which serves for the relief of the poor in Mosco , & no where else , and that is but only for quasse , water and fruit , as nuts , apples , and such other like . The name of which money is called Pole or Poles , of which Poles there go to the least of the silver coins , 18 . But I will not stand upon this , because it is no currant money among merchant ' s . Of silver coins there be three sorts of pieces : the least is a Poledenga , the second a Denga , the third , Nowgrote , which is as much to say in English as halfpenny , penny , and twopence , and for other valued money then this , there is none : there are oftentimes there coins of gold , but they come out of foreign countries ' , whereof there is no ordinary valuation , but they pass according to the agreement of merchant ' s . Their order in summing of money is this : as we say n No coins of gold in Russia , but all of silver . 273 in England , halfpenny , penny , shilling and pound ,
