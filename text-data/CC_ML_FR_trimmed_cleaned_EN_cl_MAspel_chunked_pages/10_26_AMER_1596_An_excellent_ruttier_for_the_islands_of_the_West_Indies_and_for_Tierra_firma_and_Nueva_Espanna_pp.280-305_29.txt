the Caio de Moa , as I told you , keep 2 . leagues from the Pracel or shoaled : and then set our course West unto the low islands of the Firm land . And upon this course you shall ken the Flats on the Caio Romano , point of Caio Romano : and within it is one Flat higher then the other , and smooth upon , and in the midst it makes as it were broken land ; and when you are in the channel in the day time , you must take heed you come not near the shore by 2 . leagues , and by your sounding no nearer then 3 . fathoms . And you must take heed still when you night comes to keep 2 . or three leagues off for fear of the shoalds . And in the night you must go Northwest as is aforesaid . And also you must take heed that you keep in the middle of the channel , as never as you can towards thee shoaled . And finding much wind & being benighted , from midnight till day stir West Northwest , and when it is towards day , then you may edge towards the Flats as is aforesaid . Alcane de Barasoga . Savano . Basque . The Flats of Mecala . And as you stir hence one day and one night from Caio Romano to the inward of the Channel , you shall see the firm land of Cuba , and other marks ; and among the rest , a round hamocke , which you may easily know . It is called Alcane de Barasoga . And from thence to Savano and to Basque is 6 . leagues , and likewise Havana 6 . leagues . And from thence to cross under the Fort is 45 . leagues . And stir hence upon your course aforesaid . And if you have gone from Barasoga 30 . leagues , you shall see none of the Flats of Mecala : And give them a breadth off two or three leagues , and keep your course West Northwest ,
