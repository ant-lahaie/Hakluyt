one hundred at a time , and would give me fish dried , Salmon , Salmon peal , Cod , Caplin , Lump , Stone - base and such like , beside diverse kinds of birds , as Partridge , Pheasant , Gulls , Sea birds and other kinds of flesh : I still laboured by signs to know from them what they knew of any sea towards the North , they still made signs of a great sea as we understood them , then I departed from that coast , thinking to discover the North parts of America : & after I had sailed towards the West 40 leagues , I fell upon a great bank of ice : the wind being North and blue much , I was constrained to coast the same towards the South , not seeing any shore West from me , neither was there any ice towards the North , but a great sea , free , large very salt and blue , & of and unsearchable depth : So coasting towards the South I came to the place where I left the ships to fish , but found them not . Then being forsaken & left in this distress referring my self to the merciful providence of God , I shaped my course for England , & unhoped for of any , God alone relieving me , I arrived at Dartmouth . By this last discovery it seemed most manifest that the passage was free & without impediment towards the North : but by reason of the Spanish fleet & unfortunate time of M . Secretary ' s death , the voyage was omitted & never since attempted . The cause why I use this particular relation of all my proceedings for this discovery , is to stay this objection , why hath not Davis discovered this passage being thrice that ways employed ? How far I proceeded & in what form this discovery lies , does appear upon the Globe which M . Sanderson to his very great charge hath published , for the which he deserveth great favour & commendations .
