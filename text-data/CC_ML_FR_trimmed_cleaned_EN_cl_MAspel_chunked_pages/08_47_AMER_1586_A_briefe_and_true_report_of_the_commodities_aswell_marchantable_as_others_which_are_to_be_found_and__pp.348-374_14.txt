in one corner of the plot , with a pecker they make a hold , wherein they put foure grains , with care that they touch not one another ( about and inch asunder ) & cover them with the mould 361 again : and so throughout the whole plot making such holes , and using them after such manner , but with this regard , that they be made in ranks , every rank differing from other half a fathom or a yard , and the holes also in every rank as much . By this means there is a yard spare ground between every hold : where according to discretion here and there , they set as many Beans and Peaze ; in diverse places also among the seeds of Macocquer , Melden , and Planta solis . The ground being thus set according to the rate by us experimented , and English acre containing forty perches in length , and foure in breadth , does there yield in crop or ofcome of corn , Beans and Peaze , at the least two hundred London bushels , beside the Macocquer , Melden , and Planta solis ; when as in England forty bushels of our Wheat yielded out of such and acre is thought to be much . I thought also good to note this unto you , that you which shall inhabit , and plant there , may know how specially that country corn is there to be preferred before ours : beside , the manifold ways in applying it to victual , the increase is so much , that small labour & pains is needful in respect of that which must be used for ours . For this I can assure you that according to the rate we have made proof of , one man may prepare and husband so much ground ( having once born corn before ) with less then foure and twenty hours labour , as shall yield him victual in a large proportion for a twelvemonth , if he have nothing else but that which the same ground will yield , and of that kind only which I have before spoken of : the said
