, being Saterday , we were proceeded as far as Montii , with whom our foresaid associates and servants remained , which were withheld from us , and we caused them to be delivered unto us . From hence we travailed unto Corrensa , to whom , requiring gifts the second time at our hands , we gave none , because we had not wherewithal ! . And he appointed us two 178 Comanians , which lived among the common people of the Tartars , to be our guides unto the city of Kiow in Russia . Howbeit one of our Tartars parted not from us , till we were passed the utmost guard of the Tartars . But the other guides , namely the Comanians , which were given us by Corrensa , brought us from the last guard unto the city of Kiow , in the space of sixe days . And there we arrived fifteene days before the feast of Saint John Baptist . Moreover , the Citizens of Kiow having intelligence of our approach , came forth all of them to meet us , with great joy . For they rejoiced over us , as over men that had be risen from death to life . So like wise they did unto us throughout all Russia , Polonia , and Bohemia . Daniel and his brother Wasilico made us a royal feast , and entertained us with them against our wills for the space of eight days . In the mean time , they with their Bishops , and other men of account , being in consultation together about those matters which we had propounded unto them in our journey towards the Tartars , answered us with common consent , saying : that they would hold the Pope for their speciali Lord and Father , and the Church of Rome for their Lady & mistress , confirming likewise all things which they had sent concerning this matter , before our coming , by their Abbate . And for the same purpose , they sent their Ambassadors and letters by us also , unto our Lord the Pope .
