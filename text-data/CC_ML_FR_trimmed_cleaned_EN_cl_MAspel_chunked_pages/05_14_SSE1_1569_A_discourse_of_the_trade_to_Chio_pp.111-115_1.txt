Turkey is ten in every hundreth . English men do buy more commodities of Chio then any other nation . the service of king Philip against the Turke . Moreover , whensoever the Turke made out any army , he perceived that no nation did him more hurt then those Genouois , who were his tributaries .

Insomuch , that if one of our ships should go thither , it would be for the customers profit 4000 ducats at least , whereas if we should not trade thither , he should loose so much . Also the burgesses , and the common people would be very glad of our trade there , for the Communally do get more by our countrymen then they do by any other nation whatsoever : for we do use to buy many of their silk quilts , and of their Scamato and Dimite , that the poor people make in that town
