The description of the country of Russia , with the breadth , length , and names of the Shires . He country of Russia was sometimes called Sarmatia . It changed the name ( as some do suppose ) for that it was parted into diverse small , and yet absolute governments , not depending , nor being subject the one to the other . For Russe in that tongue doth signify as much as to part , or divide . The Russe reporteth that foure brothers , Trubor , Rurico , Sinees , and Varivus divided among them the North parts of the country . Likewise that the South parts were possessed by 4 . other , Kio , Scieko , Choranus , and their sister Libeda : each calling his territory after his own name . Of this partition it was called Russia , about the year from Christ 860 . As for the conjecture which I find in some Cosmographers , that the Russe nation borrowed the name of the people called Roxellani , & were the very same nation with them , it is without all good probability , both in respect of the 357 Strabo in his etymologic of the word ( which is very far fetched ) and especially for the seat and dwelling of that people , which was betwixt the two rivers of Tanais and Boristhenes , ( as Strabo reporteth ) quite another way from the country of Russia . When it bore the name of Sarmatia , it was divided into two chief parts : the White and the Black . The white Sarmatia was all that part that lies towards the North , & on the side of Liefland : as the provinces now called Dwina , Vagha , Ustiug , Vologda , Cargapolia , Novo - grodia , etc . whereof Novogrod velica was the Metropolite or chief city . Black Sarmatia was all that country that lies Southward towards the Euxin or Black sea : as the dukedom of Volodemer , of Mosco , Rezan , etc . Some have thought that the name of Sarmatia was first taken Gen . 10
