custody of M . John Stow a diligent preserver of Antiquities . Cabots voyage from Bristol wherein he discovered ' Newfound land , y the Northern parts of that land , and from thence as far almost as Florida . N the 13 . year of K . Henry the 7 . ( by means of one John Cabot a Venetian which made himself very expert and cunning in knowledge of the circuit of the world and Hands of the same , as by a Sea carded and other demonstrations reasonable he showed ) the king caused to man and victuali a ship at Bristow , to search for and Island , which he said he knew well was rich , and replenished with great commodities : Which ship thus manned and victualed at the kings cost , diverse Merchants of London ventured in her small stocks , being in her as chief patron the said Venetian . And in the company of the said ship , sailed also out of Bristow three or foure small ships fraught with sleight and gross merchandizes , as course cloth , caps , laces , points & other trifles . And so departed from Bristow in the beginning of May , of whom in this Majors time returned no tidings . 154 Of three Savages which Cabot brought home and presented unto the King in the fourteenth year of his reign , mentioned by the foresaid Robert Fabian . His year also were brought unto the king three men taken in the Newfound Island that before I spoke of , in William Purchas time being Mayor : These were clothed in beasts skins , & did eat raw flesh , and spoke such speech that no man could understand them , and in their demeanour like to bruit beasts , whom the King kept a time after . Of the which upon two years after , I saw two appareled after the manner of Englishmen in Westminster palace , which that time I could not discern from Englishmen , till I was learned what they were , but as for speech , I herd none of them utter one word .
