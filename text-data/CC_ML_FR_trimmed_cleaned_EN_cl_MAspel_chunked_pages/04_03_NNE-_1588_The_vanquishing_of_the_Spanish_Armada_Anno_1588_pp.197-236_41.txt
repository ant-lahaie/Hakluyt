. ’ 34 AD SERENISSIMAM ELIZABETHAM ANGLIC REGINAM . THEODOR . BEZA . Traverat innumeris Hispanus navibus aequor , Regnis juncturus sceptra Britanna suis . Tanti hujus , rogitas , quae motus causa ? superbos Impulit Ambitio , vexit Avaritia . Quam bene te ambitio mersit vanissima ventus ? Et tumidos tumidae vos superastis aquae ! Quam bene totius raptores orbis avaros , Hausit inexhausti justa vorago maris 1 At tu , cui venti , cui totum militat aequor , Regina , d mundi totius una , decus , Sic regnare Deo perge , ambition remota , Prodiga sic opibus perge juvare pios , Ut te Angli longum , longiim Anglis ipsa fruaris , Quam dilecta bonis , tam metuenda malis . The same in English . THe Spanish Fleet did float in narrow Seas , And bend her ships against the English shore , With so great rage as nothing could appease , And with such strength as never seen before : And all to join the kingdom of that land Unto the kingdoms that he had in hand . Now if you ask what set this king on fire , To practise war when he of peace did treat , It was his Pride , and never quenched desire , To spoil that Islands wealth , by peace made great : His Pride which far above the heavens did swell , And his desire as unsuffic ’ d as hell . But well have winds his proud blasts overblown , And swelling waves allayed his swelling heart , Well hath the Sea with greedy gulfs unknown , Devoured the devourer to his smart : And made his ships a prey unto the sand , That meant to pray upon another ' s land . 235 And now , Oh Queen , above all others blessed , For whom both winds and waves are pressed to fight , So rule your own , so succour friends oppressed , ( As far from pride , as ready to do right ) That England you , you England long enjoy , No less your friends delight , then foes annoy .
