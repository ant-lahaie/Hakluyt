about a league from us we saw 33 < 5 1584 . three Hands called Las tres Marias , ( that is to say , The three Maries ) running the same course . About foure leagues from the other Hands , there are other Hands , reaching about two or three leagues : All this way from the mouth or gulf of California aforesaid , for the space of the said fourescore leagues , there are great streams that run Westward . From the point or Cape de las Corrientes , we ran Southeast , and sometime Southeast and by East , for the space of and hundred and thirtie leagues to the haven of Acapulco . In this way of and hundred and thirtie leagues , being twentie leagues on the way , we had the haven of Natividad , that is , of the birth of the Virgin Marry : and other eight leagues further , the haven of Saint Iago , or Saint James : and sixe leagues further , the sea Strand called La Playa de Colima , that is , the Strand of Colima . All this coast from California to the haven of Acapulco is Acapulco . inhabited by people that have peace and traffic with the Spaniards , and are of condition and qualities like the people of the other places of new Spaine . The conclusion of the Author of this last voyage . A LI this description and navigation have I my self scene , proved , and well noted in my voyage made & ended in the year of our Lord 1584 . from great China out of the haven and river of Canton , as I will more at large set it down unto your honour , with the longitudes and latitudes thereof , as God shall permit me time and leisure , whom I beseech to send you long and happy days . And the same was truly translated out of Spanish into low Dutch verbatim out of the Originali copy , ( which was sent unto the Viceroy of the Portugall Indies ) by John Huyghen Van Linschoten .
