And in the sea after you set off from your port , you shall orderly at the end of every foure glasses found , and if you find ground , note the depth and what ground , but if you can find no ground , you shall also note in what depth you could find no ground . 5 Also that you do diligently observe the flowing , & ebbing in every place , and how the tides do set , which way the flood does come , and how much water it does high in every place , and what force the same tide hath to drive a ship in and hour , as near as you can judge it . 6 Also that you do seek to observe with the instrument which I deliver you herewith , according as I taught you at Rose Island , the true platforms , and distances , in as many places as conveniently you may , for it serves very aptly your purpose . 7 Also that you take with you paper and ink , and keep a continual jour nail or remembrance day by day , of all such things as shall fallen out worth the knowledge , not forgetting or omitting to write it , and note it , that it may be showed and read at your return . 123 8 These order if you shall diligently observe , it will be easy for you to make a plate and perfect description of your discovery , and so shall your notes be sufficient to answer that which is looked for at your hands . But withal you may not forget to note as many things as you can learn and understand by the report of any people whatsoever they be , so that it appertain any way to our desires .
