pieces of ordinance , to warn the Christopher , and then we went our course for England : she hearing our pieces followed us , and we carried a light for her , but the next day in the morning it was thick , and we could not see her in the afternoon neither , so that we suspected that either she was gone with Spaine , or else that she should put forth more sails then we in the night , and was shot a head of us , so that then we put forth our topsails , and went our course with England . At the time when the Christopher left us , we were within 120 leagues of England , and 45 leagues Northwest and by West from Cape Finister : and at the same time in our ships we had not above sixe Mariners and sixe Merchants in health , which was but a weak company for such a ship to seek a foreign harbour . The 16 day , about sixe of the clock at night , we met with a great storm at the Westsouthwest , & West , and our men being weak , and not able to Extreme handle our sails , we lost the same night our main « eaineueof sail , foresail , and spreetsaile , & were forced to lie a mrmen ' hulling , until the eighteenth day , and then we made ready and old course of a foresail , and put it to the yard , and therewith finding our selves far shot into the [ II ii . 52 . ] sleeve , we bore with our own coast ; but that before - ’ S1 sail continued not above two hours , before it was blown from the yard with a freat , and then we were forced to lie a hull again , until the nineteenth day of October in the morning , and then we put and old bonnet to our foreyard , which , by the good blessing and providence of God , brought us to the He of Wight , where we arrived the 20 of October in the afternoon .
