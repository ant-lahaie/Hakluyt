other prison of condemned persons shall you go at three iron gates , the court paved and vaunted round about , and open above as it were a cloister . In this cloister be eight rooms with iron doors , and in each of them a large gallery , wherein every night the prisoners do lie at length , their feet in the stocks , their bodies hampered in huge wooden grates that keep them from sitting , so that they lie as it were in a cage , sleep if they can : in the morning they are losed again , that they may go into the court . Notwithstanding the strength of this prison , it is kept with a garrison of men , part whereof watch within the house , part of them in the court , some keep about the prison with lanterns and watch - bells answering one another 3 ‚Äù A . D . c . 1565 . five times every night , and giving warning so loud , that the Loutea resting in a chamber not near thereunto , may hear them . In these prisons of condemned persons remain some 15 , other 20 . years imprisoned , not executed , for the love of their honourable friends that seek to prolong their lives . Many of these prisoners be shoemakers , and have from the king a certain allowance of rise : some of them work for the keeper , who suffers them to go at liberty without fetters and boards , the better to work . Howbeit when the Loutea calls his check roll , & with the keeper views them , they all wear their liveries , that is , boards at their necks , yronned hand and foot . When any of these prisoners dieth , he is to be seen of the Loutea and Notaries , brought out of a gate so narrow , that there can but one be drawn out there at once . The prisoner being brought forth , one of the aforesaid Partitions striketh him thrice on the head with and iron sledge , that done he is delivered unto his friends
