When these hounds had done that act , they went to the church of saint John and took down the tombs of the great master ' s , and sought if there were any treasure hid in them , and they forced certain women and maidens . And all they that were christened and had be Turkes afore , were they men , women or children , and children that the said men had made Christians , they led into Turkey , which thing is of greater importance then any of the other . The morrow after Christmas day , the reverend lord great master went to the great Turkes pavilion for to visit him , and to be better assured of his promise , the which lord he made to be well & graciously received . And he signified unto him by his interpreter , that the case so happened to him was a thing usual and common ; as to lose towns and lordship ' s , and that he should not take overmuch thought for it : and as for his promise , he bade that he should not doubt in any thing , and that he should not fear any displeasure to his person , and that he should go with his people without fear . With these words the said lord thanked him , and took his leave and departed . FINIS . Lenvoy of the Translator .
