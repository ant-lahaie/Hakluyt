stuflfe unwrought , as also to take charge of the stuflfe wrought , & to foresee that neither the yarn be burned in tarring , nor the hemp rotted in the watering ; and also to furnish them so with labourers , workmen and stuflfe , as hereafter when these workmen shall come away , we be not destitute of good workmen , and that these may dispatch as much as possibly they may , doing it substantially : for we esteem it a principal commodity , and that the Counsel Cables and of England does well allow . Let all diligence be a 1 â„¢ - used , that at the return of these ships we may see clP ^ commQ ' samples of all ropes & cables if it be possible , and so after to continue in work , that we may have good store against the next year . Therefore they have need to 381 Dansk the old chief place for Cables . Commodities not bearing have a place to work in , in the winter : and at any hand let them have help enough to spin their stuff : for seeing you have great plenty of hemp there , and at a reasonable price , we trust we shall able to bring as good stuff from thence , and better cheap then out of Dansk : if it be diligently used , and have a good overseer . Let the chiefest lading of these foure ships be principally in wax , flax , tallow and train oil . And if there be any more wares then these ships be able to take in , then leave that which is least in value and grossest in stouage until the next shipping : for we do purpose to ground our selves chiefly upon these commodities , as wax , cables and ropes , train oil , flax and some linen yarn . As for Masts , Tar , Hemp , Feathers , or any such other like , they would not bear oflmgfraigkt charges to have any , considering our deer fraught . We have sent you a Skinner to be there at our charges for meat , drink and lodging ,
