be had , where Caiane falls into the sea , ( for it stands in the mouths of Wia and Caiane ; ) it yields safe and good harbour in foure and five fathom for ships of great burden . On all that coast we found not any like it : we therefore honoured this place by the name of Port Howard . The road under Triangle Islands , which are the Westermost from the rest and stand in five degrees , which have also store of fish , foul , deer and Iwanas , is good , but not comparable with this other , where in all winds and weather , ships , though they be many , may all ride securely . The hills and high lands are limits to this bay on each side : for to the Eastward beyond it appear none at all , and to the Westward of mount Hobbeigh very few . Where the mountains fail , there Brasill wood is no farther to be sought for : but in all parts cotton , pepper , silk and Balsamum trees do grow in abundance . The roots of the herb Wia - passa are here most plentiful : I find them in taste nothing different from good ginger , and in operation very medicinable against the flix and headache . These rivers , as also others nearer Raleana , do all fallen out of the plains of this empire over rocks , as the river 458 Caroli doth into Raleana : and in most places within the utmost hedge of woods , the land within is plain , void of trees , and bears short grass like Arromaiaries country . Next adjoining unto these , are the rivers Cunanamma , Uracco , Mawara , Mawarparo , Amonna , Marawini , Oncowi , Wiawiami , Aramatappo , Camaiwini , Shurinama , Shurama , Cupanamma , Inana , Guritini , Winitwara , Berbice , Wapari , Maicaiwini , Mahawaica , Wappari , Lemdrare , Dessekebe , Caopui , Pawrooma , Moruga , Waini , Barima , Amacur , Aratoori , Raleana . From Cape Cecyl to Raleana ,
