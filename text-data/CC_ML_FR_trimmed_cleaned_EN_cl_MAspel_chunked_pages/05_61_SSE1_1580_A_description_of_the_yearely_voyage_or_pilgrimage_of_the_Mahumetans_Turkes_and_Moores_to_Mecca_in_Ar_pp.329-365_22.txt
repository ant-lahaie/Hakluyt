thousands of angels , wherewith returning to the battle , they conquered and overcame the conqueror . And therefore in memory of this victory , the Carovan lodgeth every year one night in this place , making great bonfires with great mirth . And they say that as yet there is herd upon the mountains a little drum , which while the Carovan passes , never ceases sounding . And they say further , that the said drum is sounded by the angels in sign of that great victory granted of God to their prophet . Also the Mahometan writings affirm , that after the end of the said battle , the prophet commanded certain of his people to go and bury all the Mahometans which were dead in the fields , who going , knew not the one from the other , because as yet they used not circumcision , so they returned unto him , answering , that they had be to do his commandment , but they knew not the Musulmans from the 349 Christians . To whom the prophet answered , saying : Turn again , and all those which you shall find with their faces downward , leave them , because all they are misbelievers ; and the other which you shall find with their faces turned upward , them bury , for they are the true Musulmani , and so his commandment was done . The next morning by Sun rising , the Carovan arriveth at Bedrihonem , in which place every man washes himself from top to toe , as well men as women , and leaving ofF their apparel , having each one a cloth about their privities , called in their tongue Photah , and another white one upon their shoulders , all which can go to Mecca in this habit , do so , and are thought to merit more then the other , but they which cannot do so make a vow to sacrifice a Ram at the mountain of pardons : and after they be washed , it is not lawful for any man or woman to kill either flay or louse with their hands
