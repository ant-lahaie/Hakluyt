town all night , but must lie in their boats without the town . And their days being expired , if any man remain there , they are evil used and imprisoned . The 498 Chinians are very suspicious , and do not trust strangers . It is thought that the king does not know that any strangers come into his country . And further it is credibly reported that the common people see their king very seidome or not at all , nor may not look up to that place where he sitteth . And when he rides abroad he is carried upon a great chair or serrion gilded very fair , wherein there is made a little house with a latise to look out at : so that he may see them , but they may not look up at him : and all the time that he passes by them , they heave up their hands to their heads , & lay their heads on the ground , and look not up until he be passed . The order of China is when they mourn , that they wear white thread shoes , and hats of straw . The man does mourn for his wife two years , the wife for her husband three years : the son for his father a year , and for his mother two years . And all the time which they mourn they keep the dead in the house , the bowels being taken out and filled with chownam or lime , and coffined : and when the time is expired they carry them out playing and piping , and burn them . And when they return they pull off their mourning weeds , and marry at their pleasure . A man may keep as many concubines as he will , but one wife only . All the Chineans , Japonians , and Cauchin writing Chineans do write right downwards , and they do write with a fine pencil made of dogs or cats hair . â€™ Laban is and Hand among the Javas from whence come Laban . the diamonds
