lands allotted to every one of them , both to the greater and the less , according to their degrees . Whereof he that hath least , hath to yield him twentie rubbles or marks by the year . Beside these 15000 horsemen , that are of better choice ( as being the Emperor ' s own guard when himself goes to the wars , not unlike the Roman soldiers called Prsetoriani ) are a hundred and ten men of speciali account for their Nobility , and trust , which are chosen by the Emperor , and have their names registered , that find among them for the Emperor ' s wars , to the number of 65000 . horsemen , with all necessaries meet for the wars after the Russe manner . To this end they have yearly allowance made by the Emperor for themselves , and their companies , to the sum of 40000 rubbles . And these 65000 are to repair to the field every year on the borders towards the Crim Tartar ( except they be appointed for some other service ) whither there be wars with the Tartars , or not . This might seem peradventure somewhat dangerous for some state , to have so great forces under the command of Noblemen to assemble every year to one certain place . But the matter is so used , as that no danger can grow to the Emperor , or his state by this means . First , because these noblemen are many , to wit , and no . in all , & changed by the Emperor so oft as he thinketh 378 good . Secondly , because they have their livings of the Emperor , being otherwise but of very small revenue , and receive this yearly pay of 40000 rubbles , when it is presently to be paid forth again to the soldiers that are under them . Thirdly , because for the most part they are about the Emperor ' s person being of his Counsel , either speciali , or at large . Fourthly , they are rather as paymasters , then Captains to their companies
