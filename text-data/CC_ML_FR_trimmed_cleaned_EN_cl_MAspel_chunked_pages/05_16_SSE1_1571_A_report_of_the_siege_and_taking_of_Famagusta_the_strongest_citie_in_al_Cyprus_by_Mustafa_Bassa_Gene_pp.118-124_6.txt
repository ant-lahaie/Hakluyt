honourably , then in the defence of their country . Beside that the late blows , which the Turks have received since this their fury , in token of Gods wrath against them , do much comfort every Christian heart . Moreover this uniform preparation which is certainly concluded , and forthwith looked for , by very many Christian Princes ( would God by all generally ) against these barbarous Mahometists : whose cruelty and beastly behaviour I partly know , and am able to judge of , having be in Turky among them more then eight months together . Whose unfaithfulness also and breach of promise , as the Venetians manly courage in defence of themselves , and their fortress , your honour may easily read in this short treatise and small handful of leaves , I having set down also a short description of the Hand of Cyprus , for the better understanding of the whole matter . The which I not only most humbly beseech your honour now favourably to accept as and earnest penny of more to 123 come , and of my present good will : but with your accustomed goodness towards me , to defend the same against such persons , whose tongues too readily roll sometime against other men ' s painful travels , persuading themselves to purchase the sooner some credit of learning with the ruder sort , by controlling and overdaintie sifting of other men ' s laboured tasks . For I know in all ages to be found as well Basilisks as Elephants . Thus nothing doubting of your ready aid herein , as I assuredly trust of your honours favourable acceptation of this my poor present , wishing long life with the increase of Gods holy spirit to your lordship and to all your most honourable family ( unto whom I have wholly dedicated my self by mine own choice and election for ever ) I , craving pardon for my former boldness , most humbly thus take my leave . From Lambhith the 23 of March . Ann . 1572 . Your honours most humble and faithful servant for ever , William Malim .
