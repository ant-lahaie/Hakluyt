aboard together , crying , entrad , entrad : but our men received them so hotly , with small shot and pikes , that they killed them like dogs . And thus they continued aboard them almost a quarter of and hour , thinking to have devoured our men , pinnace and all . And surely to men judgement , no other thing was likely in regard of their great number , and the fewness of our men , and they at the first thought all was their own : but God , who is the giver of all victories , so blessed our small company , and so strengthened their arms and minds to fight , that the enemy having received a mighty foil , was glad to rid himself from their hands : and whereas at their marvellous entrance , we esteemed them to be no less then betwixt two hundred and three hundred men in the afewofour galley , we could scarce perceive twenty men at their men . departure stand on their legs , but the greater part of them was slain , many deadly wounded , their oars broken , & she departed from our men , hanging upon one side ( as a Sow that hath lost her left ear ) with 219 Above 360 Portugal & Indians slave . the number of dead and wounded men that lay one upon another . And whereas their coming aboard was in a great bravado , with drum , shouting , and crying , they departed without either noise of drum or speech . We lost in this conflict of our men , three only , which were Alexander the Master Gunners mate , Laurence Gambrel , a proper young man of Hampton , and another that was master Benmans man . Some also were hurt with the arrows of the enemy , but the wounds were curable : and thus it pleased Almighty God , of his great goodness , to give victory to 50 or 60 Englishmen , against sixe or seven hundreth Portugals and Indians , for which we ceased not to give such dutiful thanks to his Majesty
