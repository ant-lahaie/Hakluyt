Merchants , which did ease our fraught , and very commodiously we came to Basora and there we stayed 40 . days for providing a Carovan of barks to go to Babylon , because they use not to go two or 3 . barks at once , but 25 . or 30 . because in the night they cannot go , but must make them fast to the banks of the river , and then we must make a very good & strong guard , and be well provided of armour , for respect & safeguard of our goods , because the number of thieves is great that come to spoil and rob the merchants . And when we depart for Babylon we go a little with our sail , and the voyage is 38 . or 40 . days long , but we were 50 . days on it . When we came to Babylon we stayed there 4 . months , until the Carovan was ready to go over the wilderness , or desert for Alepo ; in this city we were 6 . Merchants that accompanied together , five Venetians and a Portugal ; whose names were as follows , Messer Florinasa with one of his kinsmen , Messer Andrea de Polo , the Portugal & M . Francis Berettin and I , and so we furnished our selves with victuals and beans for our horses for 40 . days ; and we bought horses and mules , for that they be very good cheap there , I my self bought a horse there for 11 . akens , and sold him after in Alepo for 30 . ducats . Also we bought a Tent which did us very great pleasure : we had also among us 32 . Camels laden with merchandise : for the which we paid 2 . ducats for every camels lading , and for every 10 . camels they made 11 , for so is their use and custom . We take also with us 3 . men to serve us in the voyage , which are used to go in those voyages
