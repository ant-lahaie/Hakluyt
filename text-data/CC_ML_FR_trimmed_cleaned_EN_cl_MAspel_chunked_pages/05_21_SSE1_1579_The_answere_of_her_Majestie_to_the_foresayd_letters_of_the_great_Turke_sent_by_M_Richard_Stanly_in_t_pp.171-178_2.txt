granted to your subject ' s by the aforesaid princes your confederates , as namely the king of the Romans , of France , of Poland , and the common wealth of Venice . In which matter , if your most invincible Imperiali highness shall vouchsafe to incline to our reasonable request , and shall give order upon these our letters , that we may have knowledge how the same is accepted of you , and whither it will granted , with sufficient security for our subject ' s to go , and return safe and secure from all violences and injuries of your people , we on the other side will give order , that those commodities which Almighty God hath bestowed upon our kingdoms ( which are in deed so excellent , that by reason of them all princes are drawn to enter , and confirm leagues of amity and good neighbourhood with us , by that means to enjoy these so great blessings of God , which we have , and they can in no case want ) our subject ' s shall bring them so abundantly and plentifully to the kingdoms and dominions of your highness , that both the former inconveniences of necessity , and loss , shall most sufficiently be taken away . Moreover the signification and assurance of your highness great affection to us and our nation , doth cause us also to entreat and use mediation on the behalf of certain of our subject ' s , who are detained as slaves and captives in your Galleys , for whom we crave , that forasmuch as they are fallen into that misery , not by any offence of theirs , by bearing of arms against your high - v 177 M ness , or in behaving of themselves contrary to honesty , and to the law of nations , they may be delivered from their bondage , and restored to liberty , for their service towards us , according to their duty : which thing shall yield much more abundant cause to us of commending your clemency , and of beseeching that God ( who only is above all things , and all men , and is a most severe revenger of all idolatry , and is jealous of his honour against the false gods of the nations ) to adorn your most invincible Imperiali highness with all the blessings of those gifts , which only and deservedly are accounted most worthy of asking . Given at our palace of Greenwich , near to our City of London , the five and twentieth day of October , in the year of Jesus Christ our Saviour one thousand , five hundreth , seventie and nine , and of our reign the one and twentieth .
