live in idleness . If there be no wars for their employment , he occupieth them in building of stately palaces , and in raising new fortresses , or in repairing and strengthening of old , and also in performing other notable works , to the ornament of Japan , and to his own lasting honour . So that at this present near unto Miac6 there are thirtie thousand men employed about the building of one castle ; and in the city of Bozacca above and hundred thousand : which employments afford them neither place nor time to practise any rebellions . The sixt is his altering of governments : for he removeth his governors from one extreme part of Japan to another . The seventh , for that unto his soldiers ( beside the ordinary pay continually allotted unto them for their service ) in time of war he alloweth victuals at his own costs . Whereof it comes to pass , that he effecteth whatsoever he thinks good by their means . Neither hath he hitherto waged any war , wherein his enemy was not vanquished , according to his own desire : this late war of China only excepted , which far surmounted all his forces . Howbeit in the kingdom of Coray he maintaineth as yet great garrisons , as well to keep his honour , as to constrain the Chinians to sue for peace . The eighth is , in that he curbeth and restraineth persons of ambitious and aspiring minds , who ( as he conjectureth ) after his death might work some innovations in the common wealth , or disturb the kingdoms . The ninth is , because he hath on no side within foure or five days journey of Miac6 , any mighty or industrious captain or governor . 44 Â° The tenth and last is , for that he hath brought his yearly revenues to two millions of gold . By these courses and means , we are in good hope that firm peace will be established in all these kingdoms , and also that a fit way will be prepared , for the conversion of all the great lords unto Christian religion .
