s Mate in the Edward Cotton , the 21 of October , Ann . 1584 . Rio grande . One Coxe and old English man buried alive by the Moors of Rio grande in Guinea . HE say , that the 17 day of July , Anno 1583 . having some lack of fresh water , they put room upon the coast of Guinie , where they were set upon a sand about 8 leagues from the shore , and this Examinate , with 29 more , god into the pinnace , who arrived in and Island , being desolate of people , and five miles in compass , where they rested 18 days through force of weather , having nought to eat but grass . The rest of the company the ship being split in two , and in quarters , god them into one of thee after quarters , and by the help of rafts came also a shore into another Island near to Rio grande , where they all died as he supposeth . The other 30 in the pinnace , at the end of 18 days , departed that Island , and came to Saint Domingo , where coming on shore , they were taken of the Moors , & stripped naked . And they buried one Coxe and old man alive , notwithstanding his pitiful lamentation and skrikings : the rest having Rice and water allowed them , lived there a certain time . This Examinate was at last sold to a Portugall , with whom he dwelled the space of a quarter of a year , and in the end , a Portugall Caravel coming thither , his master jaded the same with Negroes , and he obtained leave of his master to go in the same Caravel , & by that means arrived at Lisbone , and from thence came into England the 17 of October , 1584 , leaving behind him of his company alive , Richard Hacker , John Baker , John Mathew , and a boy , with two others which were gone beyond Saint Domingo : all which , as he says , were so sick and diseased , that he judgeth them to be long before this time dead .
