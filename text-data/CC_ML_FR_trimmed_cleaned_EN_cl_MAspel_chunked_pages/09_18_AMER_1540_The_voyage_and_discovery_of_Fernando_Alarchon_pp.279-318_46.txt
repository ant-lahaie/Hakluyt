on land , and entering a great way into the country , to see if I could learn any news of Captain Francis Vasquez and his company ; of whom I could have no other knowledge , but such as I learned in the aforesaid River . I bring with me many acts of taking possession of all that Coast . And by the situation of the River , and the height which I took , I find that that which the Master ' s and Pilots of the Marquess took is false , & that they were deceived by 2 degrees , and I have sailed beyond them above 4 degrees . I sailed up He sailed it , the River 8 5 leagues , where I saw and learned all the the particulars before mentioned , and many other things ; ' whereof when it shall please God to give me leave to kiss your Lordship ' s hands , I will deliver you the full and perfect relation . I think my self to have had 317 very good fortune , in that I found DONE Luis de Castilia , The port of and Augustine Ghenero in the port of Colima : for the Colima . Galiot of the Adelantado came upon me , which was there with the rest of his fleet , and commanded me to strike sail , which seeming a strange thing unto me , and not understanding in what state things were in Nueva Espanna , I went about to defend my self , and not to do it . In the mean while came DONE Luis de Castilia in a boat and conferred with me , and I lay at anchor on the other side of the haven where the said fleet road , and I gave unto him this relation ( and to avoid striffe I determined to sail away by night ) which relation I carried about me briefly written ; for I always had a purpose to send the same , as soon as I should touch upon Nueva Espanna , to advertise your Lordship of my proceedings .
