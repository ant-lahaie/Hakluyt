Tripolis , commanding them in no manner whatsoever to deal with our English ships bound into those parts or returning thence with their commodities , although they should shoot one at another : for when our ships shall meet them , for that , as your honour is advertised , the galleys of Carthagena , Florence , Sicilia and Malta have made a league to take all our ships coming in or going out of the Grand Signiors dominions , therefore if they meet with any of these galleys of Alger or Tripolis , thinking they be of them , and not knowing them a far off , they may shoot at them , which if therefore they should make them prizes , were against Gods laws , the Grand Signior his league , all reason and conscience , considering that all the world does know that Merchants ships laden with merchandise do not seek to fight with men of war , but contrariwise to defend themselves from them , when they would do 264 1583 - them harm . Wherefore if your honour do not get out [ II i . 174 . ] two letters of the Grand Signior as aforesaid , & send them hither with all speed by some one of your gentlemen accompanied with a chaus of the Court , or some other of the Grand Signiors servants , it is impossible that our English ships can escape freely from these or the Christians : for either they must of force go on the Christian coast , and so fallen into their hands , or else on this coast , and fallen into the kings of this town , or Tripolis , their hands , which if they should , will never be recovered . And if your honour cannot obtain this thing , I beseech your honour in the behalf of all the English merchants ( who sent me hither to follow such order as your honour should give me ) to certify her Majesty , to the end that they may be commanded to leave off traffic , and not to loose their goods , and her poor subject ' s the Mariners . And thus humbly taking my leave , I desist from troubling your honour . From Algier the tenth of February 1583 .
