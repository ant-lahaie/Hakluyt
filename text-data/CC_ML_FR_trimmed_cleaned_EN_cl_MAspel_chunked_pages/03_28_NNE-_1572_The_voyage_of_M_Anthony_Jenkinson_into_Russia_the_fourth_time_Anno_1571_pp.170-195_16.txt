, without any let or stay . 15 Also it may please his Majesty to understand that during the time of my long being at Colmogro , attending his highness pleasure for my further access , I with my company have not only be ill used and entreated there , and likewise the merchant ' s there , by one Besson Mysserevy his Majesties chief officer , who hath dishonoured me , and smitten my people , and owes the said merchant ' s much money , and will not pay them : but also the said Besson hath spoken words of dishonour against the Queens Majesty . Wherefore it may please his highness to send down with me to Colmogro , a Gentleman , as well chiefly to search forth his evil behaviour towards her Majesty , as towards me her highness Ambassador , and to punish him accordingly : and also that it would please his Majesty to send down his letter of justice , by virtue whereof the said Besson may be forced to pay all such money as he owes to the said merchant ' s , without delay . 16 Also that it would please his highness to understand , that sir William Garrard with his company understanding of the great dearth in his Majesties dominions , by licence of the Queen ' s Majesty , ( not otherwise permitted ) hath sent certain ships laden with corn into his highness Country of Dwyna , rather for the relief of his Majesties subject ' s , then for any gain : yet the good will of the said merchant ' s lightly regarded , they were forbidden to sei the said corn , to their great discouragers meant hereafter to send any more . Wherefore it may please his highness , to tender the good will of the said merchant ' s , as well in sending the said corn , as in all other things , ready to serve his Majesty , and to direct his letters to his officers of Dwina , to suffer the said merchant ' s with their company , to fell the said corn by measure
