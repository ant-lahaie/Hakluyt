friends have written to me : for here are arrived eight weeks past , two boats with wares and Russes , by whom they might have written , had it be but 3 . or 4 . lines . They promised the Russes to write , but promise was not kept . I would be sorry that any boat should depart out of these parts , and not write unto them , weighing how all things stand . I hear they have bought a boat , which cost 40 . rubbles , and shipped certain wares to come hither . God send them in safety . I do tarry their coming , or else I had thought to have come to Astracan in those boats which departed hence lately . The fifteenth of July last , I departed from Casbin , He departed and came to this town the 29 . of you same . And fr Â° m as ^ n the fourth of August I found means to arrest the falsest knave in this country , to for 22 . tumens , and too . shaughs , tumen . ) I have caused him to put forthcoming at all times , what with him , God knoweth , the debt wit , the Customer ( 200 . shaughs is a in sureties for his end I shall have will be recovered , but not yet , for he must pay the Shaugh 1000 . rubbles . These parts as yet are in no stay for lack of a Governor or head to rule , which I think shall be the Mursey . Within 5 . or 6 . days we shall know , for it is time , because men are in fear to travel for being robbed . If there were a prince placed , I should soon get in your debts , for they dare not disobey the Shaughs letters or privilege : wherein he hath not only written that our debts shall be paid , but also that we shall be taken heed to , so as we need not to doubt ( God willing ) in time to come , to be here as well
