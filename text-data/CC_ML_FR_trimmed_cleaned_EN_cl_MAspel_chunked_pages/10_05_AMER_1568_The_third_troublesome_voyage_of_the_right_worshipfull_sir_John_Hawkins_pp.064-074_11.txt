we could by no means repair aboard our ship : the ship also was in such peril that every hour we looked for shipwreck . But yet God again had mercy on us , and sent fair weather , we had aboard our water , and departed the sixteenth day of October , after which day we had fair and prosperous weather till the sixteenth day of November , which day God be praised we were clear from the coast of the Indies , and out of the channel and gulf of Bahama , which is between the Cape of Florida , and the Islands of Lucayo . After this growing near to the cold country , our men being oppressed with famine , died continually , and they that were left , grew into such weakness that we were scantly able to manage our ship , and the wind being always ill for us to recover England , we determined to go with Galicia in Spaine , with intent there to relieve our company and other extreme wants . And being arrived the last day of December in a place near unto Vigo called Ponte Vedra , our men with excess of fresh meat grew into miserable diseases , and died a great part of them . This matter was born out as long as it might be , but in the end although there were none of our men suffered to go a land , yet by access of the Spaniards , our feebleness was known to them . Whereupon they ceased not to seek by all means to betray us , but with all speed possible we departed to Vigo , where we had some help of certain English ships and twelve fresh men , wherewith we repaired our wants as we might , and departing the 20 day of January 1568 arrived in Mounts bay in Cornewall the 25 of the same month , praised be God therefore . If all the misery ' s and troublesome affairs of this sorrowful voyage should be perfectly and thoroughly written , there should need a painful man with his pen , and as great a time as he had that wrote the lives and deaths of the Martyrs .
