jn the world , as I suppose , that live so the poor . miserably as do the poverty in those parts : and the most part of them that have sufficient for themselves , and also to relieve others that need , are so unmerciful that they care not how many they see die of famine or hunger in the streets . Stows or It is a country full of diseases , diverse , and evil , baths usual and the best remedy is for any of them , as they hold with the opinion , to go often unto the hight houses , as in a manner every man hath one or his own , which he heateth commonly twice every week , and all the household sweat , and wash themselves therein . Reported by Thomas Bulky . The names of certain sorts of drinks used in Russia , and commonly drunk in the Emperors Court . THe first and principali mead is made of the juice or liccour taken from a berry called in Russia , Malieno , which is of a marvelous sweet taste , and of a carmosant colour , which berry I have seen in Paris . The second mead is called Visnova , because it is made of a berry so called , and is like a black gooseberry : but it is like in colour and taste to the read wine of France . The third mead is called Amarodina or Smorodina , short , of a small berry much like to the small rezin , and grows in great plenty in Russia . The fourth mead is called Cherevnikyna , which is made of the wild black cherry . 448 The fift mead is made of honey and water , with other mixtures . There is also a delicate drink drawn from the root of the birch tree , called in the Russe tongue Berozevites , which drink the noble men and others use in Aprill , May , and June , which are the three months of the spring time : for after those months , the sap of the tree drieth , and then they cannot have it .
