more you have , the more contrary shall you find them . For my part , albeit I have probable conjectures persuading me not to believe any of the former opinions , concerning the situation of Island , but to dissent from them all : yet had I rather leave the matter in suspense then affirm and uncertainty , until ( as I have said ) I may be able perhaps one day not to guess at the matter , but to bring forth mine own observation , and experience .
