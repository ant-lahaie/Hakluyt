of threescore good and tall warlike ships , with twentie smaller ред barks , and those 80 . ships ( great and small ) with 6660 . apt men furnished , and all singularly well appointed for service both on sea and land , faithfully and diligently to be done in such circumspect and discreet order , as partly I have in other places declared , and further ( upon good occasion offered ) may declare . This grand navy of peaceable king Edgar , of so many thousand ships , and they furnished with and hundred thousand men at the least , with all the final intents of those sea forces , so invincible , continually maintained , the order of the execution of their service , the godly and Imperial success thereof , are in a manner kingly lessons and prophetical encouragements to us left , even now to be as provident for public security as he was , to be as skilful of our sea right and royal limits , and wisely to find our selves as able to recover and enjoy the same as he was , who could not choose , but with the passing and yearly sailing about this British Albion , with all the lesser Isles next adjacent round about it , he could not choose I say , but by such full and peaceable possession , find himself ( according to right , and his hearts desire ) the true and sovereign Monarch of all the British Ocean , environing any way his empire of Albion and Ireland , with the lesser Islands next adjacent : with memorial whereof , as witone very precious jewel Imperial , he adorned the title and crown of his regality , as with the testimony annexed of the states and nobles of his Empire , to commit to perpetuali memory , the style of his chief worldly dignity , in this very tenor of words before also remembered . Ego TEdgarus Anglorum Basileus , omniumque Regum , Insularum , Oceanique Britanniam circumjacentis , cunctardmque nationum , quae infra eam includuntur , Imperator , & Dominus . Note the Queens Majesties royalty over the British Ocean sea , round about the British Empire .
