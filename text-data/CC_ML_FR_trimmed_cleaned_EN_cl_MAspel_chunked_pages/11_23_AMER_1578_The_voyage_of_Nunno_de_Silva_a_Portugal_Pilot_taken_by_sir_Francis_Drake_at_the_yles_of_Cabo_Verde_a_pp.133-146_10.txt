ship it was : whereupon one of the Spanish prisoners ( by the English Captains commandment ) answered and said it was the ship of Michael Angelo , that came from Chili : which they of the boat hearing sent a man on board , who climbing up , light upon one of the great pieces , wherewith he was afraid , and presently stepped back again into the boat ( because the ships that lay there , and that sailed in those countries ' , used to carry no great shot ) and therewith they were abashed , and made from it : which the ship of Panama hearing , that was newly come in , she judged it to be a rover , and therewith cutting her cables , she put to sea , which the Englishmen perceiving , shipped certain men in their pinnace , and followed her : and being hard by her , they bad her strike , which they of the ship refused to do , and with a harquebus shot 142 killed one of the Englishmen , wherewith they turned again into their ship , and presently set sail , following after the ship , which not long after they overtook : which they of the ship perceiving hoised out their boat , and leaping into it , rowed to the land , leaving the ship with all the goods , which the Englishmen presently took , and with her sailed on their course . The next day they saw a boat with sails making towards them , whereby they presently mistrusted it to be a spy , and not long after they perceived two great ships coming towards them , which made the English think they came to fight with them , whereupon they let the ship of Panama drive , therein leaving John the Greek , with the two men that they had taken the same day that they entered into the Calao de Lyma , as I said before , and presently hoised all their sails , and sailed forward , not once setting eye again upon the aforesaid ships , for they made towards the ship of Panama , which the Englishmen let drive . From thence they sailed again
