the men was drowned , which the people lamented , and cried so soar , that we might easily hear them , and they god his body out of the sea , and carried it among them to their town . The 14 day we came within Saker - shot of the castle , & straightway they set forth and Almade to descry us , and when they perceived that we were no Portugals , they ran within the town again : for there is a great town by the Castle which is called by the Negroes Dondou . Without this there lie two great rocks like Hands , and the castle stands upon a point which shows almost like and Hand . Before we came at this castle , we found the land for five or six leagues to be high land , and about seven leagues before we came to the castle , low land , until we came at the castle , and then we found the land high again . This castle stands about five leagues to the East of Cape de Tres puntas . Here I took the boat with our Negroes and ran alongst the shore till I came to the Cape 216 1557 - and found two small towns , but no boats at them , neither any traffic to be had . At these places our Negroes did understand them well , and one of them went a shore at all the places and was well received of them . This night we anchored at the Cape de Tres puntas . The 15 day I took our boat and went along the shore , & about 3 leagues beyond the Eastermost part of the Cape we found a fair Bay where we ran in , and found a small town and certain boats which belonged to the same town , but the Negroes in a long time would not come to us , but at the last by the persuasion of our own Negroes , one boat came to us , and with him we sent George our Negro a shore , and after he had talked with them , they came aboard our boats
