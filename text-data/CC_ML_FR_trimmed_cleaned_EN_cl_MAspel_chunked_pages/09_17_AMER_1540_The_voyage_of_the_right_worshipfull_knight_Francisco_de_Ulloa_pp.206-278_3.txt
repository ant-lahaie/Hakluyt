, and found very pleasant plains , and certain great lake ' s whose Certainegreat mouths opened into the Sea : here our Captain thought la ^ es ' good thoroughly to discover what those lake ' s were , and to search whither there were any good haven for his ships to ride in , or to harbour themselves , if any tempest should arise ; and so he commanded a boat to be hoist out into the Sea , with a Master and five or sixe men to view them , and to found the depth , and bottom of them : who went thither , and found the coast very should , and the mouths of the lake ' s ; whereupon they made no account of them , only because the shore was so shallow , for otherwise the land was very pleasant . Here at evening we saw on the shore 10 . or 12 . Indians and fires . The aforesaid two Rivers are two leagues distant the one from the other little more or less , and are great , as I have said , and being in the last of them we went up to the ship - top , and saw many lake ' s , and one among the rest exceeding great , and we supposed that they had their springs out of this great lake , as other Rivers also have from other lake ' s , for we saw the course of them severally each by themselves , having goodly woods growing all along their banks . The currents of these Rivers might be discerned three leagues within the Sea : and at the mouths of them were many small stakes set up for marks : the shore here is plain and sandy , and the country very pleasant .
