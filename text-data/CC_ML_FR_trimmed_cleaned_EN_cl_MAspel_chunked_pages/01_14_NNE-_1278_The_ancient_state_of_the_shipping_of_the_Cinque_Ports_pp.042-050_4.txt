says further , that Rumney and Sandwich answered the like service . But now whither this ( like ) ought to be understood of the like altogether , both in respect of the number and service , or of thee ( like ) in respect of service , according to the proportion of their ability only , I may not hereby take upon me to determine . For on the one side , if Rumney , Sandwich , and the residue , should likewise find twentie vessels a piece , then ( as you shall anon see ) the five Ports were subject to a greater charge at that time , then King Edward the first laid upon them : And on the other side , if they were only chargeable after their proportion , then know I not how far to burden them , seeing the Record of Domesday it self , binds them to no certainty . And therefore leaving this as I find it , I must elsewhere make inquisition for more lightsome proof . And first I will have recourse to king Edward the first his Chartre in which I read , that At each time that the King passes over the sea , the Ports ought to rig up fiftie and seven ships , ( whereof every one to have twentie armed soldiers ) and to maintain them at their own costs , by the space of fifteene days together . And thus it stood with the Ports for their generail > 278 - charge , in the sixt year of his reign , for then was this Chartre sealed . But as touching the particular burden of each one , I have seen two diverse testimonies , of which the first is a note in French ( bearing the countenance of a Record ) and is entitled , to have be renewed in the two and twentie year of the Reign of the same king , by Stephan Penchester , then Constable of Dover Castle , in which the particular charge is set down in this manner . The Port of Hastings ought to find three ships . The lowy of Pevensey , one . Bulverhithe and Petit Jahn , one . Bekesborne in Kent , seven
