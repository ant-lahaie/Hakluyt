in more fear of us . This was all the answer for this time we could have of our men , or of our Generals letter . Their crafty dealing at these three several times being thus manifest unto us , may plainly show their disposition in other things to be correspondent . We judged that they used 223 these stratagems , thereby to have caught some of us , for the delivering of the man , woman and child whom we had taken . They are men of a large corporature , and good proportion : their colour is not much unlike the Sun burned Country man , who laboureth daily in the Sun for his living . They wear their hair something long , and cut before either with stone or knife , very disorderly . Their women wear their hair long , and knit up with two loupes , showing forth on either side of their faces , and the rest foltred upon a knot . Also some of their women raze their faces proportionally , as chin , cheeks , and forehead , and the wrists of their hands , whereupon they lay a colour which continueth dark azurine . They eat their meat all raw , both flesh , fish , and foul , or something per boiled with blood and a little water which they drink . For lack of water they will eat ice , that is hard frozen , as pleasantly as we will do Sugar Candie , or other Sugar . If they for necessities sake stand in need of the premises , such grass as the Country yields they pluck up and eat , not deintily , or salletwise to allure their stomachs to appetite : but for necessities sake without either salt , oils or washing , like brutus beasts devouring the same . They neither use table , stool , or table cloth for comeliness : but when they are imbrued with blood knuckle deep , and their knives in like sort , they use their tongues as apt instruments to lick them clean : in doing whereof they are assured to lose none of their victuals .
