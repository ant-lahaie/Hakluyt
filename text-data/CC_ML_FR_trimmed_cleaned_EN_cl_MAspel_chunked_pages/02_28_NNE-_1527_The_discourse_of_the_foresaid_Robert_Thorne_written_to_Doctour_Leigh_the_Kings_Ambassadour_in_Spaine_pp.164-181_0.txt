The book made by the right worshipful M . Robert Thorn in the year 1527 . in Sivil , to Doctor Ley , Lord ambassador for king Henry the eight , to Charles the Emperor , being and information of the parts of the world , discovered by him and the king of Portingal : and also of the way to the Molucca ' s by the North . Right noble and reverend in etc . I have received your letters , and have procured and sent to know of your servant , who , your Lordship wrote , should be sick in Merchena . I cannot there or else where hear of him , without he be returned to you , or gone to S . Lucar , and shipped . I cannot judge but that of some contagious sickness he died , so that the owner of the house for defaming his house would bury him secretly , and not be known of it . For such things have often times happened in this country . Also to write unto your Lordship of the new trade of Spicery of the Emperor , there is no doubt but that the Islands are fertile of Cloves , Nutmegs , Mace , and Cinnamom : and that the said Islands , with other there about , abound with gold , Rubies , Diamonds , Balasses , Granates , Jacincts , and other stones & pearls , as all other lands , that are under and near the Equinoctial . For we see , where nature gives any thing , she is no niggard . For as with us and other , that are aparted from the said Equinoctial , our metals be Led , Tin , and Iron , so theirs be Gold , Silver , and Copper . And as our fruits and grains be Apples , Nuts , and Corn , so theirs be Dates , Nutmegs , Pepper , Cloves , and other Spices . And as we have Jeat , Amber , Crystal , Jasper , and other like stones , so have they Rubies , Diamonds , 164 Balasses , Sapphires , Jacincts ,
