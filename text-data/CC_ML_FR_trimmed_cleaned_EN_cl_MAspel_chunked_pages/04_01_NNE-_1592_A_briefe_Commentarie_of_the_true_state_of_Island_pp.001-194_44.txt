There do burst out of the same hill Hecla two fountains , the one whereof , by reason of the cold streams , the other with intolerable heat exceeds all the force of elements . These be Frisius his two first fountains , saving that here is omitted the miracle of hardening bodies , being by him attributed to one of the said fountains . But they cannot at one time break forth , both out of the mountain it self , and near unto the mountain .
