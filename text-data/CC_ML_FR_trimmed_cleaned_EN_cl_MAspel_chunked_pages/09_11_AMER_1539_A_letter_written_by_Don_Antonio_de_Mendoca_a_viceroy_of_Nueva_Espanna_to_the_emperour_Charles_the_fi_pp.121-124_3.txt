the same . After these days he sent them home again , willing them not to be afraid , but to be quiet , giving them apparel , beads , knives , and other such like things , which I had given him for such purposes . The said Indians departed very well pleased , and said , that whensoever he would send for them , they and many others would come to do whatsoever he would command them . The entrance being thus prepared , Friar Marco and his companion , with the Negro and other slaves , and Indians which I had given him , went forward on their voyage io . or 12 . days after . And because I had likewise advertisement of a certain Province called Topira situate in the mountains , and had appointed the governor Vazquez de Coronado , that he should use means to learn the state thereof ; he supposing this to be a matter of great moment , determined himself to go and search it , having agreed with the said Friar , that he should return by that part of the mountain , to meet with him in a certain valley called Valle de los Corazones , being 120 . leagues distant from Culiacan . The governor traveling into this province ( as I have written in my former letters ) found great scarcity of victuals there , and the mountains so craggy , that he could find no way to pass forward , and was enforced to return home to Saint Michael : so that aswell in choosing of the entrance , as in not being able to find the way , it seems unto all men , that God would shut up the gate to all those , which by strength of humane force have gone about to attempt this enterprise , and hath revealed it to a poor and barefooted Friar . And so the Friar began to enter into the Land , who because he found his entrance so well prepared , was very well received ; and because he wrote the whole success of his voyage , according to the instruction which I had given him to undertake the same , I will not write any more at large , but send your Majesty this copy of all such things as he observed in the same .
