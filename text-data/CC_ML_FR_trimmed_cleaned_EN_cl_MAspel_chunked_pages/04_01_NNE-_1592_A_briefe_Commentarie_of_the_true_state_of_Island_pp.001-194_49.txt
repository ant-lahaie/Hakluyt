seeming to be very hight is most extremely could , etc . The third is sweeter than honey . Neither is this altogether true . For there is not any fountain with us , which may in the least respect be compared with the sweetness of honey . And therefore Saxon wrote more 132 1592 . truly , saying , that certain fountains ( for there be very many ) yielding taste as good as beer : and also in the same place there are fountains & rivers not only of diverse tastes , but of diverse colours . And albeit natural Philosophers teach , that water naturally of it self hath neither taste nor smel , yet it is likely ( as we have touched before , which other call per accidens ) that oftentimes it representeth the qualities of that earth wherein it is engendered , and through the veins whereof it hath passage and issue : and from hence proceed the diverse & sundry smells , colours and savours of all waters . Of such waters doth Seneca make mention , whereof some provoke hunger , others make men drunken , some hurt the memory , & some help it , & some resemble the very quality and taste of wine , as that fountain which Plinie speaks of in the He of I ‚Äù Andros , within the temple of Bachus , which in the mtrab - auscult - Nones of January used to flow over with wine . And Aristotle reporteth , that in the field of Carthage there is a fountain which yields oil , & certain drops smelling like Cedar . Also Orcus a river of Thessalie flowing into Peneus , swimmeth aloft like oil . Cardane reporteth , that there is in Saxonie , near unto the town of Bruns - wic , a fountain mixed with oil : and another in Suevia near unto the Abbey called Tergensch . Also in the valley of the mountain Jurassus . He supposeth the cause of this thing to be very fatty pitch , which cannot but contain oil in it . The same author
