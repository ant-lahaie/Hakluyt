Use of money they have none , but doe barter their cattle for apparel and other necessaries . They delight in no art nor science , except the wars , wherein they are expert , but for the most part they be pasturing people , and have great store of cattle , which is all their riches . They eat much flesh , and especially the horse , and they drink mares milk , wherewith they be oftentimes drunk : they are seditious & inclined to theft and murder . Corn they sow not , neither do eat any bred , mocking the Christians for the same , and disabling our strengths , saying we live by eating the top of a weed , and drink a drink made of the same , allowing their great devouring of flesh , and drinking of milk to be the increase of their strength .
