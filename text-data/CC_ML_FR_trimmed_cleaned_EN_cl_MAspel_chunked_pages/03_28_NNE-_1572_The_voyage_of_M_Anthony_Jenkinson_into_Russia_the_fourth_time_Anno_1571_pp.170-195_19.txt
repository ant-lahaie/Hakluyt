sister had not sent thee Anthony unto us at this present , God knoweth what we should have done to the said 187 A . D . 1572 . The causes of the Emperor ' s displeasure . merchant ' s , or whither we would have called back our indignation . Then I humbly beseeched his Majesty , to let me know the particular offences committed by the said merchant ' s , and the offenders names , to the intent I might make report thereof , unto the Queens Majesty , my mistress , accordingly , that the said offenders might receive just punishments for their deserts : but he said , I should not know them , because he had clearly remitted all offences : and further , that it was not princely to forgive , and after to accuse the parties , whereby her Majesties displeasure might fallen upon them at home . Notwithstanding I did after understand some part thereof , by other means . Then his Majesty proceeding in talk , said : As touching the articles of request , concerning the merchants affairs , which you did yesterday deliver unto our Secretary , we have not only read the same our self , but also have appointed our said Secretary to declare unto you our mind , and answer to the same . And for that we are now upon our journey towards our borders , and will depart from hence shortly , we will dismiss you to the Queen our loving sister , your mistress , with our letters , & full mind by word of mouth , touching all your requests , & will send a gentleman one of our household with you to safe conduct you to your ships : and of our goodness will give you victuals , boats , men , and post horses , so many as you shall need . And therewith his Majesty standing up , and putting off his cap , said unto me these words . Do our hearty commendations unto our loving sister , Queen Elizabeth , unto whom we wish long life , with happy success :
