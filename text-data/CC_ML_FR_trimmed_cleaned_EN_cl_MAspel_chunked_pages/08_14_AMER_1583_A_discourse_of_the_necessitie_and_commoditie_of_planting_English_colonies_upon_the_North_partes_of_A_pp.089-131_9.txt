attained without any great danger or difficulty . And lastly , ( which is most of all ) A thing likewise tending to the honour and glory of Almighty God . And for that the lawfulness to plant in those Countries in some men ' s judgements seems very doubtful , I will begin the proof of the lawfulness of trade , traffic , and planting . The second Chapter shows , that it is lawful and necessary to trade and traffic with the Savages : And to plant in their Countries : And divides planting into two sorts . A Nd first for traffic , I say that the Christians may lawfully travel into those Countries and abide there : whom the Savages may not justly impugn and forbid in respect of the mutual society and fellowship between man and man prescribed by the Law of Nations . For from the first beginning of the creation of the world , and from the renewing of the same after Noes flood , all men have agreed , that no violence should be offered to Ambassadors : That the Sea with his Havens should be common : That such as should fortune to be taken in war , should be servants or slaves : And that strangers should not be driven away from the place or Country whereunto they do come . If it were so then , I demand in what age , and by what Law is the same forbidden or denied since ? For who doubteth but that it is lawful for Christians to use trade and traffic with Infidels or Savages , carrying thither such commodities as they want , and bringing from thence some part of their plenty ? A thing so commonly and generally practised , both in these our days , and in times past , beyond the memory of man , both by Christians and Infidels , that it needs no further proof . vni 97 g The principali causes why this voyage is undertaken .
