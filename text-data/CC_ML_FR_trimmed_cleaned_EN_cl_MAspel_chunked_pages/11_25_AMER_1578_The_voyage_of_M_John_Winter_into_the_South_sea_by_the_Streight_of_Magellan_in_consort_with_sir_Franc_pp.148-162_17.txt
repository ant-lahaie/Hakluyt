showed unto us by signs , that the Portugals were coming with their canoas to take us , as it fell out in deed : for the next morning they showed themselves with 12 or 16 canoas , some of them having 40 men in them . The same night two of our men ran away with our boat to the Portugals . And thus we came away from thence towards our own country the 17 of March : and had sighed of the Cape of sant Augustine , lying in 8 degrees to the Southward of the line . After that we had sighed of and island lying within 3 degrees of the Equinoctial , called the isle of Fernando de Loronha . We crossed the Equinoctial the 13 of April , and had sighed of the North star the 19 of the said month . The 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 of May , we sailed through the sea of Weeds , about the space of 100 leagues , being under the Tropicke of Cancer . From whence we kept our course towards the Northeast , until we had the pole raised 47 degrees . The 22 of May we ran Eastnortheast . The 29 we sounded and had 70 fathoms with white oaze ; having the North pole raised 51 degrees . The 30 of May we had sighed of S . Ives on the North side of Cornwall , and the 2 of June 1579 we arrived at Ilfoord - combe in Devonshire . And thus after our manifold troubles and great dangers in having passed The straights of Magellan into the South Sea with our general M . Francis Drake , and having be driven with him down to the Southerly latitude of 57 degrees , and afterwards passing back by the same straights again , it pleased God to bring us safe into our own native country to enjoy the presence of our deer friends and kinsfolks , to whom be praise , honour , and glory , for ever and ever . Amen . Edward Cliff , Mariner .
