a little , he prepared himself to war , and went forth against the people called Huyri : These men were Chris - Letters . tians of the sect of Nestorius . And these also the Mongals overcame , and received letters or learning from them : for before that time they had not the art of writing , and now they call it the hand or letters of the Mongals . Immediately after , he marched against the country of Saruyur , and of the Karanites , and against the land of Hudirat ; all which he vanquished . Then returned he home into his own country , and breathed himself . Afterwards , assembling his warlike troops , they marched with one accord against the Kythayans , and waging war with them a long time , they conquered a great part of their land , and shut up their Emperor into his greatest city : which city they had so long time besieged , that they began to want necessary provision for their 144 army . And when they had no victuals to feed upon , Chingis Cham commanded his soldiers , that they should eat every tenth man of the company . But they of the city fought manfully against them , with engines , darts , and arrows , and when stones wanted they threw silver , and especially melted silver : for the same city abounded with great riches . Also , when the Mongals had fought a long time and could not prevail by war , they made a great trench underneath the ground from the army unto the midst of the city , and there issuing forth they fought against the citizens , and the remnant also without the walls fought in like manner . At last , breaking open the gates of the city , they entered , and putting the Emperor , with many other to the sword , they took possession thereof and conveyed away the gold , silver , and all the riches therein . And having appointed certain deputies over the country , they returned home into their own land .
