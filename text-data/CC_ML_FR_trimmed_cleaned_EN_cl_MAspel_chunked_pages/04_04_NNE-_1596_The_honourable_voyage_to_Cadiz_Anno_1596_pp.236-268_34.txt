minded man . But yet if any will needs desire to be a little farther satisfied , albeit it need not , yet then , thus much I dare say and affirm , that upon my knowledge , the chiefest cause why Port Saint Marry , and the rest were left untouched , was this : For that it was most certainly known , that they were towns not worth the saluting of such a royal company , in which there was no manner of wealth in the world left , more then bore houses of stone , and standing walls , and might well have served rather as a stale , perchance , to have entrapped , then as a means to have enriched . And it had been more then a suspicion of folly , for such and army as this , to have sought to fight with the air , and to have laboured with great pain and charges , yea , and with 267 A . D . I596 . some evident danger too , to have overthrown that , which could very little or nothing have profited , being destroyed : and yet now , can do as little harm being left , as it is , untouched . And thus much for our journey to Cadiz : for the accidents that happened by the way , for the winning , spoiling , and burning of the said town , for the overthrow of the Spanish Fleet there , and for all other by - matters that happened , as appendances to the same , both in the time of our abided there , as also at the very last hour of our coming from thence . As for our return home , and our entrance into a part of Portingal by the way , with the taking , spoiling , and burning of the town of Faraon there , and marching into the Spanish confines thereabouts , etc . I mind to leave it to some other , whose chance was to be present at the actium , as my self was not , and shall of more sufficient ability to perform it .
