follows presently . In the year of our Lord God 1567 , for the ill success that the people of Bezeneger had , in that their City was sacked by the foure kings , the king with his Court went to dwell in a castle eight days journey up in the land from Bezeneger , called Penegonde . Also sixe days journey from Bezeneger , is the place where they get Diamonds : I was not there , but it was told me that it is a great place , compassed with a wall , and that they fell the earth within the wall , for so much a squadron , and the limits are set how deep or how low they shall dig . Those Diamonds that are of a certain 386 size and bigger then that size , are all for the king , it is many years ago , since they god any there , for the troubles that have been in that kingdom . The first cause of this trouble was , because the son of this Temeragio had put to death the lawful king which he had in prison , for which cause the Barons and Noblemen in that kingdom would not acknowledge him to be their King , and by this means there are many kings , and great division in that kingdom , and the city of Bezeneger is not altogether destroyed , yet the houses stand still , but empty , and there is dwelling in them nothing , as is reported , but Tigers and other wild beasts . The circuit of this city is foure & twentie miles about , and within the walls are certain mountains . The houses stand walled with earth , and plain , all saving the three palaces of the three tyrant brothers , and the Pagodas which are idol houses : these are made with lime and fine marble . I have seen many kings Courts , and yet have I seen none in greatness like to this of Bezeneger , I say , for the order of his palace , for it hath nine gates
