at the sea can make just proof of the profit in them : so necessarily dependeth art and reason upon practice and experience . Albeit there are diverse both learned and unlearned , little or nothing experienced , which in talk of navigation will enter deeply and speak much of and against errors used therein , when they cannot reform them . Such also have written thereof , pretending singular great knowledge therein , and would so be accounted of , though in very deed not worthy the name of good and sufficient pilots . To whom I think it shall not be amiss in defence of rules budded upon reason , and in practice allowed , thus much to say for answer . It is so , that there are rules used in navigation which are not perfectly true : among which the straight lines in sea - cardes , representing the 32 . points of the compass or winds , are not held to be the least , but noted of such talkers for principali , to condemn the occupiers thereof for ignorant : yet hath the famous and learned Gerardus Mercator used them in his universal map . But such as condemn them for false , and speak most against their use cannot give other that should serve for navigation to better purpose and effect . Experience ( one of the keys of knowledge ) hath taught me to say it . Wherein with my ability , together with some part of my study , I am the rather moved ( in this my plot ) to make some trial unto your majesty : for that 211 I perceive that such attempts of new discoveries ( whereunto this noble Island is most aptly situated ) are by your royal maintenance so willingly furthered : beseeching your highness so to accept of these my travails , as a pledge of my well willing to my country , and of my loyal service to your majesty , whose healthful happy life and reign God continue which is Almighty . Amen . Your Majesties most humble subject William Burrough .
