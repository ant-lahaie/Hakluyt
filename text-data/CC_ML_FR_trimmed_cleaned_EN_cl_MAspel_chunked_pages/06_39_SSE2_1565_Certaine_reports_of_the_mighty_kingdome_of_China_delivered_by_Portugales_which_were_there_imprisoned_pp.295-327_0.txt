Done out of Italian into English by Richard Wills . His land of China is parted into 13 . Shires , the which sometime were each one a kingdom by it self , but these many years they have be all subject unto one King . Fuquien is made by the Fuquien . Portugals the first Shire , because there their troubles began , & they had occasion thereby to know the rest . In this shire be 8 . cities , but one principally more famous then others called Fuquieo , the other seven are reasonably great , the best known whereof unto the Portugals is Cinceo , in respect of a Cinceo . certain haven joining thereunto , whither in time passed they were wont for merchandise to resort . Cantan is the second shire , not so great in quantity , Cantan . as well accounted of , both by the king thereof , and also by the Portugals , for that it lies nearer unto Malacca then any other part of China , and was first descried by the Portugals before any other shire in that province : this shire hath in it seven Cities . Chequeam is the third shire , the chiefest City therein Chequeam . is Donchion , therein also stands Liampo , with other 13 . or 14 . boroughs : country towns therein are too too many to be spoken of .
