taken from our men , be restored unto this my Secretary freely , without delay , as the Grand Signior of his goodness hath granted 318 unto us , especially in regard that the same oils were bought by the commandment of our Queens most excellent Majesty , for the provision of her Court . Which if you perform not , we protest by these our letters against you , that you are the cause of all the inconveniences which may ensue upon this occasion , as the author thereof , contrary to the holy league sworn by both our Princes , as by the privileges , which this our servant will show you , may appear . For the seeing of which league performed , we remain here as Ligier in this stately Court . And by this means you shall answer in another world unto God alone , and in this world unto the Grand Signior , for this heinous sin committed by you against so many poor souls , which by this your cruelty are in part dead , and in part detained by you in most miserable captivity . Contrariwise , if it shall please you to avoid this mischief , and to remain in the favour of Almighty God , and of our Princes , you shall friendly fulfil this our just demand ( as it behooveth you to show your self a prudent Governor , and faitbfull servant unto your Lord ) and the same may turn to your great honour , and profit , by the trade of merchandise , which our men in time to come , may use in that government of yours : which generally , as well those poor men , as all others , which you shall meet at the sea , ought to be according to the commandment of the Grand Signior , friendly entertained and received of your honourable Lordship , and we will not fade in the duties of a speciali friend , whensoever you shall have occasion to use us , as we desire . Almighty God grant unto your Lordship ( in the fulfilling of this our just request , whereby we may be delivered from further trouble in this matter , and your self from further displeasure ) all true felicity , and increase of honour . Given in our Palace from Rapamat in Pera , the 15 . of Januarie 1585 .
