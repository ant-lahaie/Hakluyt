, to loose at one blow our chief ship freighted with great provision , 66 1583 gathered together with much travel , care , long time , and difficulty . But more was the loss of our men , which perished to the number almost of a hundreth souls . among whom was drowned a learned man , and Hun - Stephanus garian , born in the city of Buda , called thereof Budaeus , Parmeni ™ a who of piety and zeal to good attempts , adventured in sar - tan . this actium , minding to record in the Latin tongue , the gests and things worthy of remembrance , happening in this discovery , to the honour of our nation , the same being adorned with the eloquent style of this Orator , and rare Poet of our time . Here also perished our Saxon Refiner and Discoverer Daniel a of inestimable riches , as it was left among some of us nfiwof • j i j 1 ° metals . in undoubted hope . No less heavy was the loss of the Captain Maurice brown , a virtuous , honest , and discreet Gentleman , overseen only in liberty given late before to men , that ought to have be restrained , who showed himself a man resolved , and never unprepared for death , as by his last act of this tragedy appeared , by report of them that escaped this wrack miraculously , as shall be hereafter declared . For when all hope was passed of recovering the ship , and that men began to give over , and to save themselves , the Captain was advised before to shift also for his life , by the Pinnace at the stern of the ship : but refusing that counsel , he would not give example with the first to leave the ship , but used all means to exhort his people not to despair , nor so to leave off their labour , choosing rather to die , then to incur infamy , by forsaking his charge , which then might be thought to have perished through his default , showing and ill president unto his men , by leaving the ship first himself .
