for the servants , and a sumptuous banquet was brought in served by us all in plate , with the found of trumpets , and consort of music , wherewith the Spaniards were more then delighted . Which banquet being ended , the Spaniardes in recompense of our courtesy , caused a great herd of white bulls , and kine to be brought together from the mountains , and appointed for every Gentleman and Captain that would ride , a horse ready saddled , and then singled out three of the best of them to be hunted by horsemen after their manner , so that the pastime grew very pleasant for the space of three hours , wherein all three of the beasts were killed , whereof one took the Sea , and there was slain with a musket . After this sport , many rare presents and gifts were given and bestowed on both parts , and the next day we played the Merchants in bargaining with them by way of truck and exchange of diverse of their commodities , as horses , mares , kine , bulls , goats , swine , sheep , bullhides , sugar , ginger , pearl , tobacco , and such like commodities of the Hand . The 7 . day we departed with great good will from the Spaniards from the Hand of Hispaniola : but the wiser sort do impute this great show of friendship , and courtesy used towards us by the Spaniards rather to the 314 force that we were of , and the vigilancy , and watchful - ness that was among us , then to any hearty good will , or sure friendly entertainment : for doubtless if they had be stronger then we , we might have looked for no better courtesy at their hands , then Master John Haukins received at Saint John de Ullua , or John Oxnam near the straights of Dariene , and diverse others of our Countrymen in other places . The 8 . day we anchored at a small Hand to take Seals , which in that place we understood to have be in great quantity , where the general and certain others with him in the pinnace were in very great danger to have been all cast away
