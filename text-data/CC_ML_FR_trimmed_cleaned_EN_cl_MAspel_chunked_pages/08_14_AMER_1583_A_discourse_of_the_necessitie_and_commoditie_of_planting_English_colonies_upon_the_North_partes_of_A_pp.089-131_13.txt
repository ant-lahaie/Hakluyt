in withstanding them afterwards to enjoy the rights for which both painfully and lawfully they have adventured themselves thither : Then in such a case I hold it no breach of equity for the Christians to defend themselves , to pursue revenge with force , and to do whatsoever is necessary for the attaining of their safety : For it is allowable by all Laws in such distresses , to resist violence with violence : And 100 for their more security to increase their strength by building of Forts for avoiding the extremity of injurious dealing . Wherein if also they shall not be suffered in reasonable quietness to continue , there is no bar ( as I judge ) but that in stout assemblies the Christians may issue out , and by strong hand pursue their enemies , subdue them , take possession of their Towns , Cities , or Villages , and ( in avoiding murderous tyrannic ) to use the Law of Arms , as in like case among all Nations at this day is used : and most especially to the end they may with security hold their lawful possession , lest happily after the departure of the Christians , such Savages as have be converted , should afterwards through compulsion and enforcement of their wicked Rulers , return to their horrible idolatry ( as did the children of Israel , after the decease of Joshua ) and continue their wicked custom of most unnatural sacrificing of humane creatures . And in so doing , doubtless the Christians shall no whit at all transgress the bonds of equity or civility , forasmuch as in former ages , ( yea , before the incarnation of Christ ) the like hath be done by sundry Kings and Princes , Governors of the children of Israel : chiefly in respect to begin their planting , for the establishment of Gods word : as also since the Nativity of Christ , mighty and puissant Emperors and Kings have performed the like , I say to plant , possess , and subdue . For proof whereof , I will allege you examples of both kinds
