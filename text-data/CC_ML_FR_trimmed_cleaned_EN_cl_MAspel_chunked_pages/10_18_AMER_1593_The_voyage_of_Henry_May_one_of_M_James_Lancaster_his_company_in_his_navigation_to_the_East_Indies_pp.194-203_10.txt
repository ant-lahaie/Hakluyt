barren : but it yields great store of fowl , fish and tortoises . And to the Eastward of the Island are very good harbours , so that a ship of 200 tun may ride there landlocked , without any danger , with water enough . Also in this Island is as good fishing for pearls as is any in the West Indies , but that the place is subject to foul weather , as thundering , lightning and rain : but in April and part of May we had very fair and hight weather . The 11 of May it pleased God to set us clear of the Island , to the no little joy of us all , after we had lived in the same almost the space of 5 months . And the 20 of May we fell with the land never to Cape Briton , where we ran into a fresh water river , whereof there be many , and took in wood , water , and ballast . And here the people of the country came unto us , being clothed all in furs , with the furred side unto their skins , & brought with them furs of sundry sorts to fell , beside great store of wild ducks : so some of our company having saved some small beads , bought 202 some of their ducks . Here we stayed not above foure hours , and so departed . This should seem to be a very good country . And we saw very fine champion ground , and woods . From this place we ran for the bank of Newfoundland , whereas we met with diverse , but none would take in a man of us , until it pleased God that we met with a bark of Falmouth , which received us all for a little time ; and with her we took a French ship , wherein I left capitan de la Barbotier my deer friend , and all his company , and stayed my self aboard the English bark : and having passage in the same , in the month of August I arrived at Falmouth 1594 .
