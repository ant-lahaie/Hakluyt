and break ; or by keeping him in his towns leave us a spoiled field : where though our provision may be such of our own as we starve not , yet is our weakness in any strange country such , as with sickness and misery we shall be dissolved . And let him not forget what a continual burden we hereby lay upon us , in that to repossess those countries ' which have been lately lost , will be a war of longer continuance then we shall be able to endure . In the very actium whereof , what should hinder the king of Spaine to bring his forces home unto us ? For it is certain he hath long since set down in council , that there is no way for him wholly to recover those Low countries , but by bringing the war upon England it self , which hath always assisted them against him : and that being determined , and whereunto he hath be vehemently urged by the last years loss he sustained 518 upon our coasts , and the great dishonour this journey hath laid upon him ; no doubt if we shall give him respite to do it , but he will mightily advance his purpose , for he is richly able thereunto , and wonderful desirous of revenge . To encounter wherewith , I wish even in true and honest zeal to my Country , that we were all persuaded that there is no such assured means for the safety of our estate , as to busy him with a well furnished army in Spaine , which hath so many goodly Baize open , as we may land without impeachment as many men as shall be needful for such and invasion . And having and army of 20000 royally furnished there , we shall not need to take much care for their payment : for shall not Lisbon be thought able to make so few men rich , when the Suburbs thereof were found so abounding in riches , as had we made enemy of them , they had largely enriched us all ?
