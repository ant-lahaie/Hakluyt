between Negroponte and Andri , being likewise Hands . The 13 in the morning we were hard by Psara and Sarafo , being Hands nine or tenne miles from Chio , and could not fetch Chio . So we put room with a port in Metelin called Signora , and about nine of the clock at night we anchored there . The 15 we came from thence , the sixteenth we put into Porto Delfi . The port is 9 English miles to the Northward of the City of Chio , ( and it may be twelve of their miles ) this night we stayed in the said port , being in the Hand of Chio . Then went our Merchant and one or two with him to the City of Chio . And when the By , who is the governor of the Hand ( and is in their language a Duke ) had communed with the Merchant , and those that were with him , and understood of our arrival within his dominion , the day following he armed his galleys , and came to welcome our Ambassador , accompanied with the Ermine , that is , the Kings Customer , and also the French Consuli , with diverse of the chief of the City , and offered him as much friendship as he could or would desire : for he did offer to attend 25 Â° upon us , and tow us if need were to the Castles . The 21 we departed from thence , and that day passed by port Signora again . This Hand of Metelin is part of Asia , and is near to Natolia . The 22 we passed by a head land called Baberno , and is also in Asia . And that day at night we passed by the Isle of Tenedo , part of Asia , and by another Hand called Maure . And the same day we passed thorough the straights of Galipoli , and by the Castles , and also by the Town of Galipoli it self , which stands in Europa . And that night we were in sighed of Marmora which is near Natolia
