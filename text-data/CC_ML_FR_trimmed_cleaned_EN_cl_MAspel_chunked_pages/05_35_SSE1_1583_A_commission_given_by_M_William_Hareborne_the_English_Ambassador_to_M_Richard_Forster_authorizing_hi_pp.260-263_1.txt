Nation at Tripolis of the certain day of your landing , to the end they both may have their house in a readiness , and also meet you personally at your entrance to accompany you , being your self appareled in the best manner . The next , second , or third day , after your coming , give it out that you be crazed and not well disposed , by means of your travel at Sea , during which time , you and those there are most wisely to determine in what manner you are to present your self to the Beglerbi , Cadi , and other officers : who every of them are to be presented according to the order accustomed of others formerly in like office : which after the note of John Blank , late Vice - consul of Tripolis for the French , delivered you 261 herewith , is very much : and therefore , if thereof you can save any thing , I pray you do it , as I doubt not but you will .

Which if contrariwise you omit and forget , your enemies malice shall satisfied with your confusion , which God defend , and for his mercies sake keep
