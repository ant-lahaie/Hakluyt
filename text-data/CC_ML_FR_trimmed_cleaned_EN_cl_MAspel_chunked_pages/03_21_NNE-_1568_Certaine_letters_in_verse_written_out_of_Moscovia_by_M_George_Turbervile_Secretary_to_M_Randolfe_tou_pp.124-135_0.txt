Certain letters in verse , written by Master George Turbervile out of Moscovia , which went as Secretary thither with Master Tho . Randolph , her Majesties Ambassador to the Emperor 1568 , to certain friends of his in London , describing the manners of the Country and people . To his especial friend Master Edward Dancie . MY Dancie deer , when I recount within my breast , My London friends , and wonted mates , and thee above the rest : I feel a thousand fits of deep and deadly woe , To think that I from land to sea , from bliss to bale did go . I left my native soil , full like a retchless man , And unacquainted of the coast , among the Russes ran : A people passing rude , to vices vile inclined , Folk fit to be of Bacchus train , so quaffing is their kind . Drink is their whole desire , the pot is all their pride , The sobrest head does once a day stand needful of a guide . If he to banquet bid his friends , he will not shrink On them at dinner to bestow a douzen kinds of drink : 124 Such liquour as they have , and as the country gives , But chiefly two , one called Kvas , whereby the Mousike lives . Small beware and waterlike , but somewhat tart in taste , The rest is Mead of honey made , wherewith their lips they baste . And if he go unto his neighbour as a guest , He cares for title meat , if so his drink be of the best . No wonder though they use such vile and beastly trade , Sith with the hatchet and the hand , their chiefest gods be made . Their Idols have their hearts , on God they never call , Unless it be ( Nichola Bough ) that hangs against the wall . The house that hath no god , or painted Saint within , Is not to be resorted to , that roof is full of sin . Beside their private gods , in open places stand Their crosses
