whose Vertex is the Centre of the Sun , the Basis a line extended from Saint Thomas Hand under the Equinoctial , unto Paris in France near the same Meridian : therefore the two Angles of the Base must needs be equal per 5 . primi , Ergo the force of the heat equal , if there were no other cause then the reason of the Angle , as the old Philosophers have appointed . But In June is because at Paris the Sun riseth two hours before it m ^ then0 * r ^ set ^ to under the Equinoctial , and sets like - under the wise two hours after them , by means of the obliquity Equinoctial , of the Horizon , in which time of the Suns presence foure hours in one place more then the other , it works some effect more in one place then in the other , and being of equal height at noon , it must then needs follow to be more hight in the Parallel of Paris , then it is under the Equinoctial . 258 Also this is and other reason , that when the Sun sets to them under the Equinoctial , it goes very deep and low under their Horizon , almost even to their Antipodes , whereby their twilights are very short , twilights and their nights are made very extreme dark and long , and ’ sl ® rter . ’ and so the moisture and coldness of the long nights darker under wonderfully increases , so that at length the Sun the Equinoc - rising can hardly in many hours consume and drive at away the cold humours and moist vapours of the night Paris ' past , which is clean contrary in the Parallel of Paris : for the Sun goes under their Horizon but very little , after a sloping sort , whereby their nights are not very dark , but lightsome , as looking into the North in a clear night without clouds it doth manifestly appear , their twilights are long : for the Parallel of Cancer cutteth not the Horizon of
