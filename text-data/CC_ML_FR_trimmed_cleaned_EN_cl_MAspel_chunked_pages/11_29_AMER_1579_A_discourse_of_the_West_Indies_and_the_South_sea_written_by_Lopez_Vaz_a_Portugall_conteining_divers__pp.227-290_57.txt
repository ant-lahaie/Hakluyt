the valiantest man for the general in the wars . The kings of Peru in times past could never conquer this part of Chili , nor yet any other kings of the Indians . The weapons used by these people of Arauco are long pikes , halberds , bows and arrows : they also make them jacks of seal - skins , and headpieces : in times passed the heads of their halberds and pikes were of brass , but now they have got store of iron . They pitch their battles in manner like the Christians : for putting their pikemen in ranks , they place bowmen among them , and marshal their troops with discretion and great valour . Now the Spaniards coming unto this province sent word unto them by other Indians , saying that they were the children of God , and came to teach them the word of God , and that therefore they ought to yield themselves unto them : if not , they would shoot fire among them and burn them . These people not fearing the great words of the Spaniards , but desiring to see that which they had herd reported , met them in the field , and fought a most cruel battle : but by reason of the Spaniards great ordinance and calivers , they were in the end put to flight . Now these Indians thinking verily that the Spaniards were the children of God , because of their great ordinance which made such a noise , and breathed out such flames of fire , yielded themselves unto them . So the Spaniards having divided this province made the Indians to serve their turns for getting of gold out of the mines , which they enjoyed in such abundance , that he which had least had 20000 pezos , but Captain Baldivia himself had 300000 pezos 275 Villa neuva de la Serena , La Concepcion , Sant lag ) , La Imperial , Baldivia , La Villam rica , the first sixe towns that wereinhdbited in Chili .
