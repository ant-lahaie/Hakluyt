the Generals ( having indeed proceeded from other heads : ) let the necessity of conserving the reputation of the actium in general , & the honours of our Generals in particular , be my sufficient excuse : the one having by the virtue of the other made our country more dreaded & renowned , then any act that ever England undertook before . Or if you have thought my perswasible discourse long in the latter end ; let the affectionate desire of my countries ' good be therein answerable for me . And such as it is I pray you accept it , as only recommended to your self , and not to be delivered to the public view of the world , lest any man take offence thereat : which some particular men may seem justly to do , in that having deserved very well , I should not herein give them their due commendations : whereas my purpose in this private discourse hath be only to gratify you with a touch of those principali matters that have passed , wherein I have only taken notes of those men who either commanded 526 every service , or were of chiefest mark : if therefore you shall impart the same to one , and he to another , and so it pass through my hands , I know not what constructions would be made thereof to my prejudice ; for that the Hares ears may happily be taken for homes . Howbeit I hold it very necessary ( I must confess ) that there should be some true manifestation made of these things : but be it far from me to be the author thereof , as very unfit to deliver my censure of any matter in public , & most unwilling to have my weakness discovered in private . And so I do leave you to the happy success of your accustomed good exercises , earnestly wishing that there may be some better acceptance made of the fruits of your studies , then there hath be of our hazards in the wars . From London the 30 of August 1589 .
