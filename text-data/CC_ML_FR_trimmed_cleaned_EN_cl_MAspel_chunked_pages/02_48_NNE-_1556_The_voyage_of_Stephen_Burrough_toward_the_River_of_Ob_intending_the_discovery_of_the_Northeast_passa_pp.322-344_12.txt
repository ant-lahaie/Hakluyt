came to and anchor within half a league of the shore , where we had good plenty of fish , both Haddocks and Cods , riding in io fathom water . Wednesday we weighed , and plied nearer the headland , 8 which is called Caninoz , the wind being at East and by North . Thursday the wind being scant we turned to windwards 9 the ebb , to get about Caninoz : the latitude this day at noon was 68 degrees 40 minutes . Friday we turned to the windward of the ebb , but to 10 no purpose : and as we road at and anchor , we saw the similitude of a storm rising at Northnorthwest , & could not tell where to get road nor succour for that wind , and harbour we knew none : & that land which we road under with that wind was a lee shore . And as I was musing what was best to be done , I saw a sail come out of a creek under the foresaid Caninoz , which was my friend Gabriel , who forsook his harbour and company , and came as near us as he might , and pointed us to the Eastwards , & then we weighed and followed him , and went East and by South , the wind being at Westnorthwest , and very misty . Saturday we went Eastsoutheast & followed Gabriel , n and he brought us into and harbour called Morgiovets , Morgovets and which is 30 leagues from Caninoz , & we had upon the harbour . 333 bar going in two fathom and a fourth part : and after we were passed in over the bar , it waxed deeper , for we had 5 fathoms , 4 and a half , and 3 fathom etc . Our bark being mored , I sent some of our men to shore to pro - Drlft wood . vide wood , where they had plenty of drift wood , but none growing : and in this place we found plenty of young foul , as Guiles , Seapies , and others , whereof the Russes would eat
