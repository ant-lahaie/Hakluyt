here most certainly assure you , that there be many ways to Peru . 236 But now I will return to my former discourse . Upon the seacoast of Tierra firma Eastward from Cartagena stands a little town called Santa Martha , between which town and Cartagena the mighty river of Magdalen before nam falls into the sea with such a strong current , that by reason thereof it is known 20 leagues from the shore . Santa Martha is a very poor town , because it hath often be robbed by the Frenchmen , and hath no trade but with a few Indians that dwell thereabouts . Here begins that wonderful long ridge of high mountains covered with snow , which stretching through many countries ' , runneth along the kingdoms of Peru and Chili , and continueth to the very straights of Magellan . These mountains are seen with snow upon their tops above thirtie leagues into the sea . At the foot of these wild mountains there is a valley called Tagrona , which is the richest place that is known thereabouts : but because the country adjoining is so mountainous , and the inhabitants so many and of so good a courage , shooting poisoned arrows which are present death to such as are wounded with the same ; therefore it lies as yet unconquered , notwithstanding it hath cost many Spanish captains their lives . Passing along the coast of Tierra firma to the East of Santa Martha , where is and other small town of above and hundred houses called Rio de Hacha . This town is somewhat rich by reason of the pearls which they get there . Also they have a trade with the Indians for some small quantity of gold . From hence they go along the coast to Cabo de la Vela , which because it is of the same property with Rio de Hacha before mentioned , I omit to speak of it . Upon this coast there is a lake or gulf which openeth into the sea , at the mouth whereof they gather great store of pearls .
