sureties for 2000 ducats , we should go abroad in the town : which when we could not do , the said Padres found sureties for us , that we should not depart the country without the licence of the Viceroy . It does spite the Italians to see us abroad : and many marvel at our delivery . The painter is in the cloister of S . Paul , and is of their order , and liketh there very well . While we were in prison , both at Ormuz and here , there was a great deal of our goods pilfered and lost , and we have been at great charges in gifts and otherwise , so that a great deal of our goods is consumed . There is much of our things which will fell very well , & some we shall get nothing for . I hope in God that at the return of the Viceroy , which is gone to Chaul and to Diu , they say , to win a castle of the Moors , whose return is thought will be about Easter , then we shall get our liberty , and our sureties discharged . Then I think it will be our best way , either one or both to return , because our troubles have be so great , & so much of our goods spoiled and lost . But if it please God that I come into England , by Gods help , I will return hither again . It is a brave and pleasant country , and very fruitful . The summer is almost all the year long , but the chiefest at Christmas . The day and the night are all of one length , very little difference , and marvelous great store of fruits . For all our great troubles , yet are we fat and well liking , for victuals are here plenty and good cheap . And here I will pass over to certify you of strange things , until our meeting , for it would be too long to write thereof . And thus I commit you to God , who ever preserve you and us all . From Goa in the East Indies the 25 of Januarie 1584 . Yours to command , Ralph Fitch . 464
