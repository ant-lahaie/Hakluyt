the princes own word and meaning , as I suppose . But I could not help the matter being far from the prince , neither could I tell how to have redress , because by absence I could not complain . Notwithstanding I used my endeavour , and sent a messenger John Norton one of your servants from Vologda to Novogrod , where the court then lay , expressly with letters , as well to advertise his majesty that the said Rutter was not sent unto me according to his highness commandment & order , as also about the dispatch of the said letters of privilege and receipt of your money , with straight charge that he should in any wise return unto me again before the departing of the ships . And the first day of June I departed from the said Vologda by water towards Colmogro , where I arrived the 21 of June aforesaid , and remained there until the 23 of July , looking for the said John Norton to have returned unto me in all that time , which had respite fully enough in that space both to go to the court to dispatch his business , and to have returned again unto me , but he came not , for it was otherwise determined before his going , as I did after understand , and can more at large by word of mouth declare unto your worships the occasion thereof . Nevertheless , I am well assured before this time your Agent hath received into his hands the said letters of privileges , and shall have dispatch with expedition in all things touching your affairs , according to his majesties 194 grant by me obtained , and as he hath written to the Queens majesty at this present , wishing that as now by my going the Emperor hath withdrawn his grievous displeasure from you , and restored you again into his favour , so your Agent and others your servants there resident may behave , & endeavour themselves to keep & augment the same , whose evil doings have be the only occasion of his indignation now remitted .
