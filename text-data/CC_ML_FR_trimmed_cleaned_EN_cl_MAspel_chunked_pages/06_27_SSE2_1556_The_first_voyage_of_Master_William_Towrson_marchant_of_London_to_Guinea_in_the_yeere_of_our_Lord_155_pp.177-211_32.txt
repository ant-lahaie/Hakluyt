mean time the Portugals came running from the hill upon them , whereof the Negroes a little before had given them warning , and bade them to go away but they per - invaded our ceived it not . The son of DONE John conspired with men . the Portugales against them , so that they were almost upon them , but yet they recovered their boat and set off from the shore , and the Portugales shot their 203 calivers at them , but hurt no man , and then the ship perceiving it , shot off the two pieces aforesaid among them . Hereupon we laid bases in both the boats , and in the Skiff and manned them well , and went a shore again , but because of the wind we could not land , but lay off in the sea about ten score and shot at them , but the hill succoured them , and they from the rocks and from the hills shot at us with their half hakes , and the Negroes more for fear then for love stood by them to help them , and when we saw that the Negroes were in such subjection unto them that they durst not fell us any thing for fear of them we went aboard , and that night the wind kept at the East , so that we could not with our ship fetch the Hind , but I took the boat in the night and went aboard the bark to see what was there to be done , and in the morning we perceived the town to be in like case laid with Portugales , so we weighed and went along the coast . This town of John de Viso stands upon and hill like the town of DONE John , but it hath been burned , so that there are not passing sixe houses in it : the most part of the gold that comes thither comes out of the country , and no doubt if the people durst for fear of the Portugals bring forth their gold , there would be had good store
