our ship fish as ' long as a man , which they call Tuberones , they come to eat such things as from the ship fallen into the sea , not refusing men themselves if they light upon them . And if they find any meat tied in the sea , they take it for theirs . These have waiting on them six or seven small fish ( which never depart ) with guards blue and green round about their bodies , like comely serving men : and they go two or three before him , and some on every side . Moreover , they have other fish which cleave always unto their body , and seem to take such superfluities as grow about them , and they are said to enter into their bodies also to purge them if they need . The Mariners in time passed have eaten of them , but since they have seen them eat men their stomachs abhor them . Nevertheless , they draw them up with great hooks , & kill of them as many as they can , thinking that they have made a great revenge . There is another kind of fish as big almost as a herring , which hath wings and flies , and they are together in great number . These have two enemies , the one in the sea , the other in the air . In the sea the fish which is called Albocore , as big as a Salmon , follows them with great swiftness to take them . This poor fish not being able swim fast , for he hath no fins , but swimmeth with moving of his tail , shutting his wings , lifts himself above the water , and flies not very high : the Albocore seeing that , although he have no wings , yet he gives a great leap out of the water , and sometime catches him , or else he keepeth himself under the water going that way on as fast as he flies . And when the fish being weary of 381 the air , or thinking himself out of danger , returns into the water , the Albocore meeteth with him : but sometime his other enemy the sea - crow , catches him Note . before
