, n 161 L truly the danger & way is shorter to us , then to Spaine or Portingall , as by evident reasons appeareth . Note . And now to declare something of the commodity and utility of this Navigation and discovery : it is very clear and certain , that the Seas that commonly men say , without great danger , difficulty and peril , yea rather it is impossible to pass , that those same Seas be navigable and without any such danger , but that ships may pass and have in them perpetuali clearness of the day without any darkness of the night : which thing is a great commodity for the navigants , to see at all times round about them , as well the safeguards as dangers , and how great difference it is between the commodity and perils of other which lose the most part of every foure and twentie hours the said light , and go in darkness groping their way , I think there is none so ignorant but perceives this more plainly , then it can be expressed . Yea what a vantage shall your Graces subject ' s have also by this light to discover the strange lands , countries , and coasts ? For if they that be discovered , to sail by them in darkness is with great danger , much more then the coasts not discovered be dangerous to travel by night or in darkness . Yet these dangers or darkness hath not letted the Spanyards and Por - tingals and other , to discover many unknown Realms to their great peril . Which considered ( and that your Graces subject ' s may have the same light ) it will seem your Graces subject ' s to be without activity or courage , in leaving to do this glorious and noble enterprise . For they being passed this little way which they nam so dangerous , ( which may be two or three leagues before Navigation they come to the Pole , and as much more after they under thePok . pass the Pole ) it is clear , that from thence forth the seas and lands are as temperate as in these parts , and that then it may be at the will and pleasure
