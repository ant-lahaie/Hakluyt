ship . The 15 of April , moving our company for the voyage to Benin , the most part of them all refused it . The 16 , seeing the unwillingness of the company to go thither , we determined to spend as much time upon the coast as we could , to the end we might make our voyage , and agreed to leave the Minion here at Egrand , the Tiger to go to Pericow which is foure leagues off , and the Christopher to go to Weamba , which is ten leagues to the weatherward of this place : and if any of them both should have sighed of more sails then they thought good to meddle withal , to come room with their fellows : to wit , first the Christopher to come with the Tiger , and then both they to come with us . We remained in this place called Egrand , until the last day of April , in which time many of our men fell 242 sick ; and sixe of them died . And here we could have no traffic with the Negroes but three or foure days in the week , and all the rest of the week they would not come at us . The 3 of May not having the pinnace sent us with cloth from the other ships , as they promised , we sold French cloth , and gave but three yards thereof to every fuffe . The 5 day the Negroes departed , and told us they would come to us again within foure days , which we determined there to tarry , although we had diverse of our men sick . The 8 day , all our cloth in the Minion being sold , I called the company together , to know whither they would tarry the sale of the cloth taken in the prize at this place or no : they answered , that in respect of the death of some of their men , and the present sickness of twenty Sickness . more , they would not tarry , but repair to the other ships , of whom they had herd nothing since
