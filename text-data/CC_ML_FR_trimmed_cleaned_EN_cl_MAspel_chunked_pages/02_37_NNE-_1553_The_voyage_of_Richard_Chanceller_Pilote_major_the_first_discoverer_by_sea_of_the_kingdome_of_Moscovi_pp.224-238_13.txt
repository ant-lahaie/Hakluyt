to bail him . If he be a picker or a cutpurse , as there be very many , the second time he is taken , he hath a piece of his Nose cut ofF , and is burned in the forehead , and kept in prison till he find sureties for his good behaviour . And if he be taken the third time , he is hanged . And at the first time he is extremely punished and not released , except he have very good friends , or that some Gentleman require to have him to the wars : And in so doing , he shall enter into great bonds for him : by which means the country is brought into good quietness . But they be naturally given to great deceit , except extreme beating did bridle them . They be naturally given to hard living aswell in fare as in lodging . I herd a Russian say , that it was a great deal merrier living in prison then forth , but for the great beating . For they have meat and drink without any labour , and get the charity of well disposed people : But being at liberty they get nothing . The poor is very innumerable , and live most miserably : for I have seen them eat the pickle of Hearing and other stinking fish : nor the fish cannot be so stinking nor rotten , but they will eat it and praise it to be more wholesome then 235 other fish or fresh meat . In mine opinion there be no such people under the sun for their hardness of living . Well , I will leave them in this point , and will in part declare their Religion . They do observe the law of the Greeks with such excess of superstition , as the like hath not be herd of . They have no graved images in their Churches , but all painted , to the intent they will not break the commandment : but to their painted images they use such idolatry , that the like was never herd of
