the Portugals and Moors , they [ II ii . 70 . ] would be sold here for nothing . But it so falling out , that the Chineans are the greatest eaters in all the world , they do feed upon all things , specially on pork , which , the fatter it is , is unto them the less loathsome . The highest price of these things aforesaid 1 have set down , better cheap shall you sometime buy them for the great plenty thereof in this country . Frogs are sold at the same price that is made of hens , and are good meat among them , as also dogs , cats , rats , snakes , and all other unclean meats . The Cities be very gallant , specially near unto the gates , the which are marvellously great , and covered with iron . The gatehouses are built on high with towers , & the lower part thereof is made of brick & stone , proportionally with the walls , from the walls upward the 299 building is of timber , and many stories in it one above the other . The strength of their towns is in the mighty walls and ditches , artillery have they none . The streets in Cinceo , and in all the rest of the Cities we have seen are very fair , so large and so straight , that it is wonderful to behold . Their houses are built with timber , the foundations only excepted , the which are laid with stone : in each side of the streets are pentises or continual ! porches for the merchants to walk under : the breadth of the streets is nevertheless such , that in them 15 . men may ride commodiously side by side . As they ride they must needs pass under many high arches of triumph that cross over the streets made of timber , and carved diversely , covered with tiles of fine clay : under these arches the Mercers do utter their smaller wares , & such as list to stand there are defended from rain and the heat of the Sun
