Most sovereign king , mighty prince , gracious lord , and unto us most unfeignedly beloved , we received of late your gracious letters by your Majesties liege subject John Brown , the contents whereof seemed to be these following : first that of long time heretofore , there have be between the merchants of your realm & of our lands , not only quiet & peaceable access one unto another , but also mutual participation , & common traffic of their wares , being right commodious & available for them both : howbeit , that now the foresaid profitable conversation , by reason of certain notorious robberies , committed upon the sea by pirates against both parts , 8c the wonted access also of your subject ' s unto our dominions , were altogether forbidden . Moreover , you call to remembrance the ancient amity 8c friendship between both our lands , with the invaluable commodity of sweet amiable peace , which are by all faithful Christians , to the utmost of their endeavour to be embraced . Whereupon you of your exceeding clemency , do offer your Majesties fill consent , that the foresaid prohibition being released until the feast of Easter next ensuing , the said merchants of your dominions may in our territories , and our merchants likewise may in your realms ( all molestations ceasing ) exercise their wonted traffic : especially since in the mean season your royal wisdom hath determined to direct unto us your hono : ambassadors in friendly sort to treat and parley with us as touching the pretended injuries , so far forth as they may concern your subject ' s . Adding moreover in particular that when your people shall repair unto the parts of Sconia to fish for herrings , having consideration & regard unto your majesty , we would have them especially recommended unto our protection
