verde . The 24 we were directly under the tropic of Cancer . The first day of May Henry Wilson our Steward died : and the next day died John Underwood . The fift day we were in the heighth of S . Michael . The 23 we had sighed of a ship in the weather of us , which was a Frenchman of 90 tun , who came with us as stoutly and as desperately as might be , and coming near us perceived that we had be upon a long voyage , and judging us to be weak , as in deed we were , came nearer us , and thought to have laid us aboard , & there stepped up some of his men in armour , and commanded us to strike sail : whereupon we sent them some of our stuff , crossebarres , and chainshot , and arrows , so thick , that it made the upper work of their ship fly about their ears , and we spoiled him with all his men , and tore his ship miserably with our great ordinance , and then he began to fallen a stern of us , and to pack on his sails , and get away : and we seeing that , gave him foure or five good pieces more for his farewell ; and thus we were rid of this French man , who did us not harm at all . We had aboard us a French man a Trumpeter , who being sick , and lying in his bed , took his trumpet notwithstanding , and sounded till he could found no more , and so died . 230 The 28 we conferred together , and agreed to go into Severne , and so to Bristoll , but the same night we had sighed of the Lizard , and by reason of the wind , we were not able to double the lands end to go into Severne , but were forced to bear in with the Lizard . The 29 day , about nine of the clock in the morning , we arrived safely in Plimmouth , and praised God for our good arrival .
