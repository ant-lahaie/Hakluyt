are unarmed , must ( according to you Tartars custom ) march behind their fellows , and discharge at the enemy with long bows and crossbows . And ( as it is above said of the Tartars ) they must orderly dispose their bands and troops , and ordain laws for their soldiers . Whosoever runneth to the prey or spoil , before the victory be achieved , must undergo a most severe punishment . For such a fellow is put to death among the Tartars without all pity or mercy . The place of battle must be chosen , if it be possible , in a plain field , where they may see round about , neither must * 57 all be in one company , but in many and several bands , not very far distant one from another . They which give the first encounter must send one band before , and must have another in a readiness to relieve and second the former in time convenient . They must have spies also on every side to give them notice when the rest of the enemies bands approach . For therefore ought they always to send forth band against band & troop against troop , because the Tartar ever practiseth to get his enemy in the midst and so to environ him . Let our bans take this caveat also , if the enemy retire , not to make any long pursuit after him , lest peradventure ( according to his custom ) he might draw them into some secret ambush : for the Tartar fights more by policy then by main force . And again , lest our horses be tired : for we are not so well stored with horses as they . Those horses which the Tartars use one day , they ride not upon three or foure days after . Moreover , if the Tartars draw homeward , our men must not therefore depart and casseir their bands , or separate themselves asunder : because they do this upon policy , namely to have our army divided , that they may more securely invade and
