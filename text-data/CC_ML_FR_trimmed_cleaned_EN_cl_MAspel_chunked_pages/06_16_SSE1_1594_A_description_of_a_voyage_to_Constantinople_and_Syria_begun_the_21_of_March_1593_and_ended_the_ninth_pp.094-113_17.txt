judgement of God upon the owners sometime of these houses , as I was credibly informed by a Cipriot a merchant of good wealth in this city . Before it came in subjection to the Turks , while it was under the Venetians , there were many barons and noble men of the Cipriots , who partly by usurping more superiority over the common people then they ought , and partly through their great revenues which yearly came in by their cotton wool and wines , grew so insolent and proud , and withal so impiously wicked , as that they would at their pleasure command both the wives and children of their poor tenants to serve their unclean lustest , 8c holding them in such slavery as though they had been no better then dogs , would wage them against a grayhound or spaniel , and he who won the wager should ever after hold them as his proper goods and chattels , to do with them as he listed , being Christians aswell as themselves , if they may deserve so good a name . As they behaved themselves most unchristianly towards their brothers , so and much more ungodly ( which I should have put in the first place ) did they towards God : for as though they were too great , standing on foot or kneeling to serve God , they would come riding on horseback into the church to hear their mass : which church now is made a public basistane or market place for the Turkes to fell commodities in : but behold the judgement of the righteous God , who payeth the sinner measure for measure . The 109 A . D . Â» 595 - Nicosia . A great judgement of God upon the noble men of Cyprus . Turkes the year before the overthrow given them at Lepanto by DONE John took Cyprus . These mighty Nimrods fled some into holes & some into mountains to hide themselves ; whereupon the Turkes made generail proclamation , that if they would all come in and yield themselves , they would restore them to their former revenues and dignities
