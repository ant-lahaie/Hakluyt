moun - Â® metetec - taines of Xicayan the Touer about 24 . leagues from this haven , from diverse brooks which come out of the mountains of Cacatepec , and beneath a town called Suchistlahuaca little more then 3 . leagues all the brooks join together : and from that place you may pass down to the sea with Canoas and Lighters : and you might come farther but for the fallen of a furious stream or current which runneth between two great rocks , passing from Cocahulapa a mansion of Ometepec unto Yanguitle a mansion of the said Ometepec . These inconveniences being passed ( which in my judgement may be about one league ) the river is more navigable , so that you may sail in the same about 12 . leagues . During the space of which 12 . leagues , about a league and a half distance from the waters side , and in many other parts of the same river it hath great quantity of woods which use to grow in hight soils , fit for shiptimber , as Huber - trees , & Suchicuhitil , whereof they of Nicaragua make great profit . Also there be white Nicaragua . oaks and Tehegurtes in great quantity , and many other kinds of timber : and in the mountains there be firtrees , oaks , and cork - trees , which easily may be carried down the river , because they may be cut some 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 . leagues from the river , and may be brought down to the waters side with the service and help of those that dwell in the towns thereabouts . At the head of these brooks where the river begins is the town which is called Xicaian , belonging to the Xicalan . heirs of Francis the Touer y de Guillen , containing about 350 . Indians of rude speech and of little policy , being 24 . leagues from the sea , little more or less . 467 The place it self is hight , although the mountains round about be cold . A little from this is the town of Aioanapa possessed Aioanapa . by heirs of perez Gomez , having in it about 300 . Indians of the self same speech and quality . The country is more subject to heat then cold
