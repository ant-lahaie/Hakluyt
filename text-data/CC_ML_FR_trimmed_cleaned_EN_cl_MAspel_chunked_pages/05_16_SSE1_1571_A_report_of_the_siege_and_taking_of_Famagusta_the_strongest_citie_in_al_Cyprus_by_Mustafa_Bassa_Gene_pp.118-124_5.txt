, because you are so well acquainted with the Italian copy , as I know : yet I trust your lordship will not mislike , that the same which is both pleasant to read , and so necessary to be known for diverse of our captains and other our countrymen , which are ignorant in the Italian tongue , may thus now show it self abroad , covered under the wing of your lordship ' s protection . Certainly it moveth me much to remember the loss of those three notable Hands , to the great discomfort of all Christendome , to those hellish Turkes , horseleeches of Christian blood : namely Rhodes besieged on S . John Baptists day , and taken on Johns day the Evangelist , being the 27 of December 1522 . Scio or Chios being 122 lost since my being there , taken of Piali Basham with 80 galleys , the 17 of April 1566 . And now last of all not only Famagusta the chief hold & fortress in Cyprus Cyprus lost . to have be lost of the Venetians the 15 of August last passed 1571 ( the chief governors & captains of them being hewn in sunder by the commandment of that tyrant Mustafa Basham ) but all the whole Hand also to be conquered by those cruel Turks , ancient professed enemies to all Christian religion . In the which evil success ( coming to us as I take it for our offences ) as I lament the generail loss : so I am surely pensive to understand by this too true a report of the vile death of two particular noble gentlemen of Venice , Sig . M . Lorenzo Tiepolo , and Sig . M . Giovanni Antonio Querini : of both the which I in my travail was very courteously used , the former of them being then ( as now also he was in this overthrow ) governor of Baffo in Cyprus , the other captain of one of the castles at Corcyra in Greece , now called Corfu . But things past are passed amendment , and they could never die more
