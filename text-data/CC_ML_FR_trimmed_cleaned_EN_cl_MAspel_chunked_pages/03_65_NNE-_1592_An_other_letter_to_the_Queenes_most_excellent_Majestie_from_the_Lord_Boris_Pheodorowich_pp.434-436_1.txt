have received from your loving brother our Lord and Master by your ambassador , therein you perceive sufficiently my good meaning , in travailing for the continuance of amity and friendship betwixt you mighty great princes , in the which I will continue mine endeavour . Also your merchant ' s I have taken into my protection for to defend them for the love I bear to your Majesty . As heretofore I have done it willingly , and with great care of their good , so I mean to continue so far as God will give me leave : to the end that brotherly love be held between you Princes without disturbance . As 1 have been to your merchant ' s in times past , so now by the permission and commandment of our Lord and Master , I will be their defendor in all causes : and will cause all our authorised people to favour them and to defend them , and to give them free liberty to buy and fell at their pleasure . The merchant ' s do not certify your princely Majesty of all our friendship and favour showed unto them from time to time . And whereas your Majesty hath now written to our Lord and Master for the debts which your merchant ' s ought to have of William Turnebull lately diseased , I having perused your Majesties letter , whereby I am requested to be a mean for the recovery and obtaining of their said debts , I have moved it to our Lord and King his Majesty , that order may be given therein : and that his kinsman Rainold Kitchen with three persons more may be sent over together with the said Turnebulles 435 stuff and other things , as bills , books and writings . All which shall be delivered to your merchant ' s Agent and his fellows , and in money 600 rubbles of the said Turnebulles . And touching your merchant ' s , I will have a great care over them , and protect them , whereby they shall suffer no damages in their trade : and all kind of traffic in merchandise shall be at their liberty . Written in our Lord and Kings Majesties royal city of Mosco , in the year from the beginning of the world 7101 , in the month of Januarie .
