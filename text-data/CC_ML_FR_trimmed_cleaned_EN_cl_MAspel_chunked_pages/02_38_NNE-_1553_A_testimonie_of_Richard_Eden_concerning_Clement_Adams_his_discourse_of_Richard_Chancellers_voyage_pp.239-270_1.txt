a course and mean for them also to obtain the like , they thereupon resolved upon a new and strange Navigation . And whereas at the same time one Sebastian Cabota , a man in those days very renowned , happened to be in London , they began first of all to deal and consult diligently with him , and after much speech and conference together , it was at last concluded that three ships should be prepared and furnished out , for the search and discovery of the Northern part of the world , to open a way and passage to our men for travail to new and unknown kingdoms . And whereas many things seemed necessary to be regarded in this so hard and difficult a matter , they first make choice of certain grave and wise persons in manner of a Senate or company , which should lay their heads together , and give their judgements , and provide things requisite and profitable for all occasions : by this company it was thought expedient , that a certain sum of money should publicly be collected to serve for the furnishing of so many ships . And lest any private man should be too much oppressed and charged , a course was taken , that every man willing to be of the society , should disburse the portion of twentie and five pounds a piece : so that in short time by this means the sum of sixe thousand pounds being gathered , the three ships were bought , the most part whereof they provided to be newly built and trimmed . But in this actium , I wot not whither I may more admire the care of the Merchants , or the diligence of the Shipwrights : for the Merchants , they get very strong and well seasoned planks for the building , the Shippewrights , they with daily travail , and their greatest skill do fit them for the dispatch of the ships : they calk them , pitch them , and among the 240 rest , they make one most staunch and firm , by and excellent and ingenious invention .
