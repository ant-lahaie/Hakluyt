strong for the West India : to impeach him , and to ranconter his force he appointed this fleet ; although looking for the arrival of his East Indian caracks , he first ordained those ships to waft them from the Azores . But persuading himself , that if the fleet of sir Walter Ralegh did go for the West India , then the Hands should have none to infest them but small men of war , which the caracks of themselves would be well able to match ; his order was to DONE Alonso de Ba ? and brother to the Marks of Santa Cruz , and general of his armada , to pursue sir Walters fleet , and to confront him , what course soever he held . And that this was true , our men in short time by proof understood : for sir John Burrough , not long after the taking of his last prize the flyboat , as he sailed back again towards the rest of his company , discovered the Spanish fleet to seaward of him : which having likewise espied him betwixt them and the shore , made full account to bring him safe into Spanish harbour ; and therefore spread themselves in such sort before him , that indeed his danger was very great : for both the liberty of the sea was brought into a narrow straight , and the shore being enemy could give him no comfort of relief : so that trusting to Gods help only and his good sail , he thrust out from among them in spite of all their force , and to the notable illusion of all their cunning , which they showed to the uttermost , in laying the way for his apprehension . But now sir John Burrough having happily escaped their douches , finding the coast guarded by this fleet , and knowing it was but folly to expect a meeting there with sir Martin Frobisher ( who understanding of this armada aswell as himself , would be sure not to come that way ) began to shape his course to the Azores
