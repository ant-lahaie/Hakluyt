The travails of Ranulph Glanvile earl of Chester . The same in English . RAnulph Glanvile earl of Chester , a man of a very noble house , and learned in both the Laws , deserves of duty to be here placed by me in the catalogue of worthy and notable men . He applied so well all the years of his youth to the study of humane and divine Laws , that he came not so soon to the age of a man , [ II i . 33 . ] as he had purchased to himself by reason of his singular learning , renown and honour . When the noble men of France went to Ptolomais , upon the counsel of John Bren king of Jerusalem , they resolved to besiege 35 Â° Damiata a city of Egypt , in the year 1218 . And then Henry the king upon the motion of Honorius the third , bishop of Room , sent thither this earl Ranulph with a great power of armed soldiers , to further the enterprise of the Christians : whose valour in that war ( by the testimony of Polidor Virgil ) was marvelously commended of all men . After the end of which business , he being returned into his country , wrote a book of the laws of England . It is also reported that he wrote other books , but time the destroyer of many memorials , hath taken them from us . He flourished in the year after the nativity of Christ 1230 , being very aged , and in the reign of K . Henry the third .
