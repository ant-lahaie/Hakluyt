town , and of many great assaults . THe Turks seeing that by mining they were nothing furthered , nor might not come to their intentions , and having but small store of gunpowder , were in deliberation and mind to have raised the siege , and gone their way . And in deed some of them bore their carriages towards the ships : and also certain number of people went out of the trenches with their standards straight to the ships . And it was written unto us from the camp how the Janissaries and other of the host would fight no more : and that they were almost all of one opinion for to go away , save some of the captains of the foresaid Mustafa Bassha or Acmek Bassha . And in the mean season the false traitors that were in the town wrote letters to the camp , giving them knowledge of all that 34 was said and done among us . And also and Albanese fled to the enemies camp , and warned them not to go , for the gunshot was nigh wasted , and that the most part of the knights and people should be theirs shortly . In like sort then wrote the abovesaid Chanceller Sir Andrew de Merall , whose treason as then was not known : but when it comes to the effect of his treason , I shall show the knowledge that he gave to the enemies at diverse times . When the bashas and captains of the host understood the said warnings , they all purposed for to tarry , and caused those tidings of the town to be known over all the army . And began again to shoot artillery faster then ever they did , for new shot was come into the camp . Then Mustafa Bassha being in despair that he could do nothing by mines , by gunshot , nor by assaults , he being ready to depart for to go into Surey by the great Turkes commandment , before his departing he thought once again to assay his adventure , and made three assaults three days together
