Their ship was not very great , but exceeding strong , for of a great number of bullets which had battered her , there were scarce 20 wherewith she was pierced or hurt : her upper work was of force sufficient to bear off a musket shot : this ship was shot thorough and pierced in the fight before Greveling ; insomuch that the leakage of the water could not be stopped : whereupon the duke of Medina sent his great skiff unto the governor thereof , that he might save himself and the principal persons that were in his ship : which he , upon a halt 226 courage , refused to do : wherefore the Duke charged him to sail next unto himself : which the night following he could not perform , by reason of the great abundance of water which entered his ship on all sides ; for the avoiding whereof , and to save his ship from sinking , he caused 50 men continually to labour at the pump , though it were to small purpose .
