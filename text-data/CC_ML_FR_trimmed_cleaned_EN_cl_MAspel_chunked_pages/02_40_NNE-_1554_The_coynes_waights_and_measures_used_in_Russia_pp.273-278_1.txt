so say they Poledenga , Denga , Altine and Rubble : There goes two Poledengas to a Denga , six Denga ' s to and Altine , and 23 Altines , and two Denga ' s to a Rubble . Concerning the weights of Russia they are these : There are two sorts of pounds in use among them , the one great , you other small : the great pound is just two small pounds : they call the great weight by the name of Beasemar , and the small they call the Skalla weight : with this small weight they weigh their silver coins , of the which the Emperor hath commanded to put to every small pound three Rubbles of silver , and with the same weight they weigh all Grocery wares , and almost all other wares which come into the land , except those which they weigh by the Pode , as hops , salt , iron , led , tin & batrie with diverse others , notwithstanding they use to weigh batrie more often by the small weight then by the great .

The pode does contain of the great weight , 40 pounds , and of the small 80 : there go 10 . podes to a shippond .

But for your just proof , weigh 6 Rubbles of Russia money with our pound weight , and then shall you see what it lacketh : for 6 Rubbles of Russia is by the Emperor ' s standard , the great pound
