month we set our course East and by North , reckoning our selves seventeene leagues distant from Cape Mensurado , the said Cape being Eastnortheast of us , and the river of Sesto being East . The one and twentieth day of the said month , we fell with Cape Mensurado to the Southeast , about tfao leagues off . This Cape may be easily known , by reason y * the rising of it is like a Porpose - head . Also towards the Southeast there are three trees , whereof the Eastermost tree is the highest , and the middlemost is like a high stack , & the Southermost like unto a gibbet : and upon the main are foure or five high hills rising one after another like round hommocks or hillocks . And the Southeast of the three trees , brandiernwise : and all the coast along is white sand . The said Cape stands within a little in sixe degrees . The two and twentieth of December we came to the river of Sesto , & remained there until the nine and twentieth day of the said month . Here we thought it best to send before us the pinnace to the river Dulce , called Rio Dulce , that they might have the beginning of the market before the coming of the John Evangelist . At the river of Sesto we had a tun of grains . This river stands in sixe degrees , lacking a terce . From the river of Sesto to Rio Dulce are five and twentie leagues . Rio Dulce stands in five degrees and a half . The river of Sesto is easy to be known , by reason there is a ledge of rocks on the Southeast part of the Road . And at the entering into the haven are five or sixe trees that bear no leaves . This is a good harbour , but very narrow at you entrance into the river . There is also a rock in the havens mouth right as you enter . And all that coast between Cape de Monte , and cape de las Palmas
