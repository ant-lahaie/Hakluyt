whipped , and sometime sent to prison , where lying that year when this kind of act was , we found many thus punished , and demanding the cause thereof , they said it was for that they knew not how to answer unto certain things asked them . It is a world to see how these Louteas are served and feared , in such wise , that in public assemblies at one shriek they give , all the servitors belonging unto justice tremble thereat .

For the dignity they have , and office they do bear , they be all accompanied : the very meanest of them all that goes in these seats is ushered by two men at the least , that cry unto the people to give place , howbeit they need it not , for that reverence the common people have unto them . They have also in their company certain Sergeants with their Maces either silvered or altogether silver , some two , some foure , other sixe , other eight , conveniently for each one his degree . The more principal and chief Louteas have going orderly before these Sergeants , many other with staves , and a great many catchpoules with rods of Indish canes dragged on the ground , so that the streets being paved , you may hear afar off as well the noise of the rods , as the voice of the criers . These fellows serve also to apprehend others , and the better to be known they wear livery read girdles , and in their caps peacocks feathers . Behind these Louteas come such as do bear certain tables hanged at staves ends , wherein is written in silver letters , the name , degree , and office of that Loutea ,
