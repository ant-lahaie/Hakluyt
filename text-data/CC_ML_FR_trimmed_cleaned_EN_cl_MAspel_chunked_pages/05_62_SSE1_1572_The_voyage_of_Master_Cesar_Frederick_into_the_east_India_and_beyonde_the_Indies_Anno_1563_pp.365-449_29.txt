mountain which divides the territory of Ancola and Dialcan , I being a little behind my company , was assaulted by eight thieves , foure of them had swords and targets , and the other foure had bows and arrows . 389 Foure small forts of the Portugals . When the Falchines that carried me understood the noise of the assault , they let the pallanchine and me fallen to the ground , and ran away and left me alone , with my clothes wrapped about me : presently the thieves were on my neck and rifling me , they stripped me stark naked , and I feigned my self sick , because I would not leave the pallanchine , and I had made me a little bed of my clothes ; the thieves sought it very narrowly and subtly , and found two purses that I had , well bound up together , wherein I had put my Copper money which I had changed for foure pagodies in Ancola . The thieves thinking it had been so many ducats of gold , searched no further : then they threw all my clothes in a bush , and hied them away , and as God would have it , at their departure there fell from them and handkerchief , and when I saw it , I rose from my pallanchine or couch , and took it up , and wrapped it together within my pallanchine . Then these my Falchines were of so good condition , that they returned to seek me , whereas I thought I should not have found so much goodness in them : because they were paid their money aforehand , as is the use , I had thought to have seen them no more . Before their coming I was determined to pluck the Cane wherein my jewels were hidden , out of my couch , and to have mad6 me a walking stafFe to carry in my hand to Goa , thinking that I should have gone thither on foot , but by the faithfulness of my Falchines , I was rid of that trouble ,
