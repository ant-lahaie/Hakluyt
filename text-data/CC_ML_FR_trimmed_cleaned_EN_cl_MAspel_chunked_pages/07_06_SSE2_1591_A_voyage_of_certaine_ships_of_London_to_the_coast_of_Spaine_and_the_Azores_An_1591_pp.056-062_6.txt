kings further pleasure therein to be known . These Pataches are said to be of 300 tons the piece , and to carry 30 pieces of brass , and also of sail reported to have the advantage of any shipping . There perished of the Indies Fleet sunk in the sea before their coming to Flores 11 sails , whereof the General was one , and not one man saved . And it is by the Spaniards themselves presupposed that the storms which we had at Flores & at Tercera have devoured many more of them , whereof in part we were eye witnesses . And so what by the seas and our men of war I presume that of 75 sails that came from Havana , half of them will never arrive in Spaine . The 11 day of October at night we came to anchor in the found of Plimouth , and the next morning with our Prize came into Cattewater : for which God be thanked : for that a vehement storm arose , and with such fury increased , as that the Prize was forced to cut over her main mast : otherwise with the violence of the storm , her ground tackle being bad , she had driven on shore : which was the most cause that moved me to put in here ; intending now here to discharge the goods without further adventure , and have certified thus much unto my Lord Admiral , and therewith also desired to understand the direction of the Lords of the Counsel together with yours , insomuch as my Lord Thomas Howard is not returned . How the rest of our consorts which were separated from us by weather have sped , or what Prizes they have taken , whereof there is much hope by reason of the scattering of the West Indian Fleet , as yet we are able to say nothing . And thus expecting your answer , and for all other matters referring me unto the bearer Captain Furtho , I end . Plymouth the 24 of October . 1591 . Your worships loving friend Robert Flicke .
