good justice at the kings hands , and all other things that they wanted , or 56 could crave for the furnishing of their ships , took their leave of him , and of the rest of their friends , that were resident in Alger , and put out to Sea , looking to meet with the second army of the Spanish king , which waited for them about the mouth of the Straights of Gibraltar , which they were of necessity to pass . But coming near to the said Straight , it pleased God to raise at that instant a very dark and misty fog , so that one ship could not discern another , if it were 40 . paces off : by means whereof , together with the notable fair Eastern winds that then blew most fit for their course , they passed with great speed through the Straight , and might have passed with that good gale , had there be 500 . Galleys to withstand them , and the air never so clear for every ship to be seen . But yet the Spanish The second Galleys had a sighed of them when they were come within 3 . English miles of the town , and made after them in all possible haste , and although they saw that they were English . far out of their reach , yet in a vain fury and foolish pride , they shot off their Ordinance , and made a stir in the Sea as if they had be in the midst of them , which vanity of theirs ministered to our men notable matter of pleasure and mirth , seeing men to fight with shadows , and to take so great pains to so small purpose . But thus it pleased God to deride , and delude all the forces of that proud Spanish king , which he had provided of purpose to distress the English , who notwithstanding passed through both his Armies , in the one , little hurt , and in the other nothing touched , ' to the glory of his immortali Name , the honour of our Prince and Country , and the just commendation of each men service performed in that voyage .
