revolutions there are above their Horizon that dwell under the pole , which amount to 182 , and so many of our days the Sun continueth with them . During which time they have there continual day and light , without any hindrance of moist nights . Yet it is to be noted , that the Sun being in the first degree of Aries , and last degree of Virgo , makes his revolution in the very horizon , so that in these 24 hours half the body of the Sun is above the horizon , and the other half is under his only centre , describing both the horizon and the equinoctial circle . And therefore seeing the greatest declination of the Sun is almost 24 degrees , it follows , his greatest height in those countries ' to be almost 24 degrees . And so high is the Sun at noon to us in London about the 29 of October , being in the 15 degree of Scorpio , and likewise the 21 of January being in the 15 of Aquarius . Therefore look what force the Sun at noon hath in 272 London the 29 of October , the same force of heat it London . hath , to them that dwell under the pole , the space almost of two months , during the time of the Summer solstitium , and that without intermingling of any cold night ; so that if the heat of the Sun at noon could be well measured in London ( which is very hard to do , because of the long nights which engender great moisture and cold ) then would manifestly appear by express numbers the manner of the heat under the poles , which certainly must needs be to the inhabitants very commodious and profitable , if it incline not to overmuch heat , and if moisture do not want . For as in October in England we find temperate air , and have in our gardens herbs and flowers notwithstanding our cold1 nights , how much more should they have the same good air , being continual without
