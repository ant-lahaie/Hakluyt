violated between us and you and mutually between the subject ' s of us both , may be put in perpetuali ure and obtain full strength in time to come , since hereupon ( by Gods assistance ) it is to be hoped , that unspeakable commodity and quiet will redound unto both parts : may it seem good unto your discretion , as it seems expedient unto us , that some messengers of yours sufficiently authorised to parley , agree , and conclude with our deputy , about the mutual contraction of a perpetuali league and confirmation of friendship , may with all convenient speed be sent unto our presence . At whose arrival , not only in this business so profitable and behooveful , but also in certain other affairs concerning the former treaties and conclusions , they may , yea and of necessity must greatly avail . Wherefore ( our entirely beloved friend ) even as upon confidence of the premises we have thought good to grant unto the merchants and subject ' s of our realm hill authority to resort unto your dominions , so we do in like manner grant unto your merchants and subject ' s free [ licence and liberty with their merchandises and goods securely to come into our realms and dominions , there to stay , and at their pleasures thence to return home . Moreover , if Arnold Dassel , who last of all presented your foresaid letters n 97 g A motion for a perpetuali league . unto us , shall think good in the mean season to make his abided here in our dominions ( as in very deed it is expedient ) he may both by serious consideration and deliberate consulting with our commissioners more conveniently and prosperously find out ways and means , for the more speedy expedition of all the premises . Fare you well in Christ .
