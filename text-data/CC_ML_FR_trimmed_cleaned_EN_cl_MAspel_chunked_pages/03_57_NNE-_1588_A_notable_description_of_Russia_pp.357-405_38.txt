, the people burning in their houses and streets , but most of all of such as laboured to pass out of the gates farthest from the enemy , where meeting together in a mighty throng , & so pressing every man to prevent another , wedged themselves so fast within the gate , and streets near unto it , as that three ranks walked one upon the others head , the uppermost treading down those that were lower : so that there perished at that time ( as was said ) by the fire & the press , the number of 800000 people or more .

And this homage ( they say ) was done till the time of Basileus grandfather to this man . Who surprising the Chrim Emperor by a stratagem done by one of his nobility ( called Ivan Demetro - wich Belschey ) was content with this ransom , viz . with the changing of this homage into a tribute of furs : which afterwards also was denied to be paid by this Emperor ' s father . Hereupon they continue you quarrel , the Russe defending his country , & that which he hath wone , you
