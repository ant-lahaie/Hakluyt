as we could to pass the promontory , but in all that gulf , & in all the way beside , we found so often calms , that the expertest mariners wondered at it . And in places where are always wont to be most horrible tempests , we found most quiet calms which was very troublesome to those ships which be the greatest of all other , and cannot go without good winds . Insomuch , that when it is tempest almost intolerable for other ships , and makes them main all their sails , these hoist up , and sail excellent well , unless the waters be too too furious , which seidome happened in our navigation . You shall understand , that being passed the line , they cannot straightway go the next way to the promontory : but according to the wind , they draw always as near South as they can to put themselves in the latitude of the point , which is 35 degrees and and half , and then they take their course towards the East , and so compass the point .

You know that it is hard to sail from East to West , or contrary , because there is no fixed point in all the sky , whereby they may direct their course , wherefore I shall tell you what helps God provided for these men .
