no doubt but he will be brought to tribute with great gladness , if not , he hath neither shot nor iron weapon in all his Empire , and therefore may easily be conquered . And I farther remember that Berreo confessed to me and others ( which I protest before the Majesty of God to be true ) that there was found among prophecies in Peru ( at such time as the Empire was reduced to the Spanish obedience ) in their chiefest temples , among diverse others which foreshowed the loss of the said Empire , that from Inglatierra those Ingas should be again in time to come restored , and delivered from the servitude of the said Conquerors . And I hope , as we with these few hands have displanted the first garrison , and driven them out of the said country , so her Majesty will give order for the rest , and either defend it , and hold it as tributary , or conquer and keep it as Empress of the same . For whatsoever Prince shall possess it , shall be greatest , and if the king , of Spaine enjoy it , he will become unresistable . Her Majesty hereby shall confirm and strengthen the opinions of all nations , as touching her great and princely actions . And where the South border of Guiana reaches to the Dominion and Empire of the Amazones , those women shall hereby hear the name of a virgin , which is not only able to defend her own territories and her neighbours , but also to invade and conquer so great Empires and so far removed . To speak more at this time , I fear would be but troublesome : I trust in God , this being true , will suffice , and that he which is King of all Kings and Lord of Lords , will put it into her heart which is Lady of Ladies to possess it , if not , I will judge those men worthy to be kings thereof , that by her grace and leave will undertake it of themselves .
