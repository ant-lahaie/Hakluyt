that sudden approach of Winter , bringing with it continual fog , and thick . mists , tempest and rage of weather ; also contrariety of currents descending from the cape of Florida unto cape Briton and cape Raze , would fallen out to be great and irresistible impediments unto our further proceeding for that year , and compel us to Winter in those North and cold regions . Wherefore suppressing all objections to the contrary , we resolved to begin our course Northward , and to follow directly as we might , the trade way unto Newfoundland : 42 from whence after our refreshing and reparation of wants , we intended without delay ( by Gods permission ) to proceed into the South , not omitting any river or bay which in all that large tract of land appeared to our view worthy of search . Immediately we agreed upon the manner of our course and order to be observed in our voyage ; which were delivered in writing unto the captains and master ' s of every ship a copy in manner following . Every ship had delivered two bullets or scrolls , the one sealed up in wax , the other left open : in both which were included several watchwords . That open , serving upon our own coast or the coast of Ireland : the other sealed , was promised on all hands not to be broken up until we should be clear of the Irish coast ; which from thenceforth did serve until we arrived and met altogether in such harbors of the Newfoundland as were agreed for our Rendez vouz . The said watchwords being requisite to know our consorts whensoever by night , either by fortune of weather , our fleet dispersed should come together again ; or one should hale another ; or if by ill watch and steerage one ship should chance to fallen aboard of another in the dark . The reason of the bullet sealed was to keep secret that watchword while we were upon our own coast , lest any of the company stealing from the fleet might bewray the same : which known to and enemy , he might board us by night without mistrust , having our own watchword .
