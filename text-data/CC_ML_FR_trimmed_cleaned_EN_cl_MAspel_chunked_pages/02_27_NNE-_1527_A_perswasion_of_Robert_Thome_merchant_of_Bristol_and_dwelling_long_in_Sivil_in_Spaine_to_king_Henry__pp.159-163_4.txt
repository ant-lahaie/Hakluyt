of the mariners , to choose whither they will sail by the coasts , that be cold , temperate or hight . For they being passed the Pole , it is plain , they may decline to what part they list . 162 If they will go towards the Orient , they shall enjoy Tartaria . the regions of all the Tartarians that extend towards the midday , and from thence they may go and proceed to the land of the Chinas , and from thence to China . the land of Cathaio Orientali , which is of all the main land most Orientali that can be reckoned from our habitation . And if from thence they do continue their navigation , following the coasts that return towards the Occident , they shall fallen in with Malaca , and so with all the Indies which we call Orientali , and following the way , may return hither by the Cape of Buona Speransa : and thus they shall compass the whole world . And if they will take their course after they be passed the Pole , towards the Occident , they shall go in the back side of the new found land , which Newfound of late was discovered by your Graces subject ' s , until land they come to the back side and South Seas of the Indies Occidentali . And so continuing their voyage they may return thorough the straight of Magellan to this country , and so they compass also the world by that way : and if they go this third way , and after they be passed the Pole , go right towards the Pole Antarctike , and then decline towards the lands and Islands situated between the Tropikes , and under the Equinoctial ! , without doubt they shall find there the richest lands and Islands of the world of gold , precious stones , balms , spices , and other things that we here esteem most : which come out of strange countries , and may return the same way . By this it appears , your Grace hath not only a great advantage of the riches , but also your subject ' s shall not travel half of the way that other doe , which go round about as aforesaid .
