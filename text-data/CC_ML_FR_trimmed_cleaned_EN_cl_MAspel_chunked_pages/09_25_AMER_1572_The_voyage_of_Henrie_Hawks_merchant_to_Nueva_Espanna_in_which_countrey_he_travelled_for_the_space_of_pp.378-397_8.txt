will be as well sodden as it will be over a fire in half a day . I have seen half a sheep 384 cast in , and immediately it hath be sodden , and I have eaten part of it . There are many hares , and some conies . There are no partridges , but abundance of quails . They have great store of fish in the South sea , and many oysters , and very great . The people do open the oysters , and take out the meat of them , and dry it as they do any other kind of fish , and keep them all the year : and when the times serve , they send them abroad into the country to fell , as all other fish . They have no salmon , nor trowt , nor peel , nor carp , tench , nor pike in all the country . There are in the country mighty high mountains , and hills , and snow upon them : they commonly burn ; and twice every day they cast out much smoke and ashes at certain open places , which are in the tops of them . There is among the wild people much manna . I have gathered of the same , and have eaten it , and it is good : for the Apothecaries send their servants at certain times , to gather of the same for purgations , and other uses . There are in the mountains many wild hogs , which all men may kill , and lions and tigers ; which tigers do much harm to men that travel in the wilderness . In this country , not long since , there were two poor men that found a marvellous rich mine ; and when these men went to make a register of the same ( according to the law and custom ) before the kings officers , they thought this mine not meet for such men as they were : and violently took the said mine for the king ; and gave no part thereof unto the two poor men .
