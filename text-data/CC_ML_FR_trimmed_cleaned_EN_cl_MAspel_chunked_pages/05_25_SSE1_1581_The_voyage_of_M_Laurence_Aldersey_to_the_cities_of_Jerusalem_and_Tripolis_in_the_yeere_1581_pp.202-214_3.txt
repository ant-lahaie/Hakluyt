yet receive the New Testament . This City of Venice is very fair , and greatly to be commended , wherein is good order for all things : and also it is very strong and populous : it stands upon the main Sea , and hath many Islands about it , that belong to it . To tell you of the duke of Venice , and of the Signiory : there is one chosen that ever bears the name of a duke , but in truth he is but servant to the Signiory , for of himself he can do little : it is not otherwise with him , then with a Priest that is at Mass upon a festival day , which putting on his golden garment , seems to be a great man , but if any man come unto him , and crave some friendship at his hands , he will say , you must go to the Master ' s of the Parish , for I can not pleasure you , otherwise then by preferring of your suit : and so it is with the duke of Venice , if any man having a suit , come to him , and make his complaint , and deliver his supplication , it is not in him to help him , but he will tell him , You must come this day , or that day , and then I will prefer your suit to the Signiory , and do you the best friendship that I may . Furthermore , if any man bring a letter unto him , he may not open it , but in the presence of the Signiory , and they are to see it first , which being read , perhaps they will deliver it to him , perhaps not . Of the Signiory there be about three hundreth , and about fourtie of the privy Counsel of Venice , who usually are arrayed in gowns of crimson Satin , or crimson Damask , when they fit in Counsel . In the City of Venice , no man may wear a weapon , except he be a soldier for the Signiory ,
