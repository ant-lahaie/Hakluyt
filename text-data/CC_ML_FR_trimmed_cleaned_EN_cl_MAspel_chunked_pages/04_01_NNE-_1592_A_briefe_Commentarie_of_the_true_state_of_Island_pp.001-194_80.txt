up , the buildings whereof do resemble that ancient excellency , the houses being very large , both in breadth and length , and for the most part in height also . As for example : farms or granges which contain chambers in them , more then fiftie cubits in length , tenne in breadth , and twentie in height . And so other rooms , as a parlour , a stove , a buttery , etc . answering in proportion unto the former . I could here name many of our country buildings both large and wide , neither ilfavoured in show , nor base in regard of their workmanship and costly firmness or strength , with certain Churches also , or religious houses built of timber only , according to ancient and artificiali seemeli - nesse and beauty : as the Cathedral Church of Holen having a body the five pillars whereof on both sides be foure elnes high , and about five elnes thick , as also beams and weather - bourdes , and the rest of the roof iv 161 L proportionally answering to this lower building . Our most gracious King Lord Frederick , whose memory is most sacred unto us , in the year 1588 . did most liberally bestow timber for the re - edifying of this body being cast down in the year 1584 . by and horrible tempest . But the Church it self does manifestly exceed the body thereof in all quantity : also the inner part of the Church , which is commonly called the quire is somewhat less , both then the middle part of the Church , and also then the body . The Church of Schalholt was far greater as I have herd in old time , then this our Cathedral , which having now been twice burned , is brought to a lesser scantling . Likewise there be some other Churches of our Hand , although not matching , yet resembling the ancient magnificence of these . For here the matter seems not to require that I should run into a long description of these things
