In the new city is the palace of the king , and his abiding place with all his barons and nobles , and other gentlemen ; and in the time that I was there , they finished the building of the new city : it is a great city , very plain and flat , and foure square , walled round about and with ditches that compass the walls about with water , in which ditches are many crocodiles , it hath no draw bridges , yet it hath twentie gates , five for every square on the walls , there are many places made for centinels to watch , made of wood and covered or gilded with gold , the streets 420 thereof are the fairest that I have seen , they are as straight as a line from one gate to another , and standing at the one gate you may discover to the other , and they are as broad as 10 or 12 men may ride a breast in them : and those streets that be thwart are fair and large , these streets , both on the one side and on the other , are planted at the doors of the houses , with nut trees of India , which make a very commodious shadow , the houses be made of wood and covered with a kind of tiles in form
