' of Ava , Langeiannes , Siam , and the Bramas , the men wear bunches or little round balls in their privy members : some of them wear two and some three . They cut the skin and so put them in , one into one side and another into the other side ; which they do when they be 25 or 30 years old , and at their pleasure they take one or more of them out as they think good . When they be married the husband is for every child which his wife hath , to put in one until he come to three and then no more : for they say the women do desire them . They were invented because they should not abuse the male sex . For in times passed all those countries were so given to that villainy , that they were very scarce of people . It was also ordained that the women should not have passed three cubits of cloth in their neither clothes , which they bind about them ; which are so strait , that when they go in the streets , they show one side of the leg bore above the knee . The bunches aforesaid be of diverse sorts : the least be as big as a little walnut , and very round : the greatest are as big as a little hens egg : 496 1583 - 91 ' some are of brass and some of silver : but those of silver be for the king and his noble men . These are gilded and made with great cunning , and ring like a little bell . There are some made of lead , which they call Selwy because they ring but little : and these be of lesser price for the poorer sort . The king sometime takes his out , and gives them to his noblemen as a great gift : and because he hath used them , they esteem them greatly . They will put one in , and heal up the place in seven or eight days . The Bramas
