world between them two . And that all that should be discovered from Cape Verde , where this Carded begins to be counted in the degrees of longitude , to 180 of the said scale of longitude , which is half the world towards the Orient , & finisheth in this Carded right over against a little cross made at the said 180 degrees , to be 173 The longitudes hard to be found out . the king of Portingals . And all the land from the said Cross toward the Occident , until it joineth with the other Cross in the Orient , which containeth the other hundreth and eightie degrees , that is the other half of the world , to be the king of Spaines . So that from the land over against the said hundreth & eighty degrees until it finish in the three hundred and sixtie on both the ends of the Carded , is the jurisdiction of the king of Spaine . So after this manner they divided the world between them . Now for that these Islands of Spicery fallen near the term and limits between these princes ( for as by the said Carded you may see they begin from one hundred and sixtie degrees of longitude , and end in 215 ) it seems all that falls from 160 to 180 degrees , should be of Portingal : and all the rest of Spaine . And for that their Cosmographers and Pilots could not agree in the situation of the said Islands ( for the Portingals set them all within their 180 degrees , and the Spaniards set them all without : ) and for that in measuring , all the Cosmographers of both parts , or what other that ever have be cannot give certain order to measure the longitude of the world , as they do of the latitude : for that there is no star fixed from East to West , as are the stars of the Poles from North to South , but all moveth with the moving divine : no manner can be found how certainly it may be measured , but by
