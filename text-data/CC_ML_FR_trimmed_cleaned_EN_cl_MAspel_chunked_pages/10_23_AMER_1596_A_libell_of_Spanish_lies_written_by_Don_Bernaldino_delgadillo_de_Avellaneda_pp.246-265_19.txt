. And this is a true discourse of our fight with the Spanish fleet . The which the author hereof will justify with the adventure of his life , against any Spaniarde serving in that actium , that shall contradict the same . Henry Savile . Thomas Baskervil knight , his approbation to the former twofold discourse of Captain Savile . Thomas Baskervill knight , general ot her Majesties late Indian armada in the late conflict had between the Spanish fleet and us , having perused the Spanish letter written by DONE Bernaldino Delgadillo de Avellaneda , general of the king of Spaines Navy , and also having perused captain Henrie Savile his answers unto the sixe exceptions in the Generals letter , with his discourse of the manner of our fight with the Spanish fleet , do say that the said Henrie Savile hath answered the letter , and set down the order of the fight sincerely according to truth , for testimony of which I have hereunto set my hand . 264 And if DONE Bernaldino Delgadillo de Avellaneda the general shall take any exceptions to this my approbation , or stand in the justification of his lying letter written to Doctor Peter Florez , President of the Contractation house for the Indies , and by him for Bernaldinos glory lately put in print : I then say that he falsely lied , and that I will maintain against him with whatsoever arms he shall make choice of . And because the kingdomeS wherein we abide are enemies ( by reason of which there is no means in either of them , to maintain that I have written ) let him make choice of any indifferent kingdom of equal distance from either realm , and I will there be ready to maintain as much as I have written : But if by my employments into France I be so stayed by her Majesties commandments , that I cannot out of that realm meet him in any other , I cannot see why he should take any exception to that , considering the equality of the place , and that the Armies of both our princes be there resident . Thomas Baskervile .
