, which the trees yield great store of ; and wherewith the women make a fine thread , which will make excellent good fustians or stockings . Great store of pitch , diverse sorts of sweet gums , & West Indian pepper , balsamum , parrots and monkeys . Beside diverse other commodities , which in good time may be found out to the benefit of our 1597 - countrey , and profit of the adventurers , who as yet having ventured much , have gained little . Now leaving the river of Cori tine , passing by Saint Vincent , Santa Lucia , and Matalina , we came to Dominica upon the Friday following , being the thirteenth of May , having lost the bark that came out with us the Wednes - Tty ty ty - day before . Upon Sunday morning , the fifteenth of tn May , we came to Guadalupe , where we watered at ” ° the Souther part of the Island , and having done by night , we set sail , and stood away to the Northward , but were becalmed all night , and until tenne of the clock on Munday night : at which time having a fair gale at East , and after at Southeast , we passed along in the sighed of Monserate , Antigua , and Barbuda . Upon the ninth of June , being Thursday , we made the Islands of Flores and Corvo : and the eight and twentieth of June we made the Lisart , and that night came all safe to Plymmouth , blessed be God . Between the Isle of Barbuda in the West Indies and England we had three mighty storms , many calms , and some contrary winds . And upon the foureteenth of June 1597 , there being diverse whale ' s playing about our pinnace , one of them crossed our stem , and going under , rubbed her back against our keel : but by none of all these we sustained any loss .
