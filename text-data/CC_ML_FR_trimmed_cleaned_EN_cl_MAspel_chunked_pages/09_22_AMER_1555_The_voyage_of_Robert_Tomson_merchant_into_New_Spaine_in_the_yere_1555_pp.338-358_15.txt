misery and infamy to the world , should be provided at Gods hand in one moment , of more then in all my life before I could attain unto by my own labour . After we departed from Mexico , our S . Benitoes were set up in the high Church of the said City , with our names written in the same , according to their use and custom , which is and will be a monument and a remembrance of us , as long as the Romish Church does reign in that country . The same have be seen since by one John Chilton , and diverse others of our nation , which were left in that country long since , by Sir John Hawkins . And because it shall known wherefore it was 35 Â° that I was so punished by the Clergies hand , as before is mentioned , I will in brief words declare the same . It is so , that being in Mexico at the table , among many principali people at dinner , they began to inquire of me being and Englishman , whither it were true , that in England they had overthrown all their Churches and houses of Religion , and that all the images of the Saints of heaven that were in them were thrown down , broken , and burned , and in some places high ways stoned with them , and whither the English nation denied their obedience to the Pope of Rome , as they had be certified out of Spaine by their friends . To whom I made answer , that it was so , that in deed they had in England put down all the Religious houses of friars and monks that were in England , and the images that were in their Churches and other places were taken away , and used there no more : for that ( as they say ) the making of them , and putting of them where they were adored , was clean contrary to the express commandment of Almighty God , Thou shalt not make to thy self any graved image , etc .
