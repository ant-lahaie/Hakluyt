where the North pole is elevated 20 degrees 30 min . And the Crociers being the guards of the South pole , be raised 9 degrees 30 min . The said Crociers be 4 stars , representing the form of a cross , and be 30 degrees in latitude from the South pole : and the lowest star of the said Crociers is to be taken , when it is directly under the uppermost ; and being so taken as many degrees as it wants of 30 , so many you are to the Northwards of the Equinoctial : and as many degrees as be more then 30 , so many degrees you are to the Southwards of the Equinoctial .
