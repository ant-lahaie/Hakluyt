is there to be seen in the crevice , wherein a man may put his arm . 211 S . Helens chapel . Upon the other side of the mount of Calvarie is the place where Abraham would have sacrificed his son . Where also is a chapel , and the place paved with stones of diverse colours . There is also the house of Annas the high Priest , and the Olive tree whereunto Christ was bound when he was whipped . Also the house of Caiphas , and by it the prison where Christ was kept , which is but the room of one man , and hath no light but the opening of the door . Without Jerusalem in the valley of Josaphat is a church under the ground , like to the shrouds in Pauls , where the sepulchre of the virgin Marry is : the stairs be very broad , and upon the stairs going down are two sepulchres : upon the left hand lies Josaphat , and upon the right hand lies Joachim and Anna , the father and mother of the virgin Marry . Going out of the valley of Josaphat we came to mount Olivet , where Christ prayed unto his father before his death : and there is to be seen ( as they told me ) the water & blood that fell from the eyes of Christ . A little higher upon the same mount is the place where the Apostles slept , and watched not . At the foot of the mount is the place where Christ was imprisoned . Upon the mountain also is the place where Christ stood when he wept over Jerusalem , and where he ascended into heaven . Now having seen all these monuments , I with my company set from Jerusalem , the 20 day of August , and came again to Joppa the 22 of the same month , where we took shipping presently for Tripolis , and in foure days we came to Mecina the place where the ships lie that come for Tripolis . The city of Tripolis is a mile and a half within the land ,
