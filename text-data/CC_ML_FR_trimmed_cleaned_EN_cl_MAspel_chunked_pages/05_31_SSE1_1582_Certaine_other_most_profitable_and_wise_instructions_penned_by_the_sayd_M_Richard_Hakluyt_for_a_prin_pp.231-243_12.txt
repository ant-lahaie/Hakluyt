have degenerated by reason of the cold climate , some other things brought in have by negligence be lost . The Archbishop of Canterbury Edmund Grindall , after he returned out of Germany , brought into this realm the plant of Tamariske from thence , and this plant he hath so increased that there be here thousands of them ; and many people have received great health by this plant : and if of things brought in such care were had , then could not the first labour be lost . The seed of Tobacco hath be brought hither out of the West Indies , it grows here , and with the herb many have be eased of the reumes , etc . Each one of a great number of things were worthy of a journey to be made into Spaine , Italy , Barbarie , Egypt , Zante , Constantinople , the West Indies , and to diverse other places nearer and further ofF then any of these , yet forasmuch as the poor are not able , and for that the rich settled at home in quiet will not , therefore we are to make suit to such as repair to foreign kingdoms , for other businesses , to have some care herein , and to set before their eyes the examples of these good men , and to endeavour to do for their parts the like , as their speciali businesses may permit the same . Thus giving you occasion by way of a little remembrance , to have a desire to do your country good , you shall , if you have any inclination to such good , do more good to the poor ready to starve for relief , then ever any subject did in this realm by building of Almshouses , and by giving of lands and goods to the relief of the poor . Thus may you help to drive idleness the mother of most mischiefs out 242 WILLIAM HAREBORNE â€™ S AMBASSAGE a . d . . 1583 - of the realm , and win you perpetuali fame , and the prayer of the poor , which is more worth then all the gold of Peru and of all the West Indies .
