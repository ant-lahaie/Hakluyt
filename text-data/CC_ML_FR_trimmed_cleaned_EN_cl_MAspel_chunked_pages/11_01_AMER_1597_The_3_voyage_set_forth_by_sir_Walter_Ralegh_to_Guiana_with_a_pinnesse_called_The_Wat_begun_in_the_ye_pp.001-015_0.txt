That day we descried a sail , which at length we found to be a flyboat of Dartmouth , of 200 . tons , bound to the Island of Mayo for salt . we fell in consort with her , and that night stood for the Southermost part of the Island there to water , where we stayed all the next day , and watered at the Southsouthwest part thereof .
