Then I traveled on further unto a Or , Sum / tania . city called * Soldania , wherein the Persian Emperor lies all Summer time : but in winter he takes his progress The Caspian unto another city standing upon the Sea called * Baku . sea - Also the foresaid city is very great and cold , having good and wholesome waters therein , unto the which also store of merchandise is brought . Moreover I traveled with a certain company of Caravans towards upper India : and in the way , after many days journey , I came unto Or , Cassibin . the city of the three wise men called * Cassan , which is a noble and renowned city , saving that the Tartars have destroyed a great part thereof , and it aboundeth with bred , wine , and many other commodities . From this city unto Jerusalem ( whither the three foresaid wisemen were miraculously led ) it is fiftie days journey . There be many wonders in this city also , which , for brevities sake , I omit . From thence I departed unto a certain Geste . city called * Geste , whence the Sea of Sand is distant , one days journey , which is a most wonderful and dangerous thing . In this city there is abundance of all kinds of victuals , and especially of figs , reisins , and grapes ; more ( as I suppose ) then in any part of the whole world beside . This is one of the three principali cities in all the Persian Empire . Of this city the Saracens report , that no Christian can by any means live therein above a year .

In it there are stately palaces altogether destitute of inhabitants , notwithstanding
