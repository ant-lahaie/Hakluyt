prince and Realm must needs in time decay . The strangeness of the place is such for sundry things 1 see , As if I would I cannot write each private point to thee . The cold is rare , the people rude , the prince so full of pride , The Realm so stored with Monks and nuns , and priests on every side : T34 The manners are so Turkey like , the men so full of guile , The women wanton , Temples stuffed with idols that defile The Seats that sacred ought to be , the customs are so quaint , As if I would describe the whole , I fear my pen would feint . In sum , I say I never saw a prince that so did reign , Nor people so beset with Saints , yet all but vile and vain . Wild Irish are as civil as the Russies in their kind , Hard choice which is the best of both , each bloody , rude and blind . If thou be wise , as wise thou art , and wilt be ruled by me , Live still at home , and covet not those barbarous coasts to see . No good befalls a man that seeks , and finds no better place , No civil customs to be learned , where God bestows no grace . And truly ill they do deserve to be belov â€™ d of God , That neither love nor stand in awe of his assured rod : Which though be long , yet plagues at last the vile and beastly sort Of sinful wights , that all in vice do place their chiefest sport . A dieu friend Parker , if thou list , to know the Russes well , To Sigismundus book repair , who all the truth can tell : For he long erst in message went unto that savage King , Sent by the Pole , and true report in each respect did bring , To him I recommend my self , to ease my pen of pain , And now at last do wish thee well , and bid farewell again .
