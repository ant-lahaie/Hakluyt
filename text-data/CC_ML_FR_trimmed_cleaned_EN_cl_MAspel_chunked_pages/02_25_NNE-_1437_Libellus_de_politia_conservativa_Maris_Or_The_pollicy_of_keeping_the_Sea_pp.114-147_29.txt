God pleasance : And peace after the werres variance . The end of battle is peace sickerly , And power causeth peace finally . Kept than the sea about in speciali , Which of England is the town wall . As though England were likened to a city , And the wall environ were the see . Keep then the sea that is the wall of England : And than is England kept by Goddes hand ; That as for any thing that is without , England were at ease withouten doubt , And thus should every land one with another Entercommon , as brother with his brother , And live together werrelesse in unity , Without rancour in very charity , In rest and peace , to Christes great pleasance , Without strife , debate and variance . Which peace men should enserche with business , And knit it saddely holding in holiness . The Apostle sayeth , if you list to see , be ye busy for to keep unity Of the spirit in the bound of peace . Which is needful to all withouten less . The Prophet bids us peace for to inquire To pursue it , this is holy desire . n i4S K A .

God give us grace , the ways for to keep Of his precepts , and slugly not to sleep In shame of sin : that our very foe Might be to us converse , and turned so . Cum placuerint Domino vice hominis ejus inimicos ad pacem convertet . For in the Proverbs is a text to this purpose Plain enough
