paint their faces withal , and delight themselves much to see them of fowl women to become such fair images . This parcheth the skin , and helpeth to deform them when their painting is of . They apparel themselves after the Greek manner . The Nobleman ' s attire is on this fashion . First a Taffia , or little night cap on his head , that covereth little more then his crown , commonly very rich wrought of silk and gold thread , and set with pearl and precious stone . His head he keepeth shaved close to the very skin , except he be in some displeasure with the 416 Emperor . Then he suffers his hair to grow and hang down upon his shoulders , covering his face as ugly and deformedly as he can . Over the Taffia he weareth a wide cap of black Fox ( which they account for the best fur ) with a Tiara or long bonnet put within it , standing up like a Persian or Babylonian hat . About his neck ( which is seen all bore ) is a collar set with pearl and precious stone , about three or foure fingers broad . Next over his shirt , ( which is curiously wrought , because he strippeth himself into it in the Summer time , while he is within the house ) is a Shepon , or light garment of silk , made down to the knees , buttoned before : and then a Caftan or a close coat buttoned , and girded to him with a Persian girdle , whereat he hangs his knives and spoon . This commonly is of cloth of gold , and hangs down as low as his ankles . Over that he weareth a loose garment of some rich silk , furred and faced about with some gold lace , called a Ferris . Another over that of chamlet , or like stuff called and Alkaben , sleeved and hanging low , and the cape commonly brooched , and set all with pearl . When he goes abroad , he casts over all these ( which are but sleight , though they seem to be many ) and other garment called and Honoratkey , like to the Alkaben , save that it is made without a collar for the neck . And this is commonly of fine cloth ,
