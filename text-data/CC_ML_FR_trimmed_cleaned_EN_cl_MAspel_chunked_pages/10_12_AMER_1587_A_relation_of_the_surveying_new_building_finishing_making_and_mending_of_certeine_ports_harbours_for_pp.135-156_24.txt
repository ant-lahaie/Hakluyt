may be first unladen in Puerto Bello , and there to built a little castle in the mouth of the said river , and at the foot of the castle to built a storehouse to unladen and keep all the said goods , and there to built other barks of less burden : then these would serve for Summer , and the great barks for the Winter . If it would please your majesty , there might a very good high way be made on the one side of the river , and so they might be towed , for it may be made and not with much cost because it is all plain ground , and there is growing upon the said river great store of timber and trees which do lie over - thwart the said River ; so that they are very cumbersome and great annoyance unto the said boats , aswell those 155 that go up the said River , as also that do come down the said River . And therefore if it might please your majesty to command , that Puerto Bello might be inhabited , and the town made nearer the Rivers side , every thing would be a great deal better cheap , if the commodities were carried up the River : for it is a great danger to carry them up by land , for it is daily seen that the mules do many times fallen and break their necks with their lading upon their backs , as well the treasure as other kind of commodities , because it is such a bad way . And your majesty might be at this charges and spend your revenues of Number de Dios and Panama , which do yearly yield 12 or 14 thousand pezos , & this being once done it would be a great aid and benefit to those , which do trade and traffic , and to those merchants which do send their goods overland , and ease them much of pain and purse , because the - other is a most filthy way , as any is in the world .
