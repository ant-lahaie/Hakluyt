the land of Chilao which is between the firm land and the Hand Manor : and going from the Indies to the coast of Coromandel , they lose some ships , but they be empty , because that the ships that pass that way discharge their goods at and Hand called Peripatane , and there land their goods into small flat bottomed boats which draw little water , and are called Taken , and can run over every Should without either danger or loss of any thing , for that they tarry in Peripatane until such time as it be fair weather . Before they depart to pass the Sholdes , the small ships and flat bottomed boats go together in company , and when they have sailed sixe and thirtie miles , they arrive at the place where the Sholdes are , and at that place the winds blow so forcibly , that they are forced to go thorough , not having any other refuge to save themselves . The flat bottomed boats go safe thorough , where as the small ships if they miss the aforesaid channel , stick fast on the Sholdes , and by this means many are lost : and coming back from the Indies , they go not that way , but pass by the channel of Manar as is abovesaid , whose channel is Oazy , and if the ships stick fast , it is great chance if there be any danger at all . The reason why this channel is not more sure to go thither , is , because the winds that reign or blow between Zeilan and Manar , make the channel so shallow with water , that almost there is not any passage . From Cao Comori to the Hand of Zeilan is 120 . miles overthwart . Zeilan . ZEilan is and Hand , in my judgement , a great deal bigger then Cyprus : on that side towards the Indies lying Westward is the city called Columba , which is a 398 1563 - 81 . hold of the Portugales , but without walls or enemies .
