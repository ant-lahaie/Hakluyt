these parts again . He willed us also himself to fit down before him the distance of a quoits cast from his tent , where he sat with diverse of his counsel and nobility , sending us from his table such meat as was before him : And after certain talk had with us , he said , if he might perceive or know any manner of person to do us any wrong , he would punish them in example of others , whereby we should live in quietness , and have no cause to complain , giving us a little house for the time , until a better might be provided in such place as we should think most meet , never willing us to rise or depart , until such time as we of our selves thought it convenient . At the taking of our leave , he willed us to put our whole minds and requests in writing , that he might further understand our desires . But while we were about to do so , God took this good king our friend out of this present life the 2 . of October past . The want of him hath be the cause that as yet we cannot receive certain debts . Howbeit , we doubt not but we shall recover all such sums of money as are owing us for this voyage . As for Thomas Alcocks debts they are passed hope of recovery , which had not be lost if the king had lived . We trust in the place of him , God will send as friendly a king towards us : who by report ( and as we be credibly informed , ) shall be his son nam the Mursay : who since the death of his father , at our being with him , promised to show us more friendship then ever we found : God grant the same . Great troubles have chanced in these parts . Of those which were of the old kings counsel or bore any rule about him in these quarters , some are in prison , some are pinched by the purse , and other sent for unto the Shaugh .
