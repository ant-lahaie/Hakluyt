Qprimis , when your bark with all furniture is ready , you shall at the beginning of the year ( assoon as you possibly may ) make your repair to the Eastern part of the river Pechora , where is and Island called Dolgoieve , and from thence you shall pass to the Eastwards alongst by the Sea coast of Hugorie , or the main land of 119 Pechora , and sailing alongst by the same coast , you shall pass within seven leagues of the Island Vaigats , which is in the straight , almost half way from the coast of Hugorie , unto the coast of Nova Zembla , which Island Vaigats and Nova Zembla you shall find noted in your plate , therefore you shall not need to discover it : but proceed on alongst the coast of Hugory , towards the river Obba . There is a Bay between the said Vaigats , and the river Obba , that does bite to the Southwards , into the land of Hugory , in which Bay are two small rivers , the one called Cara Reca , the other Naramsy , as in the paper of notes which are given to you herewith may appear : in the which Bay you shall not need to spend any time for searching of it , but to direct your course to the river Ob ( if otherwise you be not constrained to keep alongst the shore ) and when you come to the river Ob you shall not enter into it , but pass over unto the Eastern part of the mouth of the said river . And when you are at the Eastern part of the mouth of Obba Reca , you shall from thence pass
