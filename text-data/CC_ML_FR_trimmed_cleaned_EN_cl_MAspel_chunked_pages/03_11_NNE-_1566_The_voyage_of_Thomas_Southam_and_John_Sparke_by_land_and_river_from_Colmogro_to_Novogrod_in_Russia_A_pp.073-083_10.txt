carry it to the town of Some by Sleds , whereof you may there have 2000 . if you will , by the report of the Russes . For from Novogrod yearly there go many Sleds in the Winter to fetch salt from Some , with carriers and empty Sleds there to buy it , and to bring it to Novogrod to fell it in the market or otherwise . From Novogrod unto Some town you may have a pood of wares carried for eight pence or nine pence : but in any wise your wares must be sent from Novogrod by the sixt of January , so that the wares may be at Some by Candlemas , or soon after : for if your wares should tarry by the way until the 15 . of February when the Sun is of some power , then is it dangerous : for the heat of the Sun in the day causeth the deep lake ' s of Ladega , and specially of Onega to cleave : and if there should come then a sudden thaw , as oftentimes in that time of the year doth , then do . these lake ' s open and break , whereby many men are lost , and both men and 82 1566 . horse drowned , although other rivers do remain frozen a long time after . In the town of Some also there are many warehouses , whereof we cannot be destitute for the reposing of our wares , as also as many barks as you will to transport your wares from thence to S . Nicholas road , and that for three pence a poods carriage : so that from the Ci tie of Novogrod unto S . Nicholas road you may have wares carried for two all tines . The pood comes unto 23 . all tines the tun . Provided always , that you buy your wares there your Novgorod self , and send it thence : for there is no hope that the natives will bring their wares from Novogrod to Some , in hope to fell unto us , considering the great trade that they have at the Narve , which is within 180 miles off them .
