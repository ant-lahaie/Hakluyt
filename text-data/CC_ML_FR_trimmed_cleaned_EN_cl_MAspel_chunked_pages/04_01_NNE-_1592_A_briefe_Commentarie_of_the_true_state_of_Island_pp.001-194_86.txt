there be certain among them of the basest sort of people , who , because they want those things at home , and are not able to provide them from other places , are con - 166 1592 - strained to use straw for the dressing of their meat . But when the sharp rigor of snowy Winter comes on , these poor people betake them to their ox stalls , & there setting up sheds , & doing their necessary business in the day time , when they are not able to make fires , they borrow heat from their oxen , as it hath been reported to me by others : And so they only , being very few in number , do not willingly enjoy , but are constrained to use the same common house with their oxen . But for their livelihood and state it is far otherwise with them then with their oxen , of which thing I have entreated before . This is the lot , & poverty of certain men in those petty parishes , the condition whereof is therefore made a common byeword of the people among us , though somewhat injuriously . Where I would willingly demand with what honesty men can impute that unto the whole nation , which is hard and skantly true of these few poor men ? I am weary to stay any longer in this matter : only , because I have to do with Divines , let that of Salomon suffice , Proverbs 17 . verse 5 . He that mocks the poor , reproacheth him that made him . And in very deed , because this our nation is now , and heretofore hath been poor and needy , and as it were a beggar amongst many rich men , it hath sustained so many taunts and scoffs of strangers . But let them take heed whom they upbraid . Verily if there were nothing else common unto us with them , yet we both consist of the same elements , and have all one father and God . 167 [ The fourth The fourth
