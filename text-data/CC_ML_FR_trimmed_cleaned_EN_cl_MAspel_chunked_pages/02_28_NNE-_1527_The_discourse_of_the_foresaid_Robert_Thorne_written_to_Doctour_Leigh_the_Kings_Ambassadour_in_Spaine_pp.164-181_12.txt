conjectures , as the Navigants have esteemed the way they have gone . But it is manifest that Spaine had the situation of all the lands from Cape Verde , towards the Orient of the Portingals to their 180 degrees . And in all their Cards they never hitherto set the said Islands within their limitation of the said 180 degrees , ( though they knew very well of the Islands , ) till now that the Spaniards discovered them . And it is known that the king of Portingal had trade to these Islands afore , but would never suffer Portingal to go thither from Calicut : for so much as he knew that it fell out of his dominion : lest by going thither there 174 might come some knowledge of those other Islands of the king of Spaine , but bought the cloves of Merchants of that country , that brought them to Calicut , much dearer then they would have cost , if he had sent for them , thinking after this manner it would abide always secret . And now that it is discovered he sends and keeps the Spaniards from the trade all that he can . Also it should seem that when this foresaid consent of the division of the world was agreed of between them , the king of Portingal had already discovered certain Islands that lie over against Cape Verde , and also certain part of the main land of India towards the South , from whence he fette Brasill , and called it the land of Brasil . So for that all should come in his term and limits , he took three hundred and seventie leagues beyond Cape Verde : and after this , his 180 degrees , being his part of the world , should begin in the Card right over against the 340 degrees , where I have made a little compass with a cross , and should finish at the 160 degree , where also I have made another little mark . And after this computation without any controversy , the Islands of the spicery fall out of the Portingals domination . So
