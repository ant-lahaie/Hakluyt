provided boats and went up the river of Volga to Cazan , with such goods as they had recovered from the Cassaks . From Cazan they went towards Yeraslave , but in the way the ice intercepted them about the beginning of October , ' where suddenly in the night they were taken with a cruel and vehement frost , and therewithal ! the waters so congealed , that their boats were crushed and cut in sunder with the ice , whereby they sustained both a further danger of life and loss of goods : but as much as they could preserve with much ado , they conveyed over land in sleds to Vologda , and from thence sent much I56 of it to Saint Nicholas to be laden in the ships for England . But Master Ducket , Lionel Plumtree and Amos Riall went with some parcels to the Mosko , and there sold certain quantities of it to the Emperor , who pitying the mighty loss that they had sustained by his own rebellious people and subject ' s , bought himself as much as he liked , and paid present money for the same . So that Winter being spent out in Mosko , and such wares provided by them as served for England , they departed to Saint Nicholas , and there embarked in the month of August : and having endured a very terrible passage in nine weeks and three days , with some hardness of victuals , contrary and furious winds , and other sea accidents , they arrived at London in the month of October , one thousand five hundred seventie and foure , and so made and end of and unfortunate voyage : which if it had pleased God to prosper , that all things had come home as safely as they were carefully provided , and painfully laboured for , it had proved the richest voyage and most profitable return of commodity , that had ever be undertaken by English merchant ' s , who , notwithstanding all misfortunes , lost nothing of their principali adventure , but only the interest and gain that might have risen by the use of their stock in the mean time .
