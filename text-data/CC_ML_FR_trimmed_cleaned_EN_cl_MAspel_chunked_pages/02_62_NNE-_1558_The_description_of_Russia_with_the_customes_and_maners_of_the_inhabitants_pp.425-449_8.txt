after them the Metropolitan who is led between two priests , and after the Metropolitan came the Emperor with his crown upon his head , and after his majesty all his noble men orderly . Thus they followed the procession unto the water , & when they came unto the hold that was made , the priests set themselves in order round about it . And at one side of the same pool there was a scaffold of boards made , upon which stood a fair chair in which the Metro - 432 politan was set , but the Emperors majesty stood upon the ice . After this the priests began to sing , to bless and to sense , and did their service , and so by that time that they had done , the water was holy , which being sanctified , the Metropolitan took a little thereof in his hands , and cast it on the Emperor , likewise upon certain of the Dukes , 8c then they returned again to the church with the priests that sat about the water : but that press that there was about the water when the Emperor was gone , was wondered to behold , for there came above 5000 pots to be filled of that water : for that Moscovite which hath no part of that water , thinks himself unhappy . And very many went naked into the water , both men and women and children : after the press was a little gone , the Emperors Jennets and horses were brought to drink of the same water , and likewise many other men brought their horses thither to drink , and by that means they make their horses as holy as themselves . All these ceremonies being ended , we went to the Emperor to dinner , where we were served in vessels of silver , and in all other points as we had be beforetime . The Russes begin their Lent always 8 weeks before The Russes Easter : the first week they eat eggs , milk , cheese 8c Lent - butter , and make great cheer with pancakes and such other things , one friend visiting
