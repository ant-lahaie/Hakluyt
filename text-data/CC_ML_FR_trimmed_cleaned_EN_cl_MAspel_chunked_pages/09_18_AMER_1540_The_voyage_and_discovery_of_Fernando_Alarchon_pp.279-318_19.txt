should join their hands in the worshipping of the cross : others showed me whither they were well set in such & such sort , so that they would not let me be quiet . Near unto the other side of the river was greater store of people , which called unto me very often , that I would receive the victuals which they had brought me . And because I perceived that one envied the other , because I would not leave them discontented , I did so . And here came before me another old man like unto the former with the like ceremonies & Another old offerings : and I sought to learn something of him as man ' I had done of the other . This man said likewise to the rest of the people , This is our lord . Now you see how long ago our ancestors told us , that there were bearded & white people in the world , and we laughed them to scorn . I which am old and the rest which are here , have never seen any such people as these . And if you will not believe me , behold these people which be in this river : let us give them therefore meat , seeing they give us of their victuals : let us willingly serve this lord , which wishes us so well , and forbiddeth us to make war , and embraceth all of us : and they have mouth , hands and eyes as we have , and speak as we do . 1 gave these likewise another cross as I had done to the others beneath , and said unto them the self same words : which they listened unto with a better will , & used greater diligence to learn that which I said . Afterwards as I passed farther up the river , I found another people , whom mine interpreter understood not a whit : wherefore I showed them by signs the self - Their ancestors told them thattherewere bearded and white men In the world . Another nation .
