Paris at right Angles , but at Angles very uneven , and unlike as it doth the Horizon of the Equinoctial . Also the Summer day at Paris is sixteene hours long , and the night but eight : where contrariwise under the Equinoctial the day is but twelve hours long , and so long is also the night , in whatsoever Parallel the Sun be : and therefore look what odds and difference of proportion there is between . the Suns abided above the Horizon in Paris , and the abided it hath under the Equinoctial , ( it being in Cancer ) the same proportion would seem to be between the heat of the one place , and heat of the other : for other things ( as the Angle of the whole ark of the Suns progress that day in both places ) are equal . But under the Equinoctial the presence and abided of the Sun above the Horizon is equal to his absence , and abided under the Horizon , eke being twelve hours . And at Paris the continuance and abided of the Sun is above the Horizon sixteene hours long , and but eight hours absence , which proportion is double , from which if the proportion of the equality be subtracted to find the difference , there will remain still a double propor - 259 In what proportion the Angle of the Sun beantes heateth . They use and have need of fire under the Equinoctial . Cold intermingled with heat under the Equinoctial . cion , whereby it seems to follow , that in June the heat at Paris were double to the heat under the equinoctial . For ( as I have said ) the Angles of the Sun beams are in all points equal , and the cause of difference is , Mora Solis supra Horizontem , the stay of the Sun in the one Horizon more then in the other . Therefore , whosoever could find out in what proportion the Angle of the Sun beams heateth , and what increase the Suns continuance doth add thereunto , it might
