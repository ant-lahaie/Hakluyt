a swift course , above 500 whale ' s came athwart of us in 2 or 3 skulls within one hours space , which were so huge , as it was wonderful , and some of them came so near unto the ship , that they swam under the same from one side to another , whereupon we were in great fear , lest they should do us some hurt , but they could not because the ship had a prosperous and good wind , and made much way , whereby it could receive no harm , although they touched and struck the same . Among these Islands are such abundance of those weeds , that if at any time we were enforced to sail over them they hindered the course of our ships . They grow fourteene or fifteene fathom deep under the water , their tops reaching foure or five fathom above the water . They are of the colour of yellow wax , & their stalk grows great proportionably . This weed is much more beautiful then it is set forth , and no marvel , for the natural painter and creator thereof is most excellent . This relation was taken out of that which Francis Preciado brought with him . After this ship the Santa Agueda departed from the general Ulloa , and returned back the 5 of April , she arrived in the port of Sant Iago de buena esperan ^ a the 18 of the said month , and after she had stayed there foure or five days , she departed for Acapulco : howbeit until this present seventeenth of May in the year 1540 , I have herd no tidings nor news of her . Moreover after the departure of the Santa Agueda for Nueva Espanna , the General Francis Ulloa in the ship called the Trinitie proceeding on his discovery coasted the land until he came to a point called Cabo deal Enganno standing in thirty degrees and a half of Northerly latitude , and then returned back to Newspaine , because he found the winds very contrary , and his victuals failed him .
