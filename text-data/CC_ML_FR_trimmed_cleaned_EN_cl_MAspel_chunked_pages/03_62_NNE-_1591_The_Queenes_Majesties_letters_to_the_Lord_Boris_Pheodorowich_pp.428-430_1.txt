a most assured argument of your undoubted love and affection towards us ) that your Lordship hath vouchsafed , and of purpose taken into your hands the protection of our said Merchant ' s , and the hearing and determining of all their causes and occasions whatsoever , which shall concern them or their trade . All which we conceive to be done for our sake , and therefore do acknowledge our selves t ' o be , and still will continue beholding unto you for the same . And whereas we have made mention in our said letters written to our loving brother the Emperor of certain debts due aswell to our merchant ' s , as to other of our subject ' s by one William Turnebull a subject of ours late deceased in Russia , we pray you to be referred to the said letter . And forasmuch as the said cause will fallen under your Lordship ' s jurisdiction by reason of your acceptation of all their causes into your patronage and protection : we are so well assured of your honourable inclination to justice , and your good affection towards our merchant ' s for our sake , that we shall not need to entreat your honourable furtherance either of justice or expedition in the said cause . And lastly considering that your noble lineage together with your great wisdom and desert hath made you a principali Counselor and director of the state of so great a Monarchic , whereby your advice and direction is followed in all things that do concern the same , we have given order to our said principali Counselor William Lord Burghley , treasurer of our Realm of England , that as any occasion shall arise to the hindrance of the intercourse between 429 A .

And thus with our princely commendations we bid you farewell . From our royal Palace of Whitehall the foureteenth day of Januariee , Anno Domini 1591 .
