that of your love and friendship , having regard of us , and consideration of justice , you would command that our foresaid 348 merchants , who as yet remain alive , and who also at the time of the said felony committed , were shut up in close prison , be delivered out of the said thraldom , causing their goods which have be taken from them , to be , according unto justice , restored to them again . And that the delivery of our foresaid merchants and goods , may be the more easily yielded unto , may it please you with diligent observation to consider , that Gefferey Drew , and certain other of our merchants of Lenne , upon occasion of the grievances offered unto your merchants within our Realm , ( as the report goes ) at the suit of Tidman Lip , paid unto the same your merchants and hundreth pound sterling : even as in a certain Indenture made between Ingelram Lend of Thorenden , and some other of your merchants on the one part , and between the foresaid Geffrey , and certain of our merchants on the other part , we saw contained . Moreover , if any of your subject ' s be minded to exhibit , and effectually to prosecute their complaints in our Court , concerning any of our subject ' s , or of any injury done unto them , we will cause the petitions of those your subject ' s to be admitted , and also full and speedy justice to be administered , upon any such like complaints of theirs . Insomuch , that those your subject ' s shall think themselves right well and sufficiently contented therewithal ! . And in the mean space we will cause diligent inquisition of the truth to be made , of all excesses and grievances howsoever offered unto your subject ' s within our dominions . May it please you therefore , by the bearer of these presents , to return and answer unto us , what you are determined to do in the premises . Given at Westminster , the third day of April .
