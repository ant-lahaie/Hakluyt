sayeth : It is reported that in Cardia near to the place of Daschylus , in the white field , there is water sweeter then milk . Another also near unto the bridge which we pass over going to the town of Valdeburg . Propertius likewise in the third book of his Elegies mentioneth certain waters representing the savour of wine in these words . Amid the Isle of Naxus lo , with fragrant smells and fine A freshet runs ; the Naxians go fill cups , carouse , there â€™ s wine . 133 This Naxus is one of the Hands called Cyclades lying in the TEgaean sea . Cardane gives a reason hereof , namely , because Hydromel or water - honey , in long continuance will become wine . Aristotle names a fountain in Sicilia , which the inhabitants use in stead of vinegar . The same author makes the cause of savours in water to be heat , because the earth being hight changes and gives savour unto the water . Now concerning the colours of water so sayeth Cardane . There is the same reason ( says he ) of the colours of water , that there is of the savours thereof , for both have their originali from the earth . For there is white water within two miles of Glauca a town in Misena : read water in Radera a river of Misena not far from Radeburg . : & in old time near unto Joppa in Judea : green water in the mountain of Carpathus by Neusola : sky - coloured or blue water between the mountains of Feltrius & Tarvisius : & it is reported that there was water of that colour in Thermopylis : coalblack water in Alera a river of Saxonie , at that place where it dischargeth it self into the Weser . The causes of these colours are the colours of the soil . Also Aristotle sayeth , that about the promontory of Japigia , there is a fountain which streameth blood : adding moreover , that Mariners are driven far from that place of the sea ,
