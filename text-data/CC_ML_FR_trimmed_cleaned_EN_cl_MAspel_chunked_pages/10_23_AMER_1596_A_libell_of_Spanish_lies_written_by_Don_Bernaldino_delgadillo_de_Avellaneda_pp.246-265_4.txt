water , and to repair our ships ) we stayed in that port : whereas I had intelligence by and Indian that Francis Drake died in Number de Dios , for very grief that he had lost so many Barks and men , as was afterwards more manifestly known . Thus having given you a relation of all that happened hitherto , now I let you understand , that I left this Port the second of March , and took our course towards Havana , where I thought to have found the English fleet . And having used all the diligence possible , upon Munday the eleventh of the said month , about two of the clock in the afternoon , at the end of thee He of Pinos , in the entrance of Guaniguanico , I met with the English fleet , being fourteene very good ships : I drew towards them although they had the wind of us , and our 250 Admiral who boar up towards the wind , with other two ships began to draw near them , and although we set thus upon them , three times with all their ships , yet would they not set again upon us , and those of our men which were farthest off cried to them amain , being both within shot of artillery , muskets , and calivers , whereby they received evident hurt by us : They plied their great ordinance according to their manner , and especially their Viceadmiral , and seeing our resolution how sharp we were bent towards them , they with all expedition and speed possible prepared to fly away , hoisting sails and leaving their boats for haste in the sea : but I followed them , with nine ships all the night following , and with foure more the next day , till I made them double the Cape of S . Antonie , and to take the course towards the Channel of Bahama , according to the instructions from his Majesty . It little availed us to be seen , with less number of ships , neither yet all the diligence we could use , could cause them to stay or come near us
