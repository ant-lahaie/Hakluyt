one thing I will add : in these Hands , the summer to be most hight , the winter extreme cold . In the kingdom of Canga , as we call it , falls so much snow , that the houses being buried in it , the inhabitants keep within doors certain months of the year , having no way to come forth except they break up the tiles . Whirlwinds most vehement , earthquakes so common , that the Japans dread such kind of fears little or nothing at all . The country is full of silver mines otherwise barren , not so much by fault of nature , as through the slothfulness of the inhabitants : howbeit Oxen they keep and that for tillage sake only . The air is wholesome , the waters good , the people very fair and well bodied : bore headed commonly they go , procuring baldness with sorrow and tears , eftsoons rooting up with pinsars all the hair of their heads as it grows , except it be a little behind , the which they knot and keep with all diligence . Even from their childhood they wear daggers and swords , the which they use to lay under their pillows when they go to bed : in show courteous and affable , in deed haughty and proud . They delight most in warlike affairs , and their greatest study is arms . Mens apparel diversely coloured is worn down half the legs and to the elbows : women ' s attire made handsomely like unto a veil , is somewhat longer : all manner of dicing and theft they do eschew . The merchant , although he be wealthy , is not accounted of . Gentlemen , be they never so poor , retain their place : most precisely they stand upon their honour and worthiness , ceremoniously striving among themselves in courtesies and fair speeches . Wherein if any one happily be less careful than he should be , even 333 for a trifle many times he gets evil will . Want , though it trouble most of them , so much they do detest
