, if it were thought needful ! : who at their coming to Benin , found the Captain and your son William Bird dead , and Thomas Hempsteede very weak , who also died within two days after their coming thither . This sorrowful accident caused them with such pepper and teeth , as they could then find , speedily to return to the ship , as by the Cargason will appear : at their coming away the Veadore told them , that if they could or would stay any longer time , he would use all possible expedition to bring in more commodities : but the common sickness so increased and continued among us all , that by the time our men which remained were come aboard , we had so many sick and dead of our company , that we looked all for the same happen , and so thought to lose both our ship , life , country and all . Very hardly and with much ado could we get up our anchors , but yet at the last by the mercy of God having got them up , but leaving our pinnace behind us , we god to sea , and set sail , which was upon the 13 of Aprill . After which by little and little our men began to gather up their crumbs and to recover some better strength : and so sailing betwixt the Islands of Cape Verde , and the main we came to the Islands of the Azores upon the 25 of July , where our men began a fresh to grow ill , and diverse died , among whom Samuel Dun was one , and as many as remained living were in a hard case : but in the midst of our distress , it fell so well out , by Gods good providence , that we met with your ship the Bark Burre , on this side the North cape , 460 1590 . which did not only keep us good company , but also sent us sixe fresh men aboard , without whose help , we should surely have tasted of many inconveniences . But by this good means we are now at the last arrived in Plimouth , this 9 day of September : and for want of better health at this time , I refer the further knowledge of more particularities , till my coming to London . Yours to command Anthony Ingram .
