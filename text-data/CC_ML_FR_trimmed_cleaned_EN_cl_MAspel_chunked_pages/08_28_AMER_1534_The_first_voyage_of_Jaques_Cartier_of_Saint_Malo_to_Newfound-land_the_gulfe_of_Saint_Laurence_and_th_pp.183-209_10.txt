Hands , two of which are as steep and upright as any wall , so that it was not possible to climb them : and between them there is a little rock . These Hands were as full of birds , as any field or meadow is of grass , which there do make their nests : and in the greatest of them , there was a great and infinite number of those that we call Margaulx , that are white , and bigger then any geese , which were severed in one part . In the other were only Godetz , but towards the shore there were of those Godetz , and great Apponatz , like to those of that Hand that we above have mentioned : we went down to the lowest part of the least Hand , where we killed above a thousand of those Godetz , and Apponatz . We put into our boats so many of them as we pleased , for in less then one hour we might have filled thirtie such boats of The Islands them : we nam them The Hands of Margaulx . About of Margaulx . gve ] eagUes from the said Hands on the West , there is another Hand that is about two leagues in length , and so much in breadth : there did we stay all night to take in water and wood . That Island is environed round about with sand , and hath a very good road about it three or foure fathom deep . Those Hands have the best soil that ever we saw , for that one of their fields is more worth then all the New land . We found it all full of goodly trees , meadows , fields full of wild corn and peason bloomed , as thick , as rank , and as fair as any can be seen in Britaine , so that they seemed to have be plowed and sowed . There was also a great store of gooseberries , strawberries , damask roses , parsley , Morses or Sea other very sweet and pleasant herbs .
