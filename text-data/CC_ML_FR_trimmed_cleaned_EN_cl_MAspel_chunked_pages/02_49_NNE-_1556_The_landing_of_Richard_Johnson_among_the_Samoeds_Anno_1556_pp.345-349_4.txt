of the line stiff and together , and then I heard a thing fallen into the kettle of water which was before him in the tent . Thereupon I asked them that sat by me what it was that fell into the 348 water that stood before him . And they answered me , that it was his head , his shoulder and left arm , which the line had cut off , I mean the knot which I saw [ I . 285 . J afterward drawn hard together . Then I rose up and would have looked whither it were so or not , but they laid hold on me , and said , that if they should see him with their bodily eyes , they should live no longer . And the most part of them can speak the Russe tongue to be understood : and they took me to be a Russian . Then they began to hallow with these words , Oghaoo , Oghaoo , Oghaoo , many times together . And as they were thus singing & out calling , I saw a thing like a finger of a man two times together thrust through the gown from the Priest . I asked them that sat next to me what it was that I saw , and they said , not his finger ; for he was yet dead : and that which I saw appear through the gown was a beast , but what beast they knew not nor would not tell . And I looked upon the gown , and there was no hold to be seen : and then at the last the Priest lifted up his head with his shoulder and arm , and all his body , and came forth to the fire . Thus far of their service which I saw during the space of certain hours : but how they do worship their Idols that I saw not : for they put up their stuff for to remove from that place where they lay . And I went to him that served the Priest , and asked him what their God said to him when he lay as dead . He answered , that his own people doth not know : neither is it for them to know : for they must do as he commanded . This I saw the lift day of Januarie in the year of our Lord 1556 . after the English account .
