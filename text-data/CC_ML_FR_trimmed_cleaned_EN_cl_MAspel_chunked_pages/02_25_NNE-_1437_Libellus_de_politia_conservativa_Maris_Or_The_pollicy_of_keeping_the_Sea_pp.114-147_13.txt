to oste In their countries , & in this English cost They should not so ? but have more liberty Then we our selves now also motte I thee . I would to gifts men should take no heed That lets our thing public for to speed . For this we see well every day at eye , Gifts and fests stopen our policy . Now see that fools ben either they or we : But ever we have the worse in this country . Therefore let hem unto oste go here , Or be we free with hem in like manner In their countries : and if it will not be , Compel them unto oste , and ye shall see Much advantage , and much proiite arise , Much more then I can write in any wise . Of our charge and discharge at her marts .. COnceive well here , that Englishmen at marts Be discharged , for all her crafts and arts , In Brabant of her marchandy In fourteene days , and again hastily In the same days fourteene acharged eft . And if they bide longer all is bereft , Anon they should forfeit her goods all , Or marchandy : it should no better fallen . And we to martis in Brabant charged been With English cloth full good and fair to seen : We ben again charged with mercery , Haburdasher ware , and with grosserie : To which marts , that English men call fairs , Each nation oft makes her repairs : 128 C . 1437 . English , and French , Lombards , Jennoyes , Catalones , thedre they take her ways : Scots , Spaniards , Irishmen there abides , With great plenty bringing of sale hides . And I here say that we in Brabant buy , Flanders and Zeland more of marchandy In common use then done all other nations : This have I herd of merchants relations : And if the English been not in the marts They been feeble , and as nought be her parts . For they byemore , and from purse put out More marchandie then all the other rout
