quintals of gold by the year ; the goodness whereof you know . What rend Gago will yield , you shall know at the Spring , for then Alcaide Hamode comes home . The rend of Tombuto is come by the cafelow or carovan , which is , as above is mentioned , 60 quintals . The report is , that Mahomed brings with him such and infinite treasure as I never herd of : it does appear that they have more gold then any other part of the world beside . The Alcaide wins all the country where he goes without fighting , and is going down towards the sea coast . This king of Marocco is like to be the greatest prince in the world for money , if he keep this country . But I make account assoon as the king of Spaine hath quietness in Christendome , he will thrust him out : for that the kings force is not great as yet ; but he means to be stronger . There is a camp ready to go now with a viceroy : the speech is with 3000 men : but I think they will be hardly 2000 ; for by report , 3000 men are enough to conquer all the country : for they have no defence of importance against and enemy . I think Hamode will be returned home in January or thereabouts : for he stays but for the coming of the viceroy . Mulley Balasen the kings son of Marocco was slain in Guinea by his own men , and they were presently killed , because they should tell no tales . And thus leaving to trouble you , I commit you IOI to God , who prosper you in all your proceedings . From Marocco the first of August 1594 . Yours to command for ever Laurence Madoc . Of these two rich cities and kingdoms of Tombuto and Gago Leo Africanus writeth at large in the beginning of his seventh book of the description of Africa , which worthy work is to be annexed into the end of this second volume .
