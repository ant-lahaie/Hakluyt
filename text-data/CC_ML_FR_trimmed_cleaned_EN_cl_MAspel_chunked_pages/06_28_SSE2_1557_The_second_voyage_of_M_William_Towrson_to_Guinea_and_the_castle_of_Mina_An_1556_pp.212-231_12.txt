saw us in the weather of them , or else without doubt they had taken or sunk them , for three of them which were the smallest , went so fast that it was not possible for a ship to board them , and carried such ordinance that if they had had the weather of us , they would have troubled 3 of the best ships that we had , and as for their Admiral and Viceadmiral they were both notably appointed . When the Frenchman was clear of them , he lay as near the wind as he could , and we followed them still towards the shore , and then the Admiral ran to Sea after the rest , and left us all alone : and when the Portugals perceived that we were alone , and gave them chase , they kept about with us and we with them , to keep the wind of them , and we ran still within base 222 shot of them , but they shot not at us , because we had the weather of them , and saw that they could do us no hurt : and thus we followed one another until night , and in the night we lost them , but as for all the rest of our ships , they packed on all the sails that they could and ran to sea , and as they themselves confess , they prayed for us , but as for help at their hands we could have none . The 28 day we met with our Viceadmiral , our pinnace , and two of the Frenchmen , and the third was fled which was a ship of fourscore tun , and belonged to Roan : and when I had the sighed of the rest of our ships , I took our skiff and went to them to know why they lost us in such a case , and John Kire made me answer that his ship would neither rear nor steer , and as for the pinnace , John Davis made me answer that she would do nothing , and that he could carry her no further , for her rudder was broken
