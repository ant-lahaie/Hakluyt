And ancient testimony translated out of the old Saxon laws , containing among other things the advancement of Merchants for their thrice crossing the wide seas , set down by the learned Gentleman Master William Lambert pagina 500 . of his perambulation of Kent . IT was sometime in English laws , that the people and the laws were in reputation : and then were the wisest of the people worshipworthy , every one after his degree : Earl , and Churl , Thein , and under - Thein . And if a churl thrived so , that he had fully five hides of his own land , a Church and a Kitchen , a Belhouse , and a gate , a seat , and a several office in the Kings hall , then was he thenceforth the Theins right worthy . And if a Thein so thrived , that he served the king , and on his message rid in his household , if he then had a Thein that followed him , the which to the kings journey five hides had , and in the kings seat his Lord served , and thrice with his errand had gone to the king , he might afterwards with his foreoth his lords part play at any great need . And if a Thein did thrive so , that he became and Earl ; then was he afterwards and Earls right worthy . And if a Merchant so thrived , that he passed thrice over the wide seas , of his own craft , he was thenceforth a Theins right worthy . And if a scholar so prospered thorough learning that he degree had , and served Christ , he was then afterwards of dignity and peace so much worthy , as thereunto belonged : unless he forfeited so , that he the use of his degree use ne might .
