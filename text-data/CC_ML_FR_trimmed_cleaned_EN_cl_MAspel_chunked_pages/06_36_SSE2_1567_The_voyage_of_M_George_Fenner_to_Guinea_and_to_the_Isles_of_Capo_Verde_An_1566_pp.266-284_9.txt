was last of all hurt , lay lame not able to help himself : only two recovered of their hurts . So we placed other men in the rooms of those that we lost , and set sail . The 26 day between Cape Verde and Bona vista we saw many flying fish of the bigness of herrings , whereof two flew into our boat , which we towed at our stern . The 28 day we fell with and Hand called Bona vista , which is from Cape Verde 86 leagues . The Northside of the said Hand is full of white sandy hills and dales , and somewhat high land . The said day we came to and anchor within the Westermost point , about a league within the point , and found in our sounding fair sand in ten fathom water , but you may go near till you be in five or six fathom , for the ground is fair . As soon as we were at and anchor , our general sent his pinnace a land , and found five or sixe small houses , but the people were fled into the mountains : and the next day he sent a shore again , and met with two Portugals , who willingly went aboard with his men , and at their coming he welcomed them , although they were but poor & simple , and gave each of them a pair of shoes , and so set them a shore again . The 30 day we weighed & sailed into a Bay within a small Hand about a league from us , and took plenty of diverse sorts of fish . The foresaid Hand lies in sixteene degrees . And if you mean to anchor in the said Bay , you may borrow in foure or five fathom of the Southermost point of the said Hand , which you may see 274 ... I567 ' when you ride in the road . But beware of the middle of the Bay , for there lies a ledge of rocks , which at a admonttl , > n - lowe water breaks , yet there is three fathom water over them .
