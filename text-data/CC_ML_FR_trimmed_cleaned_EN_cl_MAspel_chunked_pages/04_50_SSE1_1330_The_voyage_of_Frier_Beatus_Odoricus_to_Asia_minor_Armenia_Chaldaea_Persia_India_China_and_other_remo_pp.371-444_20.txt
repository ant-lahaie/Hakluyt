bound unto the said poles as they were before . And when I did eat of those fish , me thought they were exceeding good . Travailing thence many days journeys , at length I arrived at another city called * Canasia , which Cansahor signifies in our language , the city of heaven . Never in Quinzat - all my life did I see so great a city ; for it containeth in circuit and hundreth miles : neither saw I any plot thereof , which was not thoroughly inhabited : yea , I saw many houses of tenne or twelve stories high , one above another . It hath mighty large suburbs containing more people then the city it self . Also it hath twelve principali gates : and about the distance of eight miles , in the high way unto every one of the said gates stands a city as big by estimation as Venice , and Padua . The foresaid city of Canasia is situated in waters or marshes , which always stand still neither ebb - ing nor flowing : howbeit it hath a defence for the wind The Italian like unto Venice . In this city there are more then 10002 . bridges , many whereof I numbered and passed over them : 7ioo ^ and upon every of those bridges stand certain watch - bridges . 425 men of the city , keeping continual watch and ward about the said city , for the great Can the Emperor of Catay . The people of this country say , that they have one duty enjoined unto them by their lord : for every fire payeth one Balis in regard of tribute : and a Balis is five papers or pieces of silk , which are worth one floren and and half of our coin . Tenne or twelve households are accounted for one fire , and so pay tribute but for one fire only . All those tributary fires amount unto the number of 85 . Thuman , with other foure Thuman of the Saracens , which make 89 . in all ; And one Thuman con - sisteth 10000 . fires
