in mire and water up to you neck , restrained from all conference and company of men , and also that their meat was thrown unto them , as a bone to a dog , with many other enormities , which they have most slanderously devised concerning the master general aforesaid , and his people , and have published them in these dominions : upon the occasion of which falsehoods certain merchants of our parts , and of other regions of Alemain ( who , of your special benevolence , were endued with certain privileges and favours in your city of London , and in other places ) were , as malefactors , apprehended and carried to prison , until such time as the truth was more apparent . Whereupon , the foresaid master general propoundeth his humble suit unto your majesty , that such enemies of truth and concord , your Majesty would vouchsafe in such sort to chastise , that they may be and example unto others presuming to do the like . Moreover , ( high and mighty Prince and lord ) it was reported unto our Master general , that his former Legates required of your majesty safe conduct freely to come into your highness Realm . Which when he herd , he was exceedingly offended thereat , since undoubtedly they did not this at his commandment or direction . We therefore humbly beseech your Grace , as touching this oversight , to hold the Master general excused , because there is no need of safe conduct , between so speciali friends . ii 17 B Furthermore , sundry damages and complaints of the foresaid general Master , and his subject ' s are briefly exhibited , and put down in the bills following . Also , all and singular damnified persons , beside other proofs , were compelled to verify their losses by their formali oaths , taken upon the holy Bible . Lastly , we do make our humble suit and petition unto the providence and discretion of your Highness , and of your honourable Council , that concerning the premises , and all other matters propounded , or to be propounded unto your Majesty , we may obtain a speedy answer , and and effectual end . For it would redound unto our great charges and loss to make any long delays .
