all this day we lay still being enclosed with ice , that we could not stir , labouring only to defend the ice as it came upon us . Here we had 68 . fathoms oz . The 8 . day was very fair & calm but foggy . This day towards night there was little wind by the South Southwest : then the ice began a little to open , and here we had 70 . fathoms oz : all the night was foggy . The 9 . day the wind was at Northwest , and by West , all the afternoon we lay still because of the ice , which did still enclose us . This day we found 70 . degr . 4 . the pole elevated seventy degrees , 4 . minutes , we had mtn - 63 . fathoms oz : this night was a very fair night , Frost . but it freezed : in the morning we had much ado to go through the same : and we were in doubt that if it should have freezed so much the night following , The appearing we should hardly have passed out of it . This night j was one star that appeared to us . The tenth day the wind was at East Northeast with a very small gale . we with sail and oars made way through the ice : about five in the morning we set sail : sometime we say Southwest , and sometime South , and sometime West , as we might best find the way . About three in the afternoon the gale began to fresh : about sixe in the afternoon the wind was at Northeast with fog . Here we had eighty eight Much snow , fathoms : we bore sail all the same night , and it snowed very much . 294 The eleventh day we were much troubled with ice , and by great force we made our way through it , which we thought a thing impossible : but extremity does cause men to do much , and in the weakness of man Gods strength most appears .
