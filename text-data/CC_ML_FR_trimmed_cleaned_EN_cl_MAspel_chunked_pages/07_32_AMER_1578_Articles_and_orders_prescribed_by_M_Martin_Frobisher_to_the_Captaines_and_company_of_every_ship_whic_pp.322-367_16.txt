Although nature and natural courses be forced and resisted never so much , yet at last they will have their own sway again . Moreover it is not possible that so great course of floods and current , so high swelling tides with continuance of so deep waters , can be digested here without unburdening themselves into some open Sea beyond this place , which argue the more likelihood of the passage to be hereabout .
