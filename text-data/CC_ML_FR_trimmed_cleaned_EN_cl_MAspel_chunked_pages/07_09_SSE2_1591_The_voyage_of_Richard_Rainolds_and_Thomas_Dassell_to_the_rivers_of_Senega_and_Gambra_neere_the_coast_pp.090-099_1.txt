Frenchmen of Diepe and New - haven have traded trade thither above thirty years : and commonly with foure or five ships a year , whereof two small barks go into the ' river of Senega . The other were wont ( until within these foure years , that our ships came thither ) to ride with their ships in the road of Porto d ’ Ally and so sent their small shaloups of sixe or eight tons to some of these places on the Sea coast before repeated . Where in all places generally they were well beloved and as courteously entertained of the Negroes , as if they had be naturally born in the country . And very often the Negroes come into France and return again , which is a further increasing of mutual love and amity . Since our coming to that coast the Frenchmen ride with their ships at Refisca Viejo , and suffer us to anchor with our ships at Porto d ’ Ally . The Frenchmen never use to go into the river of Gambra : which is a river of secret Gambra d trade and riches concealed by the Portugals . For long since one Frenchman entered the river with a small bark conceaied . which was betrayed , surprised , and taken by two galleys of the Portugals . In our second voyage and second year there were by vile treacherous means of the Portugals and the king v ° 3a &- of the Negroes consent in Porto d ’ Ally and Joala about forty Englishmen cruelly slain and captived , and most Forty English or all of their goods confiscated : whereof there returned mentraMr - onely two , which were the merchants . And also by pro - and captived . curement of Pedro Gonsalves , one of DONE Antonio the kings servants , Thomas Dassel and others had be betrayed , if it had not pleased almighty God to reveal the same , whereby it was prevented . From the South side of Senega river on the Sea coast unto about Palmerin is all one kingdom of Negros . The kings name is Melick Zamba , who dwells two days
