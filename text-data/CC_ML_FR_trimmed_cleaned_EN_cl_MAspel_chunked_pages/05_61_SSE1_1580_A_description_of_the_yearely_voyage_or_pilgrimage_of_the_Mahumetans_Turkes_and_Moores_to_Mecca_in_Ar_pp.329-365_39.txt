, not seeing any way whereby to flee , drew out his sword , and striking the said mountain , divided it in sunder , and passing thorough saved his life on the other side . Moreover , this Alli among the Persians is had in greater reverence then Mahumet , who affirm , that the said Alli hath done greater things and more miraculous then Mahumet , and therefore they esteem him for God almighty his fellow . But to return to our matter , the captain with the carovan within two days after returns for Cairo , and coming to Ezlem , finds there a captain with threescore horses 364 come thither to bring refreshments to the said captain of the pilgrimage , as also to fell unto the pilgrim ' s some victuals . From thence they set forward , and commi ng to Birca within two leagues of Cairo , there is the master of the house of the Bassha of Cairo with all his horsemen come thither to receive him , with a sumptuous and costly banquet made at the cost of the Basham for the captain and his retinue , who after he is well refreshed departeth towards the castle of Cairo to salute the Basham , who receiving him with great joy and gladness in token of good will presents him with a garment of cloth of gold very rich : and the captain taking the Alcaron out of the chest presents it to the Basham , who having kissed it , commands to lay it up again . Some there are which affirm , that being arrived at Cairo , they kill that goodly camel which carried the Alcaron , and eat him ; which is nothing so : for they are so superstitious to the contrary , that to gain all the world they would not kill him .

And thus much concerning the voyage of the captain of the carovan of Cairo .
