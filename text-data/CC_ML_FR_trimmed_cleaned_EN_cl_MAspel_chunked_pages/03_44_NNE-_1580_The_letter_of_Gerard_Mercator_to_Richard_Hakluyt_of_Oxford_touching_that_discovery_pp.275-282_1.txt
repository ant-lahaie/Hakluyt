the coast of Cathaio may be discovered . And that there is such a huge promontory called Tabin , I am certainly persuaded not only out of Plinie , but also other writers , and some Maps ( though somewhat rudely drawn : ) and that the pole of the Loadstone is not far beyond Tabin , I have learned by the certain observations of the Loadstone : about which pole and Tabin I think there are very many rocks , and very hard and dangerous sailing : and yet a more hard and difficile passage I think it to be this way which is now attempted by the West , for it is nearer to the pole of the Loadstone , to the which I think it not safe to approach . And because the Loadstone hath another pole then that of the world , to the which from all parts it hath a respect , the nearer you come unto it , the more the needle of the Compass doth vary from the North , sometime to the West , and sometime to the East , according as a man is to the Eastward or to the 279 Westward of that Meridian , that passes by both the poles of the Magnes and the World .
