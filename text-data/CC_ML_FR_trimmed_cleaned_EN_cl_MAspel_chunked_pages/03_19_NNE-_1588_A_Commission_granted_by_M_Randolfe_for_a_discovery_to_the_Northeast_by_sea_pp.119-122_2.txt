Vaigats , whereas you may from that see the said Island Vaigats , if the time of the year will permit you , you shall from thence pass alongst by the said border and coast of Nova Zembla to the Westwards , and so to search whither that part of Nova Zembla do join with the land that sir Hugh Willoughby discovered in anno 53 , and is in 72 degrees , and from that part of Nova Zembla 120 leagues to the Westwards , as your plate doth show it unto you : and if you do find that land to join with Nova Zembla , when you come to it , you shall proceed further along the same coast , if the time of the year will permit it , and that you do think there will be sufficient time for you to return back with your bark to Winter either at Pechora or in Russia , at your discretion : for we refer the same to your good judgements , trusting that you will loose no time , that may further your knowledge in this voyage . Note you , it was the 20 of August , 56 year the Serchthrift began to return back from her discovery , to Winter in Russia , and then she came from the Island 121 Vaigats , being forcibly driven from thence with and Easterly wind and ice , and so she came into the river Dwina , and arrived at Colmogro the 11 of September , 56 . If the ice had not be so much that year as it was in the Straights , on both sides of the Island Vaigats , they in the said pinnace would that year have discovered the parts that you are now sent to seek : which thing ( if it had pleased God ) might have be done then : but God hath reserved it for some other . Which discovery , if it may be made by you , it shall not only prove profitable unto you , but it will also purchase perpetuali fame and renown both to you and our country . And thus not doubting of your willing desires , and forwardness towards the same , we pray God to bless you with a lucky beginning , fortunate success , and happily to end the same . Amen .
