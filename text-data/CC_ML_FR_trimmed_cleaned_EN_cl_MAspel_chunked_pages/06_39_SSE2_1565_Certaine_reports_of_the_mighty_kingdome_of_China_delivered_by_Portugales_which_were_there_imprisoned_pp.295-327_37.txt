market places wherein all things are to be sold through every street continually are cried all things [ II ii . 80 . ] necessary , as flesh of all sorts , freshfish , herbs , oil , vinegar , meal , rise : in summa , all things so plentifully , that many houses need no servants , every thing being brought to their doors . Most part of the merchants remain in the suburbs , for that the cities are shut up every night , as I have said . The merchants therefore , the better to attend their business , do choose rather to make their abided without in the suburbs then within 326 the city . I have seen in this river a pretty kind of fishing , not to be omitted in my opinion , and therefore I will set it down . The king hath in many rivers Odmcus good store of barges full of sea - crowes that breed , are the fed and do die therein , in certain cages , allowed ' monthly a certain provision of rise . These barges the king bestoweth upon his greatest magistrates , giving to some two , to some three of them as he thinketh good , to fish therewithal ! after this manner . At the hour appointed to fish , all the barges are brought together in a circle , where the river is shallow , and the crows tied together under the wings are let leap down into the water , some under , some above , worth the looking upon : each one as he hath filled his bag , goes to his own barge and emptieth it , which done , he returns to fish again . Thus having taken good store of fish , they set the crows at liberty , and do suffer them to fish for their own pleasure . There were in that city where I was , twentie barges at the least of these aforesaid crows . I went almost every day to see them , yet could I never be thoroughly satisfied to see so strange a kind of fishing .
