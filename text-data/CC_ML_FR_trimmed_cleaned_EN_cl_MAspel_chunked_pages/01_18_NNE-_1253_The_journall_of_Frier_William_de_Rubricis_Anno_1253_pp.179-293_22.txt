whosoever is present at the house 247 where any one grown to men estate lies dead , he must not enter into the court of Mangu - Can till one whole year be expired . If it were a child deceased he must not enter into the said court till the next month after . Near unto the grave of the party deceased they always leave one cottage . If any of their nobles ( being of the stock of Chingis , who was their first lord & father ) deceaseth , his sepulcher is unknown . And always about those places where they inter their nobles , there is one house of men to keep the sepulchers . I could not learn that they use to hide treasures in the graves of their dead . The Comanians built a great tomb over their dead , & erect the image of the dead party thereupon , with his face towards the East , holding a drinking cup in his hand , before his navel . They erect also upon the monuments of rich men , Pyramids , that is to say , little sharp houses or pinnacles : & in some places I saw mighty towers made of brick , in other places Pyramides made of stones , albeit there are no stones to be found thereabouts . I saw one newly buried , in whose behalf they hanged up 16 . horse hides , unto each quarter of the world 4 , between certain high posts : & they set beside his grave Cosmos for him to drink , & flesh to eat : & yet they said that he was baptised . I beheld other kinds of sepulchers also towards the East : namely large flowers or pavements made of stone , some round & some square , & then 4 . long stones pitched upright , about the said pavement towards the 4 . regions of the world . When any man is sick , he lies in his bed , & causeth a sign to be set upon his house , to signify that there lies a sick person there
