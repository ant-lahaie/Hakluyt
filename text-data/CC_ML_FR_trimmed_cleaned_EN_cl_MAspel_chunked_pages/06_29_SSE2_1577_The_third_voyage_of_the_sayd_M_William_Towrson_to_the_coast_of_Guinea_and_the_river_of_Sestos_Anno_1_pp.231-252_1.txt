them straightly , and first the Purser of the Unicorn , which was the smaller ship , confessed that they had two and thirty tons and a hogshead of a French men . Then we examined the Master in like case , and he acknowledged the same to be true . Then we examined also the Master of the great ship , and he confessed that he had and hundred and eight and twenty tons of the same French men , and more they would not confess , but said that all the rest was laden by Peter Lewgues of Hamburg , to be delivered to one Henry Summer of Camphire , notwithstanding all their letters were directed to Hamburg , and written in Dutch without , and within in French . When they had confessed that they had thus much French men ' s goods within their ships , we conferred together what was best to be done with them . William Cretton and Edward Selman were of the opinion , that it should be good either to carry them into Spaine , and there to make sale of the goods , or else into Ireland , or to return back again into England with them , if the wind would permit it . But I , weighing what charge we had of our Master ' s , first by mouth , and afterwards by writing , that for no such matter we should in any case prolong the time , for fear of losing the voyage , and considering that the time of the year was very far spent , and the money that we should make of the wines not very much , in respect of the commodity which we hoped for by the voyage , persuaded them that to go into Ireland , the wind being Easterly as it was , might be and occasion that we should be locked in there with that wind , and so loose our voyage : and to carry them into Spaine , seeing they sailed so ill , that having all their sails abroad , we kept them company only with our foresailes , 232 and without any top sails abroad
