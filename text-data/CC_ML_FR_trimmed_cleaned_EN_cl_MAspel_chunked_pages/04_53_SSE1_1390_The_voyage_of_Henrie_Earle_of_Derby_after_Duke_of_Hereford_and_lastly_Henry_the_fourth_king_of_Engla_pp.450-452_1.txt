a few months after their departure they returned home . The Historic is somewhat otherwise recorded by Froysard and Holenshed in manner following , Pag - 473 - IN the thirteenth year of the reign of king Richard the second , the Christians took in hand a journey against the Saracens of Barbarie through suit of the Genouois , so that there went a great number of Lords , Knights , and Gentlemen of France and England , the Duke of Burbon being their general . Out of England there went John the Beaufort bastard son to the Duke of Lancaster ( as Froysard hath noted ) also Sir John Russell , Sir John Butler , Sir John Harecourt and others . They set forward in the latter end of the thirteenth year of the Kings reign , and came to Genoa , where they remained not very long , but that the galleys and [ II i . 70 . ] other vessels of the Genouois were ready to pass them over into Barbarie . And so about midsummer in the beginning of the foureteenth year of this kings reign the whole army being embarked , sailed forth to the coast of Barbary , where near to the city of Africa they landed : at which instant the English archers ( as the Chronicles of Chro - Genoa write ) stood all the company in good stead with their long bows , beating back the enemies from the â€™ shore , which came down to resist their landing . After iv 451 2F2 they had god to land , they environed the city of Africa ( called by the Moors Mahdia ) with a strong siege : but at length , constrained with the intemperancy of the scalding air in that hight country , breeding in the army sundry diseases , they fell to a composition upon certain articles to be performed in the behalf of the Saracens : and so 61 days after their arrival there they took the seas again , and returned home , as in the histories of France and Genoa is likewise expressed . Where , by Polydore Virgil it may seem , that the lord Henry of Lancaster earl of Derby should be general of the English men , that ( as before you herd ) went into Barbary with the French men and Genouois .
