may any man buy any salt at one town to carry to another , but every one must buy his salt in the town where he dwells . Neither may any man in Venice buy more salt then he spendeth in the city , for if he be known to carry but one ounce out of the city and be accused , he loses and ear . The most part of all the salt they have in Venice comes from these Salines , and they have it so plentiful , that they are not able , never a year to gather the one half , for they only gather in July , August , and September , and not fully these three months . Yet notwithstanding the abundance that the ships carry away yearly , there remain heaps like hills , some heaps able to lade nine or tenne ships , and there are heaps of two years gathering , some of three and some of nine or tenne years making , to the valve of a great sum of gold , and when the ships do lade , they never take it by measure , but when they come at Venice they measure it . This salt as it lies in the pit is like so much ice , and it is sixe inches thick : they dig it with axes , and cause their slaves to carry it to the heaps . This night at midnight we road to Famagusta , which is eight leagues from Salina , which is 24 English miles . The 29 about two hours before day , we alighted at Famagusta . Famagusta , and after we were refreshed we went to see the town . This is a very fair strong hold , and the strongest and greatest in the Hand . The walls are fair and new , and strongly rampired with foure principali bulwarks , and between them turrions , responding one to another , these walls did the Venetians make . They have also on the haven side of it a Castle , and the haven is chained , the city hath only two gates ,
