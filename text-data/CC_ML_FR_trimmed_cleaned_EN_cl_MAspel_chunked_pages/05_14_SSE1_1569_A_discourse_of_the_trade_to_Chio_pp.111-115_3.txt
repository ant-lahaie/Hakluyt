then three kintals of galls for a carsie , and in England we sold them for 35 and 36 shillings the hundred . And whereas now they are brought by the Venetians , they fell them unto us for three pound tenne shillings , and foure pound the hundred . Also we had three kintals of cotton wool for a carsie , and sold the wool in England for 50 shillings or 3 pound at the most , whereas now the Italians fell the same to us v 113 h Diverse places where we may have sweet tiles fir our clothing far cheaper then out of Spaine . for 4 pound 10 shillings and 5 pound the hundred .

Also grogerams , where we had of the best , two pieces and a half for a carsie , they fell them for foure shillings and foure shillings and sixe pence the yard . Carpets the smaller sort which serve for cupboards , we had three for a carsie : whereas we at the most could not fell them but for 20 shillings the piece , they fell them for 35 shillings the piece . And so all other commodities that the Venetians do bring , they fell them to us for the third part more gains then we our selves in those days that we traded in those parts . Likewise the barrels of oil that they bring from Candia , we never could fell them above foure nobles the barrel ! , where they fell them always for 50 shillings & 3 pound the barrel .

Moreover , the Venetians come very little to Chio , for their most trade is into Alexandria . And for to assure you that we had these commodities in barter of our carsies , look into your father ' s books , and
