it is more perfect and clearer then the water of Nilus is . From the port Piqueno I went to Cochin , and from Cochin to Malacca , from whence I departed for Pegu being eight hundred miles distant . That voyage is wont to be made in five and twentie or thirtie days , but we were foure months , and at the end of three months our ship was without victuals . The Pilot told us that we were by his altitude not far from a city called Tanasary , in the kingdom of Pegu , and these his words were not true , but we were ( as it were ) in the middle of many Hands , and many uninhabited rocks , and there were also some Portugales that affirmed that they knew the land , and knew also where the city of Tanasari was . This city of right belongeth to the kingdom of Sion , which is situate on a great rivers side , which comes out of the kingdom of Sion : and where this river runneth into the sea , there is a village called Mirgim , Merchandise jn whose harbour every year there lade some ships with Xtrivaa . , Nypa , and Benjamin , a few cloves , nutmegs and maces which come from the coast of Sion , but the greatest merchandise there is Verzin and Nypa , which is and excellent wine , which is made of the flower of a tree called Nyper . Whose liquour they distil , and so make and excellent drink clear as crystal , good to the mouth , and better to the stomach , and it hath and excellent gentle virtue , that if one were rotten with the french pocks , drinking good store of this , he shall be 412 whole again , and I have seen it proved , because that when I was in Cochin , there was a friend of mine , whose nose began to drop away with that disease , and he was counseled of the doctors of physic , that he should go to Tanasary
