The letters of the Queens most excellent Majesty sent in the year 1596 unto the great Emperor of China by M . Richard Allot and M . Thomas Bromefield merchants of the city of London , who were embarked in a fleet of 3 ships , to wit , The Bear , The Bears whelp , and the Benjamin ; set forth principally at the charges of the honourable knight Sir Robert Duddely , and committed unto the command and conduct of M . Benjamin Wood , a man of approved skill in navigation : who , together with his ships and company ( because we have herd no certain news of them since the month of February next after their departure ) we do suppose , may be arrived upon some part of the coast of China , and may there be stayed by the said Emperor , or perhaps may have some treachery wrought against them by the Portugales of Macao , or the Spaniards of the Philippinas . 418 The same in English . ELizabeth by the grace of God Queen of England , France , and Ireland , the most mighty defendresse of the true & Christian faith against all that falsely profess the name of Christ etc . To the most high and sovereign Prince the most puissant Governor of the great kingdom of China , the chiefest Emperor in those parts of Asia and of the Hands adjoining , and the great monarch of the orientali regions of the world ; wishes health , and many joyful and happy years , with all plenty and abundance of things most acceptable . Whereas our honest and faithful subject ' s which bring these letters unto your Highness , Richard Allot & Thomas Bromefield , merchants of our city of London in our foresaid kingdom of England , have made most earnest suit unto us , that we would commend their desires and endeavours of sailing to the regions of your Empire for traffics sake : whereas also the fame of your kingdom so strongly and prudently governed , being dispersed and published over the face of the whole earth , hath invited these our subject ' s not only to visit your Highness dominions , but also to permit themselves to be ruled and governed by the laws and constitutions of your kingdom during the time of their abode in those parts of the world , as it becomes merchants , who for exchange of merchandise are desirous to travel 419 unto regions so far distant and not hitherto sufficiently known unto these nations of the world , having this regard only ,
