Delmenhorst : His most gracious Lord . Hat heroical attempt of Anchurus , son of King Midas ( most gracious prince ) and that piety towards his country in manner peerless , deserveth highly to be renowned in histories : in that freely and courageously he offered his own person , for the stopping up of and huge gulf of earth , about Celoena , a town in Phrigia , which daily swallowed multitudes of men , and whatsoever else came near unto it . For when his father Midas was advertised by the Oracle , that the said gulf should not be shut up , before things most precious were cast into it : Anchurus deeming nothing to be more invaluable then life , plunged himself alive down headlong into that bottomeles hold ; and that with so great vehemency of mind , that neither by his father ' s request nor by the allurements and tears of his most amiable wife , he suffered himself to be drawn back from this his enterprise . Sperthius also and Bulls , two Lacedæmonians , were not much inferior to the former , who to turn away the revenge of Xerxes that most puissant King of the 89 Persians , intended against the Lacedæmonians , for killing the ambassadors of his father Darius , hied them unto the said king , and that he might avenge the ambassadors death upon them , not upon their country , with hardy , and constant minds presented themselves before him . The very same thing ( most gracious prince ) which moved them , and many others being inflamed with the love of their country , to refuse for the benefit thereof , no danger , no trouble , no nor death it self , the same thing ( I say ) hath also inforced me , not indeed to undergo voluntary death , or freely to offer my self unto the slaughter , but yet to assay that which I am able for the good of my country : namely , that I may gather together and refute the errors , and vain reports
