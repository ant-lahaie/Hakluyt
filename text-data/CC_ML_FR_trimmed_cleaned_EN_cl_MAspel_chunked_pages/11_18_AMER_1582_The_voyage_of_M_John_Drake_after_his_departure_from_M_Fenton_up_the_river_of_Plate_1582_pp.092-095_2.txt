, not far from the place where the Earl of Cumberlands ships did take in fresh water , she was cast away upon a ledge of rocks : but the men were saved in their boat , which were in number 18 , who went ashore on the Northside , and went a days journey into the land , and met with the Savages which are no men - eaters , but take all the Christians that they can , and make them slaves . But the Englishmen fought with them and the Savages slew five of them , and took 13 alive , which were with the Savages about 15 months . But the Master of the pinnace , whose name was Richard Faireweather being not willing to endure the misery that he was in , and having knowledge that there was a town of Christians on the other side of the river , he in a night called John Drake , 94 1583 - and another young man which was with them , and took a very little Canoa , which had but two oars , & so passed to the other side of the river , which is about 19 leagues broad , and were three days before they could get over without meat : and coming to land , they hit upon and high way that went towards the Christians : and seeing the footing of horses , they followed it , and at last came to and house where there was corn sowed , and there they met with Indians servants unto the Spaniards , which gave them meat , and clothes to cover them , for they were all naked , and one of the Indians went to the town , and told them of the Englishmen ; so the Captain sent foure horsemen , who brought them to the town behind them . This Captain clothed them , and provided lodging for them , and John Drake dieted at the Captains table , and they were all very well entreated , the Captain purposing to send them for Spaine . But the Viceroy of Peru having John Drake news hereof , sent for them , and so John Drake was sent s ^ tot , ier to him , but the other two were kept there , because they peru J were married in the country , so that I know no more of their affairs . Upon this coming of the Englishmen , there were prepared 50 horsemen to go over the river to seek the rest of the Englishmen , and also certain Spaniards that were among the savage people , but I am not certain , whither they went forward or not .
