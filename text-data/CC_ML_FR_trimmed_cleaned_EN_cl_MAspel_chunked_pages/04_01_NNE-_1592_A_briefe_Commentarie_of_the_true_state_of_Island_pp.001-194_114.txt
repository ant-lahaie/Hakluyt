part these my labours employed in thy service , and accept them with that favourable and courteous mind which I have expected . And although they be not of such worth as I could wish , yet sith a willing mind is worth all , I would not therefore give over because I mistrusted my self as one insufficient to contend for thine innocence , for thy reputation , and thine honour , my deer Country . But rather whatsoever it be ( if it be ought ) and how mickle - soever which for my slender ability I was able to afford in thy defence , I thought good not to suppress it : for I esteem not those men worthy of commendation , who despairing To overgrow the limbs of Lyco stout , Neglect to cure their bodies of the gout . And in very deed , it doth not whit repent me of my labour , if this little treatise shall tend neither to thine nor to mine own disgrace . But if it shall any iv 193 N thing avail to thine honour or defence , I will think my travail right well bestowed . Yea , if by this my slender attempt I may but only excite other of thy children , and my native Countrymen , being far my superiors both in learning and industry to take thy cause in hand , either now or hereafter , what reason is there why any man should say that it is not worth my labour ? Now , if they address themselves to write , howsoever my fame shall obscured , yet will I comfort my self with their excellency , who are like to impair my credit : for albeit a man ought to have speciali regard of his name and fame , yet is he to have more of his Country , whose dignity being safe and found , we also must needs esteem our selves to be in safety .
