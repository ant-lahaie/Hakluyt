knoweth , that even now we are too much wearied and disquieted with the importunate and instant complaints of our subject ' s , insomuch that we cannot at this present by any convenient means release or dissolve the said prohibition , before we be sufficiently informed by your majesties ambassadors , of the satisfaction of our endamaged subject ' s . Furthermore , whereas your majesties request , concerning your subject ' s that shall come unto the parts of Sconia , is that we would defend them under our protection : be it known unto your highness , that for diverse considerations us reasonably Margaret moving , being provoked by the queen of Denmarke ^ Denm an ber PeoP ^ e > being also urged thereunto full soar ' against our wills , for the repelling and avoiding of injuries , we have sent forth our army against them . Howbeit for a certain time a truce is concluded on both parts , so that our people are actually returned home . Far be it from us also , that our subject ' s being occupied in wars , should in any sort willingly molest or reproach any strangers , of what lands or nations soever , not being our professed enemies . For this should be to oppress the innocent in stead of the guilty , to condemn the just for the unjust : then which nothing can be more cruel , nor a revenge of greater impiety . In very deed ( most gracious prince and lord ) we are moved with right hearty sympathy and compassion for any inconvenience which might happen in your regiment : wishing from the bottom of our hearts , that all affairs may right prosperously and happily succeed , about the royal person and regiment of your most excellent Majestic , and that continually . The like whereof we hope from you : most humbly commending our selves , and our whole Order unto your highness . Given at our castle of Marienburgh , the 16 . day the month of July , in the year of our Lord 1404 .
