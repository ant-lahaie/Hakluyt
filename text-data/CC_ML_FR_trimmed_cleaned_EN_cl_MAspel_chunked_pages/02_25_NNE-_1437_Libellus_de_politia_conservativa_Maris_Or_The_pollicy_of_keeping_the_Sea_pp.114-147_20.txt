to me full late . Which was a lord of full great estate ; Than expense of one year done in France Warred on men well willed of puissance This said ground of Ireland to conquer . And yet because England might not forbear These said expenses gathered in one year , But in three years or foure gathered up here , Might win Ireland to a finali conquest , In one sole year to set us all at rest . And how soon would this be paid again : Which were it worth yearly , if we not feyne : 135 This Lord was the Earl of Ormond that told to me this matter , that he would undertake it , in pain of loss of all his livelihood . But this proffer could not be admitted . Ergo mall . I will declare , who so lust to look , I trow full plainly in my little book . But covetise , and singularity Of own profit , envy , cruelty , Hath done us harm , and do us every day , And musters made that shame is to say : Our money spent all to little avail , And our enemies so greatly done prevail , That what harm may fallen and overthwerte I may uneath write more for soar of heart . And exhortation to the keeping of Wales . BEware of Wales , Christ Jesu mutt us keep , That it make not our childers child to weep , Ne us also , so if it go his way , By unwarenes : seth that many a day Men have bee ferde of her rebellion , By great tokens and ostentation : Seche the means with a discrete avise , And help that they rudely not arise For to rebel , that Christ it forbid . Look well about , for God wot ye have need , Unfeigning , unfeyning and unfeint , That conscience for slought you not attaint : Keep well that ground , for harm that may ben used , Or afore God mutte ye been accused .
