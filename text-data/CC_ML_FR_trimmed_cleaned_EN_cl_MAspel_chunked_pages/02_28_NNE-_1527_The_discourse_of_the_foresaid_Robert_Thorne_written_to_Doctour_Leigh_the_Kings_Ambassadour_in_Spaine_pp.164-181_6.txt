certain Islands of the Canaries , and Islands of Capo verde . But the first main land next to the line Equinoctial is the said Capo verde , and from thence Northward by the straight of this sea of Italie . And so follows Spayne , France , Flanders , Almain , Denmarke , and Norway , which is the highest part towards the North . And over against Flanders are our Islands of England and Ireland . Of the lands and coasts within the straights I have set out only the Regions , dividing them by lines of their limits , by which plainly I think your Lordship may see , in what situation every region is , and of what highness , and with what regions it is joined .

And by this Cape go the Portingals to their Spicery . For from this Cape towards the 169 Orient , is the land of Calicut , as your Lordship may see in the headland over against the 130 . degree . From the said Cape of Buona speransa the coast returns towards the line Equinoctial , and passing forth entereth the read sea , & returning out , entereth again into the gulf of Persia , and returns towards the Equinoctial line , till that it comes to the headland called Calicut aforesaid , and from thence the coast making a gulf , where is the river of Ganges , returns towards the line to a headland called Malaca , where is the principali Spicery : & from this Cape returns
