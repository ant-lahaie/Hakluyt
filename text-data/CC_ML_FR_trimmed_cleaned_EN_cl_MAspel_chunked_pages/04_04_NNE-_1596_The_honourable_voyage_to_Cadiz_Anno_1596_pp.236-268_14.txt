Of them all two fair ships only were boarded and taken by our men with most part of their furniture in them , the one called S . Matthy , a ship by estimation of some xii . hundred tun , and the other S . Andrew , being a ship of not much lesser burden . The Galleys , seeing this sudden great victorious overthrow , made all the haste they could towards the Bridge called Puente de Sua ? oh , and there shrouded themselves in such sort as our ships could not by any means possible come nigh them for lack of water . The Spanish ships in all were lix . & as is said , all tall ships & very richly furnished and well appointed , whereof some of them were bound for the Indies , and other freighted and furnished for Lisbon , as themselves affirm : and had we not come that very time that we did , ( which for my part , I do not attribute so much unto mere chance , as to some secret deep insight and foreknowledge of the two most worthy Lords general , who no doubt spared for no cost or labour for true intelligence ) we had certainly missed of them all . Of what great wealth and riches these ships were , that I leave to other men ' s judgement and report , but sure I am , that themselves offered two millions and a half of ducats for the redemption of the goods and riches that were in them : which offer of theirs , albeit it was accepted of the Lords general , and should have been received , yet we were defeated of it , as hereafter shall be more at large declared . What manner of fight this was , & with what courage performed , and with what terror to the beholders continued , where so many thundering tearing pieces were for so long a time discharged , I leave it to the Reader to think & imagine .
