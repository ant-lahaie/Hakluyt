in a gown of crimson damask , and other very brave apparel , and five or sixe other gentlemen richly appareled also . They having the Turks safe conduct , showed it to the captain of the galleys , and laid it upon his head , charging him to obey it : so with much ado , and with the gift of 100 pieces of gold we were quit of them , and had our man again . That day as aforesaid , we came to Missagh , and there Candie . 213 stayed eight days , and at last departed towards Candie , with a scant wind . The 11 day of October we were boarded with foure galleys , manned with 1200 men , which also made a sleeveless arrant , and troubled us very much , but our captains passport , and the gift of 100 chekins discharged all . Zante , The 27 of October we passed by Zante with a merry wind , the 29 by Corfu , and the third of November we arrived at Istria , and there we left our great ship , and took small boats to bring us to Venice . The 9 of November I arrived again at Venice in good health , where I stayed nine days , and the 25 of the same month I came to Augusta , and stayed there but one day . The 27 of November I set towards Nuremberg where I came the 29 , and there stayed till the 9 of December , and was very well entertained of the English merchants there : and the governors of the town sent me and my company sixteene gallons of excellent good wine . From thence I went to Frankford , from Frankford to Collen , from Collen to Arnam , from Arnam to Utreight , from Utreight to Dort , from Dort to Antwerpe , from Antwerpe to Flushing , from Flushing to London , where I arrived upon Twelfe eve in safety , and gave thanks to God , having finished my journey to Jerusalem and home again , in the space of nine months and five days .
