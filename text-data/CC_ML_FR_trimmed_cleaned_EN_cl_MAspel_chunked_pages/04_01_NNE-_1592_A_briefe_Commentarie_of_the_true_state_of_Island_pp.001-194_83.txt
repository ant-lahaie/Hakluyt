( say he ) we will so expound it with the Civilians , namely that we comprehend under the word of Victus all things necessary for the life of man , as meat , drink , attire of the body , etc . And Ulpianus de verborum signification defineth Victus in the very same words . But in this place the said authors call beasts meat by the name of Victus . But let us see what truth and plain dealing is to be found in these men . We have no labouring cattle beside horses and oxen : these have grass and hay ( except where hay is wanting ) for their fodder , and water to drink .

Island ( says he ) containeth many people living only with the food of cattle , and sometime by taking of fish . But what else is the food of cattle , but the meat of cattle , says Doletus ?
