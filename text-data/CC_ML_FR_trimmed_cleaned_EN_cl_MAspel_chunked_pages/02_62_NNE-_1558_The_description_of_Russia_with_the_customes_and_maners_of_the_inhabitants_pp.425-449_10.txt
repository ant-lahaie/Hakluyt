10 or 12 are of white damask , set and embroidered round about with fair and orient pearls , as great as peas , and among them certain Sapphires and other stones . After them followed the one half of the Emperors noble men : then comes the Emperor ' s majesty and the Metropolitan , after this manner . First , there is a horse covered with white linen cloth down to you ground , his ears being made long with the same cloth like to and asses ears . Upon this horse the Metropolitan sitteth sidelong like a woman : in his lap lies a fair book , with a crucifix of Goldsmiths work upon the cover , which he holds fast with his left hand , and in his right hand he hath a cross of gold , with 434 which cross he ceases not to bless the people as he rides . There are to the number of 30 men which spread abroad their garments before the horse , and as soon as the horse is passed over any of them , they take them up again and run before , and spread them again , so that the horse does always go on some of them . They which spread the garments are all priests sons , and for their labours the Emperor gives unto them new garments . One of the Emperor ' s noble men leads the horse by the head , but the Emperor himself going on foot leads the horse by the end of the reine of his bridle with one of his hands , and in the other of his hands he had a branch of a Palm tree : after this followed the rest of the Emperors Noble men and Gentlemen , with a great number of other people . In this order they went from one church to another within the castle , about the distance of two flights shot : and so returned again to the Emperors Church , where they made and end of their service . Which being done , the Emperors majesty and certain of his noble men went to the Metropolitan his house to dinner
