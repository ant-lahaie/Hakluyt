descendeth perpendicular upon the 175 degree , & the other in the Orientali on the 170 degree , whose distance measureth the scale of longitude . And that which is without the two said transversali lines , is only to show how the Orientali part is joined with the Occident , and Occident with the Orient . For that that is set without the line in the Oriental part , is the same that is set within the other line in the Occidentali part : and that that is set without the line in the Occidentali part , is the same that is set within the line in the Orientali part , to show that though this figure of the world in plain or flat seems to have and end , yet one imagining that this said Carded were set upon a round thing , where the ends should touch by the lines , it would plainly appear how the Orient part joineth with the Occident , as there without the lines it is described and figured .

Which main land or coast goes Northward , and finisheth in the land that we found , which is called here Terra de Labrador .
