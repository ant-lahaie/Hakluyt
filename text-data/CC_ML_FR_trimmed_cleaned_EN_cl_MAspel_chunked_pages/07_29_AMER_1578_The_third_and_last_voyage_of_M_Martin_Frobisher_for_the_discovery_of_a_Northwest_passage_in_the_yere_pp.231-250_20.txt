in the mouth of some notable river , or upon the point of the land entering into the river , if no such Island be , were to great end . For if such river were navigable or portable far into the land , then would arise great hope of planting in fertile soils , and traffic on the one or on the other side of the river , or on both , or the linking in amity with one or other petty king contending there for dominion . Such rivers found , both Barges and Boats may be made for the safe passage of such as shall pierce the same . These are to be covered with doubles of course linen artificially wrought , to defend the arrow or the dart of the savage from the rower . Since every soil of the world by art may be made to yield things to feed and to cloth man , bring in your return a perfect note of the soil without and within , and we shall devise if need require to amend the Same , and to draw it to more perfection . And if you find not fruits in your planting place to your liking , we shall in five drifats furnish you with such kinds of plants to be carried thither the winter after your planting , as shall the very next summer following yield you some fruit , and 249 the year next following , as much as shall suffice a town as big as Calice , and that shortly after shall be able to yield you great store of strong durable good sider to drink , and these trees shall be able to increase you within less then seven years as many trees presently to bear , as may suffice the people of diverse parishes , which at the first settling may stand you in great stead , if the soil have not the commodity of fruits of goodness already . And because you ought greedily to hunt after things that yield present relief , without trouble of carriage thither , therefore I make mention of these thus specially , to the end you may have it specially in mind .
