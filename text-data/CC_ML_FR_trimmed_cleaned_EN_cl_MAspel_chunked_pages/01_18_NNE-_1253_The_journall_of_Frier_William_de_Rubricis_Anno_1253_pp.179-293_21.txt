their execution of justice and judgement : and of their death ' s and burials . Chap . 10 . Concerning their laws or their execution of justice , your Majesty is to be advertised , that when two men fight , no third man dare intrude â€¢ himself to part them . Yea , the father dare not help his own son . But he that goes by the worst must appeal unto the court of his lord . And whosoever else ofFereth him any violence after appeal , is put to death . But he must go presently without all delay : and he that hath suffered the injury , carrieth him , as it were captive . They punish no man with sentence of death , unless he be taken in the deed doing , or confesses the same . But being accused by the multitude , they put him unto extreme torture to make him confess the truth . They punish murder with death , and carnali copulation also with any other beside his own . By his own , I mean his wife or his maid servant , for he may use his slave as he lists himself . Heinous theft also or felony they punish with death . For a light theft , as namely for stealing of a ram , the party ( not being apprehended in the deed doing , but otherwise detected ) is cruelly beaten . And if you executioner lays on and 100 . strokes , he must have and 100 . staves , namely for such as are beaten upon sentence given in the court . Also counterfeit messengers , because they feign themselves to be messengers , when as indeed they are none at all , they punish with death . Sacrilegious persons they use in like manner ( of which kind of malefactors your Majesty shall understand more fully hereafter ) because they esteem such to be witches . When any man dieth , they lament & howl most pitifully for him : & the said mourners are free from paying any tribute for one whole year after . Also
