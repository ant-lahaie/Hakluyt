and a strong bulwark , and a fair Cathedral church , with a bishop and other dignities thereunto appertaining . There is also justice and government according to the Portugall use . But causes of appellation are remitted to the city of Lisbone in Portugall to the kings superior judges there . This Hand hath another town called Machico , which hath likewise a good road for ships , which town and road were so called after the name of Macham the Englishman , who first discovered the same . There are also sixteene sugar houses called Ingenios , which make excellent good sugar . There is beside the goodly timber before declared , great store of diverse sorts of fruits , as Pears , Apples , Plums , wild Dates , Peaches of diverse sorts , Mellons , Batatas , Oranges , Lemons , Pomgranates , Citrons , Figs , and all manner of garden herbs . There are many Dragon trees , such as grow in the Canary Hands , but chiefly this land produceth great quantity of singular good wines which are laden for many places . On the North side of this land three leagues distant from the main Hand stands another little Hand called Porto santo : the people thereof lives by husbandry , for the Hand of Madera yields but little corn , but rather is thereof provided out of France and from the Hand of Tenerif . On the East side of the He of Madera sixe leagues distant stands another little Hand called the Desert , which produceth only Orchell , and nourishes a great number of Goats , for the provision of the main Hand , which may be thirtie leagues in circuit : and the land is of great 135 A . D . c . 1550 . heighth where the foresaid trees grow . It is wonder to see the conveyance of the water to the Ingenios by Mines through the mountains . In the mid way between Tenerif and the Hand of Madera stands a little solitary Hand called the Salvages , which may be about one league in compass , which hath neither tree nor fruit , but is only food for Goats .
