Underneath the aforesaid unperfect relation that which follows is written in another letter sent to M . John Growte student in Paris from Jaques Noel of S . Malo , the grand nephew of Jaques Cartier . Can write nothing else unto you of any thing that I can recover of the writings of Captain Jaques Cartier my uncle diseased , although I have made search in all places that I could possibly in this Town : saving of a certain book made in manner of a sea Chart , which was drawn by the hand of my said uncle , which is in the possession of master Cremeur : which book is passing vin 273 s well marked and drawn for all the River of Canada , whereof I am well assured , because I my self have knowledge thereof as far as to the Saults , where I have be : The Saults are The height of which Saults is in 44 . degrees . I found in sa ^ Chart beyond the place where the River is â€™ ' divided in twaine in the midst of both the branches of the said river somewhat nearest that arm which runneth towards the Northwest , these words following written in the hand of Jaques Cartier . By the people of Canada and Hochelaga it was said , That here is the land of Saguenay , which is rich and wealthy in precious stones . And about and hundred leagues under the same 1 found written these two lines following in the said Card inclining towards the Southwest . Here in this Country are Cinnamon and Cloves , which they call in their language Canodeta . Touching the effect of my book whereof I spoke unto you , it is made after the manner of a sea Chart , which I have delivered to my two sons Michael and John , which at this present are in Canada . If at their return , which will be God willing about Magdalene tIED , they have learned any new thing worthy the writing , I will not fail to advertise you thereof . Your loving Friend , Jaques Noel .
