be travailed , and reach so far into the North , that they make the unknown land of Engron - land . The Duke of Moscovia , Basilius the son of John , sent on a time two of his Captains , nam Simeon Pheodorowich Kurbski , 8c Knes Peter Uschatoi , to search the places beyond these mountains , and to subdue the nations thereabouts . Kurbski was yet alive at my being in Moscovia , 8c declared unto me that he spent xvii . days in ascending the mountain , 8c yet could not come to the top thereof , which in their tongue is called Stolp , that is , a pillar . This mountain is extended into the Ocean unto the mouths of the rivers of Dwina and Petzora . But now having spoken thus much of the said journey , I will return to the dominions of Moscovia , with other regions lying Eastward 8c South from the same , 411 Jaroslave . Hony . La region delle Cine . Confini deUi ultimi Tartari . towards the mighty Empire of Cathay . But I will first speak somewhat briefly of the province of Rezan , and the famous river of Tanais . The province of Rezan , situate between the rivers of Occa and Tanais , hath a ci tie built of wood , not far from the bank of Occa : there was in it a Castle nam Jaroslave , whereof there now remains nothing but tokens of the old ruin . Not far from that city the river Occa makes and Hand nam Strub , which was sometime a great Dukedom , whose prince was subject to none other . This province of Rezan is more fruitful then any other of the provinces of Moscovia : Insomuch that in this ( as they say ) every grain of wheat brings forth two , and sometime more ears : whose stalks or straws grow so thick that horses can scarcely go through them , or Quails fly out of them . There is great plenty of honey , fish , fowls , birds , and wild beasts . The fruits also do far exceed the fruits of Moscovia . The people are bold and warlike men .
