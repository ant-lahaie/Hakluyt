, and they have reaped the fruits of my travail . But ever my prayer was to God , to deliver me out of those misery ' s which I suffered for your service among those heathen people . Therefore knowing my duty which I have done , as a true servant ought to do , I beseech your worships ( although I have but small recompense for my service , ) yet let me have no wrong , and God will prosper you the better . Also , to inform your worships of your Persian voyage what I judge : it is a voyage to be followed . The king of Gillan , whereas yet you have had no traffic , lives all by merchandise : and it is near Casbin , and not passed six weeks travail from Ormus , whither all the spices be brought : and here , ( I mean at Gillan ) a trade may be established : But your worships must send such men as are no riotous livers , nor drunkards . For if such men go , it will be to your dishonour and great hindrance , as appeared by experience the year 1565 . when as Richard Johnson went to Persia , whose journey had be better stayed then set forward . For whereas before we had the name among those heathen people to be such merchants as they thought none like in all respects , his vicious living there hath made us to be counted worse then the Russes . Again , if such men travail in your affairs in such a voyage , you shall never know what gain is to be got . For how can such men employ themselves to seek the trade , that are inclined to such vices ? or how 43 A . D . 1565 . [ I - 354 - 1 Gillan in Per sia . can God prosper them in your affairs ? But when a trade is established by wise and discreet men , then will it be for your worships to traffic there , and not before : for a voyage or market made evil at the first , is the occasion that your worships shall never understand what gain is to be got thereby hereafter .
