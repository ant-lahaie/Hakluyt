of coals , so do they their fish . Upon Magdalens day we with our boats went to the bank of the river , and freely went on shore among them , whereat they made many signs , and all their men in two or three companies began to sing and dance , seeming to be very glad of our coming . They had caused all the young women to flee into the wood , two or three excepted , that stayed with them , to each of which we gave a comb , and a little bell made of Tin , for which they were very glad , thanking our Captain , rubbing his arms and breasts with their hands . When the men saw us give something unto those that had stayed , it caused all the rest to come out of the wood , to the end they should have as much as the others : These women were about twenty , who altogether in a knot fell upon our Captain , touching and rubbing him with their hands , according to their manner of cherishing and making much of one , who gave to each of them a little Tin bell : then suddenly they began to dance , and sing many songs . There we found great store of Mackrels , that they had taken upon the shore , with certain nets that they make to fish , of a kind of Hemfe . Hemp that grows in that place where ordinarily they abide , for they never come to the sea , but only in fishing time . As far as I understand , there grows likewise a 202 kind of Millet as big as Peason , like unto that which Maiz . grows in Bresil , which they eat in stead of bred . They had great store of it . They call it in their tongue Kapaige . They have also Prunes ( that is to say Dam - Tamsins , figs , sins ) which they dry for winter as we do , they call them a ^ es - Honesta .
