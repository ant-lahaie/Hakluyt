their private houses , and of the apparel of the people . THe common houses of the country are every where built of beams of Fir tree : the lower beams do so receive the round holownesse of the uppermost , that by the means of the building thereupon , they resist , and expel all winds that blow , and where the timber is joined together , there they stop the chinks with moss . The form & fashion of their houses in all places is foure square , with strait and narrow windows , whereby with a transparent casement made or covered with skin like to parchment , they Aurea vetula , or Zelotibaba . receive the light . The roofs of their houses are made of boards covered without with you bark of trees : within their houses they have benches or griezes hard by their walls , which commonly they sleep upon , for the common people know not the use of beds : they have stooves wherein in the morning they make a fire , and the same fire does either moderately warm , or make very hight the whole house . The apparel of the people for the most part is made of wool , their caps are picked like unto a rike or diamond , broad beneath , and sharp upward . In the manner of making whereof , there is a sign and representation of nobility : for the loftier or higher their caps are , the greater is their birth supposed to be , and the greater reverence is given them by the common people .
