Their footmen ( because otherwise they want order in leading ) are commonly placed in some ambush or place of advantage , where they may most annoy the enemy , with least hurt to themselves . If it be a set battle , or if any great invasion be made upon the Russe borders by the Tartar , they are set within you running or moving Castle ( called Beza , or Gulaygorod ) which is carried about with them by the Voiavoda gulavoy ( or the walking General ) whom I spoke of before . This walking or moving Castle is so framed , that it may be set up in length ( as occasion doth require ) the space of one , two , three , foure , five , sixe , or seven miles : for so long it will reach . It is nothing else but a double wall of wood to defend them on both sides behind and before , with a space of three yards or thereabouts , betwixt the two sides : so that they may stand within it , and have room enough to charge and discharge their pieces , and to use their other weapons . It is closed at both ends , and made with loop holes on either side , to lay out the nose of their piece , or to push forth any other weapon . It is carried with the army wheresoever it goes , being taken into pieces , and so laid on carts sparred together , and drawn by horse that are not 384 seen , by reason that they are covered with their carriage as with a shelf or penthouse . When if ' is brought to the place where it is to be used ( which is devised and chosen out before by the walking Voiavod ) it is planted so much as the present use requires , sometime a mile long , sometime two , sometime three or more : Which is soon done without the help of any Carpenter , or instrument : because the timber is so framed to clasp together one piece within another
