Shipwright on work to built two ships for the same discovery upon the river of Dwina . The passage unto Cathay by the Northeast ( as he de - clareth the matter , albeit without art , yet very aptly , as you may well perceive , which I request you diligently to consider ) is without doubt very short and easy .

Whereupon about the end of May he is determined to sail from the Bay of S . Nicholas Eastward , by the 454 main of Joughoria , and so to the Easterly parts of Pechora , & to the Island which is called Dolgoia . And Island of here also he is purposed to observe the latitudes , to Dol & ia . survey and describe the country , to found the depth of the Sea , and to note the distances of places , where , and so oft as occasion shall be offered . And forasmuch as the Bay of Pechora is a most convenient place both for harbour and victuali , as well in their going forth as in their return home in regard of Ice and tempest , he is determined to bestow a day in sounding the Flats , and in searching out the best entrance for ships :
