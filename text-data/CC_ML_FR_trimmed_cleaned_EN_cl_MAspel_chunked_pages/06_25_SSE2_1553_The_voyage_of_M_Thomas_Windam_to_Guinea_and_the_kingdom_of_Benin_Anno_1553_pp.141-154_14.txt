The Secretary ' s note . Entered in the book of the Matricula . Fol . 683 . Francisco de Siquera . The copy of the letter of DONE Lewes the infant , and brother to the king of Portugall , sent into England to Anthonie Anes Pinteado . ANthony Anes Pinteado , I the infant brother to the king , have me heartily commended unto you . Peter Gonsalves is gone to seek you , desiring to bring you home again into your country . And for that purpose he hath with him a safe conduct for you , granted by the 153 king , that thereby you may freely and without all fear come home . And although the weather be foul and stormy , yet fade not to come : for in the time that his Majesty hath given you , you may do many things to your contentation and gratifying the king , whereof I would be right glad : and to bring the same to pass , I will do all that lies in me for your profit . But Forasmuch as Peter Gonsalves will make further declaration hereof unto you , I say no more at this present . Written in Lisbone , the eight day of December . Anno 1552 . The infant DONE Lewes . A LI these foresaid writings I saw under seal , in the house of my friend Nicholas Liese , with whom Pinteado left them , at his unfortunate departing to Guinea . But , notwithstanding all these friendly letters and fair promises , Pinteado durst not attempt to go home , neither to keep company with the Portugals his country men , without the - presence of other : forasmuch as he had secret admonitions that they intended to slay him , if time and place might have served their wicked intent .
