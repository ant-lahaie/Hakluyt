Number de Dios to Panama is 17 leagues distance : from which town there runneth a river which is called the river of Chagre , which runneth within 5 leagues of Panama , to a place called Cruzes , thorough which river they carry their goods , and disembark them at the said Cruzes , and from thence they are conveyed on mules backs to Panama by land ; where they again 368 embark them in certain small ships in the South sea for all the coast of Peru . In one of these ships I went to Potossi , and from thence by land to Cusco , and from Potosi . thence to Paita . Here I remained the space of seven months , and then returned into the kingdom of Guatimala , and arrived in the province of Nicoia , and Nicaragua . From Nicaragua I traveled by land to a province called Nicamula ( which lies towards the North sea in certain high mountains ) for that I could not pass thorough the kingdom of Guatimala at that time for waters , wherewith all the Low countries ' of the province of Soconusco , lying by the South sea , are drowned with the rain that falls above in the mountains , enduring always from April to September : which season for that cause they call their Winter . From this province I came into another called De Vera Paz , in which the chiefest city is also Vera Paz . called after that name , where there dwells a bishop and about forty Spanyards . Among the mountains of this country towards the North sea , there is a province called La Candona , where are Indian men of war which the king can not subdue , for that they have towns and forts in a great lake of water above in the said mountains : the most part of them go naked , and some wear mantles of cotton wool . Distant from this about 80 leagues , I came into another province called the province of Chiapa , wherein the chiefest city is called Sacatlan ,
