MY Lord Admiral of Chastillon , a noble man more desirous of the public then of his private benefit , understanding the pleasure of the King his prince , which was to discover new and strange Countries ' , caused vessels fit for this purpose to be made ready with all diligence , and men to be levied meet for such and enterprise : Among whom he chosen Captain John Ribault , a man in truth expert in sea causes : which having received his charge , set himself to Sea the year 1562 . the eighteenth of Februarie , accompanied only with two of the kings ships , but so well furnished with Gentlemen , ( of whose number I my self was one ) and with old Soldiers , that he had means to achieve some notable thing and worthy of eternal memory . Having therefore sailed two months , never holding the usual course of the Spaniards , he arrived in Florida , landing near a Cape or Promontory , which is no high land , because the coast is all flat , but only rising by reason of the high woods , which at his arrival he called Cape Francois in honour of our France . This Cape is distant from the Equator about thirtie degrees . Coasting from this place towards the North , he discovered a very fair and great River , which gave him occasion to cast anchor that he might search the same the next day very early in the morning : which being done by the break of day , accompanied with Captain Fiquinville and diverse other soldiers of his ship , he was no sooner arrived on the brink of the shore , but straight he perceived many Indians men and women , which came of purpose to that place to receive the Frenchmen with all gentleness and amity , as they well declared by the Oration which their king made , and the presents of Chamois skins wherewith he honoured our Captain , which the day following caused a pillar of hard stone to be planted within the said River , and not far from the mouth of the same upon a little sandy knap
