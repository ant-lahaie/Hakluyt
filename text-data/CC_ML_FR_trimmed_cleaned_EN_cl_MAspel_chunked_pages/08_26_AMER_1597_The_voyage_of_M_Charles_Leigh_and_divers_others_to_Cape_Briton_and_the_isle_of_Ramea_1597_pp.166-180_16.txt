drew out our reasons the fourth day of August , and sent them aboard the Hopewell , to certify them the cause of our resolution for England : whereat they were generally offended , thinking and saying , that we in the prize went about to cousin and deceive them . To conclude , they sent us 179 word that they would keep us company for England . But I had given William Crafton commission before to go for the Islands of the Azores , and there to spend his victuals for a man of war . The next day being the fift of August , having a fair wind , we put off from the coast of Newfoundland , and kept our course directly for England , the Hopewell keeping us company until midday , whenas having lost us in a fog , she shot off two pieces of ordinance , and we answered her with three : afterwards we spoke not with her , supposing that she went for the Islands . The 27 of August , drawing near the coast of England , we sounded and found ground at seventy fathoms . Some of the mariners thinking we were in Bristow channel , and other in Silly channel : so that through variety of judgements , and evil marinership we were feign to dance the hay foure days together , sometime running to the Northeast , sometime to the Southeast , then again to the East , and Eastnortheast . Thus did we spend fair winds , and loose our time until the last of August . And then it pleased God that we fell with the Island of Lundy within the channel of Bristoll ; from whence we shaped our course : and after diverse dangers , the third of September we met with the Tramontane of the Queen off of Dartmouth ; to the captain whereof we gave certain things that he had need of . The fift of September I landed on the outside of the Isle of Wight , and within few days after it pleased God to bring the ship in safety to London , where she was made prize as belonging to the enemies of this land .
