by the king of Hircan , I have already delivered unto you . Sojourning all that winter at Mosco , and in the mean time having bargained with the Emperors Majesty , I sent away your servant Edward Clarke hither overland with advice , and also made preparation for sending again into Persia in meet time of the year . And committing the charge thereof unto your servants Thomas Alcocke , George Wren , and Richard Cheinie , the 28 . of June last , I departed in post from the said Mosco , and coming to Colmogro and so down to the Sea side , I found your ships laden and ready to depart , where I embarked my self in your good ship called the Swallow , the 9 . of July , one thousand five hundred sixtie foure , and having passed the Seas with great and extreme dangers of loss 28 . Septemb . of ship , goods and life , the 28 . day of September G6 ! - last ( God be praised ) we arrived here at London in safety . Thus knowing that the courageous and valiant soldier , which adventureth both fame , member and life , to serve faithfully his sovereign , esteems not the perils and dangers passed ( the victory once obtained ) neither for his guerdon desires any thing more , then that his service be well taken of him for whom he enterprised it : So I perceiving your favourable benevolence to me extended in accepting my travels in good part to your contentations , do think my self therewith in great part recompensed : beseeching Almighty God so to prosper your adventures , from time to time hereafter to be made for reaping the fruits of my travels ( at your great charges , and to my no small dangers ) that you may plentifully gather in and enjoy the same , to the illustrating of the Queens most excellent Majesty , the honour and commodity of this her highness Realm , and to the ample benefit and abundant enriching of you and your succession , & posterity for ever .
