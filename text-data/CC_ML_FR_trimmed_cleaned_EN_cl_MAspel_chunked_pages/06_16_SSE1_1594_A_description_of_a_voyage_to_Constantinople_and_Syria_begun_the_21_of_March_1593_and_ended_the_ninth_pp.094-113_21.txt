say there is a small bone in the neck which would never be consumed : or if he were eaten by a beast , that bone would not consume , but of that bone would come another man ; and then the soul being restored again , he should come into judgement , whereas now , the body being destroyed , the soul shall not be judged : for their opinion is , that both body and soul must be united together , as they have sinned together , to receive 112 judgement ; and therefore the soul alone cannot . Their seven precepts which they keep so strictly are not for any hope of reward they have after this life , but only that they may be blessed in this world , for they think that he which breaks them shall have ill success in all his business . They say , the three chief religions in the world be of the Christians , Jewes , & Turks , & yet but one of them true : but being in doubt which is the truest of the three , they will be of none : for they hold that all these three shall be judged , and but few of them which be of the true shall be saved , the examination shall be so straight ; and therefore , as I have said before , to prevent this judgement , they burn their bodies to ashes . They say , these three religions have too many precepts to keep them all well , & therefore wondered hard it will be to make account , because so few do observe all their religion aright . And thus passing the time for the space of three months in this sea voyage , [ II i . 311 . ] we arrived at Venice the tenth of June : and after I had seen Padua , with other English men , I came the ordinary way over the Alpes , by Augusta , Noremberg , and so for England ; where to the praise of God I safely arrived the ninth of August 1595 .
