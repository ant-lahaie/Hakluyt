called the Green mount , having a most royal and sumptuous palace standing thereupon , in which , for the most part , the great Can is resident . Upon the one side of the 429 Karamoron . Sumacoto . said mount there is a great lake , whereupon a most stately bridge is built , in which lake is great abundance of geese , ducks , and all kinds of water fowls : and in the wood growing upon the mount there is great store of all birds , and wild beasts . And therefore when the great Can will solace himself with hunting or hawking , he needs not so much as once to step forth of his palace . Moreover , the principali palace , wherein he makes his abided , is very large , having within it 14 pillars of gold , and all the walls thereof are hanged with read skins , which are said to be the most costly skins in all the world . In the midst of the palace stands a cistern of two yards high , which consisteth of a precious stone called Merdochas , and is wreathed about with gold , & at each corner thereof is the golden image of a serpent , as it were , furiously shaking and casting forth his head . This cistern also hath a kind of network of pearl wrought about it . Likewise by the said cistern there is drink conveyed thorough certain pipes and conducts , such as uses to be drunk in the emperor ' s court , upon the which also there hang many vessels of gold , wherein , whosoever will may drink of the said liquour . In the foresaid palace there are many peacocks of gold : & when any Tartar makes a banquet unto his lord , if the guests chance to clap their hands for joy and mirth , the said golden peacocks also will spread abroad their wings , and lift up their trains , seeming as if they danced : and this I suppose to be done by art magic or by some secret engine under the ground .
