confessed , that some particular living creature cannot live in every particular place or region , especially with the same joy and felici tie , as it did where it was first bred , for the certain agreement of nature that is between the place and the thing Elephant . bred in that place ; as appears by the Elephant , which being translated and brought out of the second or third climate , though they may live , yet will they never engender or bring forth young . Also we see the like in many kinds Orange tree , of plants and herbs ; for example , the Orange trees , although in Naples they bring forth fruit abundantly , in Room and Florence they will bear only fair green leaves , but not any fruit : and translated into England , they will hardly bear either flowers , fruit , or leaves , but are the next Winter pinched and withered with cold : yet it follows not for this , that England , Rome , and Florence should not be habitable . Twa causes of ln the proving of these cold regions habitable , I shall heat - very short , because the same reasons serve for this purpose , which were alleged before in the proving the middle Zone to be temperate , especially seeing all heat and cold proceed from the Sun , by the means either of the Angle which his beams do make with the Horizon , or else by the long or short continuance of the Suns presence above ground : so that if the Suns beams do beatrice perpendicularly at right Angles , then there is one cause of heat , and if the Sun do also long continue above the Horizon , then the heat thereby is much increased by access of this other cause , & so grows to a kind of extremity . And these two causes , as I said before , do most concur under the two Tropicks , and therefore there is the greatest heat of the world . And likewise , where both these causes
