should make more store of small cables and ropes , as cables of 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . inches . For these great cables be not for every man ; and the greatest cables be not best jaded : and likewise small ropes for shrouds , shoal , and other small tackling : and that you look better to the spinning of their yarn 4 Â° 4 that it be even and well tarred . The sables that you do mind to send us let them be principali and fair , and not passed foure or five timbars . For they will not be so commonly worn here as they have been with noble men : and likewise of Luserns send few and principal good . We mind to send you in our ships 100 tons of salt . And because we perceive that ballast is hardly to be had at our lading place there with you , we would you should have in a readiness 100 tons of the white stones whereof you sent us home and example two years past .

And as we wrote unto you in our ships , he is our servant for years : And for that we know him to be honest , true and painefiill , our mind is he shall placed where he may do best service . He does know the commodities and discommodities of all kind of wares which you do send us . Therefore we would you should credit his sayings both in quantity of wares and goodness , as also wherein is most our profit . We see by your letters that your opinion is that the ropemakers should remain there two years more ; and that you have provided great plenty of hemp , which we are content withal . But as yet we have sold none of our cables nor halsers
