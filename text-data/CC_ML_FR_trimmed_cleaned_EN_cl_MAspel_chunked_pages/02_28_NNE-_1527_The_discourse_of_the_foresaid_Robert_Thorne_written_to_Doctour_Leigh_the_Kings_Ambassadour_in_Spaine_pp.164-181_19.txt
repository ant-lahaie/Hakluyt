that into England I may come with your Lordship , I will show some conjectures of reason , though against the generail opinion of Cosmographers , by which shall appear this that I say not to lack some foundation . And till that time I beseech your Lordship let it be put to silence : and in the mean season it may please God to send our two Englishmen , that are gone to the Spicery , which may also bring more plain declaration of that which in this case might be desired . Also I know I needed not to have been so prolix in 180 the declaration of this Card to your Lordship , if the said Card had be very well made after the rules of Cosmography . For your Lordship would soon understand it better then I , or any other that could have made it : and so it should appear that I showed Delphinum natare . But for that I have made it after my rude manner , it is necessary that I be the declarer or glosser of mine own work , or else your Lordship should have had much labour to understand it , which now with it also cannot be excused , it is so grossly done . But I knew you looked for no curious things of me , and therefore I trust your Lordship will accept this , and hold me for excused . In other men ' s letters that they write they crave pardon that at this present they write no larger : but I must finish , asking pardon that at this present I write so largely . Jesus preserve your Lordship with augmentation of dignities . Your servant Robert Thorn , 1527 . Epitaphium M . Roberti Thorni , sepulti in Ecclesia Templariorum Londini . Obertus jacet hic Thorn , quem Bristolia quondam Praetoris merito legit ad officium . Huic etenim semper magna ; Respublica curae , Charior & cunctis patria divitiis . Far inopi auxilium , tristes componere lights , Dulce huic consilio qu6sque juvare fuit . Qui pius exaudis miserorum voto precesque , Christe huic coeli des region locum .
