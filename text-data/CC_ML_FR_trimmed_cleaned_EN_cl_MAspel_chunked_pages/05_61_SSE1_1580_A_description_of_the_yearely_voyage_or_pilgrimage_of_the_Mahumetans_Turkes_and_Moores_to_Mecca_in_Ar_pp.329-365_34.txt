walls & towers to the landward , but through continuance of time almost consumed and wasted : on the side to seaward it stands unwalled . Grida hath three gates , one on eke side , and the thirde in the midst toward the land , which is called , The port of Mecca , near unto which are 6 . or 7 . Turks upon [ II i . 211 . ] the old towers for guard thereof with foure falcons upon one of the corners of the city to the landward . Also to seaward where the wall joineth with the water , there is lately made a fort like unto a bulwark , where they have planted 25 pieces of the best ordinance that might be had , which are very well kept and guarded . More outward towards the sea upon the farthest old tower are other five good pieces with 30 men to guard them . On the other side of the city at the end of the wall there is lately built a bulwark strong and well guarded by a Sanjaccho with 150 Turks well provided with ordinance and all other necessaries and munition , and all these fortifyings are for none other cause then The Portugal ! for fear and suspicion of the Portugals . And if the Port were g °° d all this were in vain : but the port cansea . not be worse nor more dangerous , being all full of rocks and sands , in such wise , that the ships cannot come near , but perforce ride at the least two miles off . At Forty or fifty this port arrive every year forty or fifty great ships rich ships laden with spices and other rich merchandise which yield at Grida . in custom 150000 ducats , the half whereof goes unto the Grand Signior , and the other half to the Serifo . And because there is none other thing worthy mention in Grida we will return to our Carovan which hath almost rested enough . 360 THe Carovan departeth for Medina returning the same way they came unto Bedrihonem abovesaid ,
