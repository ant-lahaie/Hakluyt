as it were ) a hive on their heads , which doth not pass the lower part of his ear , when it is lifted up : they go all bore footed , but the Noble men never go on foot , but are carried by men in a seat with great reputation , with a hat made of the leaves of a tree to keep him from the rain and Sun , or otherwise they ride on horseback with their feet bore in the stirrups . All sorts of women order of whatsoever they be , wear a smock down to the girdle , women ' s and from the girdle downwards to the foot they wear a cloth of three brases , open before ; so strait that they cannot go , but they must show their secret as it were aloft , and in their going they feign to hide it with their hand , but they cannot by reason of the straitness of their cloth . They say that this use was invented by a Queen to be and occasion that the sighed thereof might remove from men the vices against nature , which they are greatly given unto : which sighed should cause them to regard women the more . Also the women go bore footed , their arms laden with hoops of gold and Jewels : And their fingers full of precious rings , with their hair rolled up about their heads , . Many of them wear a cloth about their shoulders in stead of a cloak . Now to finish that which I have begun to write , I say , that those parts of the Indies are very good , because that a man that hath little , shall make a great deal thereof ; always they must govern themselves that they be taken for honest men . For why ? to such there shall never want help to do well , but he that is vicious , let him tarry at home and not go thither , because he shall always be a beggar , and die a poor man .
