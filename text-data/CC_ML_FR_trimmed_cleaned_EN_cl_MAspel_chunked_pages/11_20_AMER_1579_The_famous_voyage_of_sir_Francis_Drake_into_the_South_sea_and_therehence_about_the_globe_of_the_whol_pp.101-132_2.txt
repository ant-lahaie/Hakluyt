, and coasting along the shore , we did descry , not contrary to our expectation , certain Canters which were Spanish fishermen , to whom we gave chase and took three of them , and proceeding further we met with 3 . Caravels and took them also . The 17 . day of January we arrived at Cape Blanco , Januarie . where we found a ship riding at anchor , within the Cape , and but two simple Mariners in her , which ship we took and carried her further into the harbour , where we remained 4 . days , and in that space our General mustered , and trained his men on land in warlike manner , to make them fit for all occasions . In this place we took of the Fishermen such necessaries as we wanted , and they could yield us , and leaving here one of our little barks called the Benedict , we took with us one of theirs which they called Canters , being of the burden of 40 . tons or thereabouts . All these things being finished , we departed this harbour the 22 . of Januarie , carrying along with us one of the Portugall Caravels which was bound to the Islands of Cape Verde for salt , whereof good store is made in one of those Islands . The master or Pilot of that Caravel did advertise our general that upon one of those Islands called Mayo , The Isle of there was great store of dried Cabritos , which a few MaJ Â°- inhabitants there dwelling did yearly make ready for such of the kings Ships as did there touch , being bound for his country of Brasile or elsewhere . we fell with this Island the 27 . of January , but the Inhabitants would in no case traffic with us , being 103 thereof forbidden by the kings Edict : yet the next day our general sent to view the Island , and the likelihoods that might be there of provision of victuals , about threescore and two men under the conduct and government of Master Winter and Master Doughty , and
