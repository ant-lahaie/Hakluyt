all security , he might in Winter time ( vacare ) be at convenient leisure on land , chiefly to set forth Gods due honour , and secondly to understand , and diligently to listen to the causes and complaints of his commons . For as Matthaeus Westmonasteriensis of him to his Imperiali commendation hath left us a remembrance . Habebat autem praeterea consuetudinem , per omnes Regni provincias transire , ut intelligeret quomodo legum jura , & suorum statuta decretorum , i principibus observarentur , & ne pauperes a potentibus praejudicium passi , opprimerentur , diligenter investigare solebat : in uno fortitudini , in altero Justitiae studens , & Reipub . regnique utilitati consulens in utroque . Hinc hostibus circumquaque timor , & amor omnium erga eum excreverat subditorum .

This was in deed ( as before is recorded ) a kingly providence , Reipub . Regmque utilitati consulens , etc . beside with great utility and profit public foreseen , and by his means enjoyed , he himself used most gladly the advantage of that security , in ministering of justice , or causing the same to be executed all his kingdom over , not squemishly , frowningly or skornefully shunning the ragged and tattered sleeve of any suppliant , holding up to him a simple soiled bill of complaint or petition , and that homely contrived , or afraid at , and timorously hasting from the sickly pale face or feeble limmed suitor , extremely constrained so to speak for himself , nor parcially smothering his own conscience ,
