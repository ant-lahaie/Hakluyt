in Newfound land alone , but in Germany , Italy and Afrike , even under the Equinoctial line , the mountains are extreme cold , and seldom uncovered of snow , in their culme and highest tops , which comes to pass by the same reason that they are extended towards the middle region : yet in the countries lying beneath them , it is found quite contrary . Even so all hills having their descents , the valleis also and low grounds must be likewise hight or temperate , as the climb doth Cold by aai - give in Newfound land : though I am of opinion that the dental means . guns reflection is much cooled , and cannot be so forcible in the Newfound land , nor generally throughout America , as in Europe or Afrike : by how much the Sun in his diurnal course from East to West , passes over ( for the most part ) dry land and sandy countries , before he arriveth at the West of Europe or Afrike , whereby his motion increases heat , with little or no qualification by moist vapours . Where , on the contrary fie passes from Europe and Afrike unto America over the Ocean , from whence it draws and carrieth with him abundance of moist vapours , which do qualify and enfeeble greatly the Suns reverberation upon this country chiefly of Newfound land , being so much to the Northward . Nevertheless ( as I said before ) the cold cannot be so intolerable under the latitude of 46 47 and 48 ( especial within land ) that it should be unhabitable , as some do suppose , seeing also there are very many people more to the North by a great deal . And in these South parts there be certain beasts , Ounces or Leopards , and birds in like manner which in the Summer we have seen , not herd of in countries of extreme and vehement coldness . Beside , as in the months of June , July , August and September , the heat is somewhat more then in England at those seasons : so men remaining upon the South parts near unto Cape Rece , until after Hollandtide , have not found the cold so extreme , nor much differing
