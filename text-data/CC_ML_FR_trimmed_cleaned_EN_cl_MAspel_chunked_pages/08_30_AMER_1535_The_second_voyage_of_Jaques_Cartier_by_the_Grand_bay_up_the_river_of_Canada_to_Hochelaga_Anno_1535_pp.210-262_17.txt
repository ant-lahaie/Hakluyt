but mischief and treason , as well by this deed as others that we by him had seen . After that our Captain caused the said children to be put in our ships , and caused two Swords and two copper Basons , the one wrought , the other plain , to be brought unto him , and them he gave to Donnacona , who was therewith greatly contented , yielding most hearty thanks unto our Captain for them , and presently upon that he commanded all his people to sing and dance , and desired our Captain to cause a piece of artillery to be shot off , because Taignoagny and Domagaia made great brags of it , and had told them marvellous things , and also , because they had never herd nor seen 224 . any before : to whom our Captain answered , that he was content : and by and by he commanded his men to shoot off twelve cannons charged with bullets into the wood that was hard by those people and ships , at whose noise they were greatly astonished and amazed , for they thought that heaven had fallen upon them , and put themselves to flight , howling , crying , and shrieking , so that it seemed hell was broken lose . But before we went thence , Taignoagny caused other men to tell us , that those men which we had left in our Pinnace in the road , had slain two men of their company , with a piece of ordinance that they had shot ofF , whereupon the rest had put themselves all to flight , as though they should all have be slain : which afterwards we found untrue , because our men had not shot off any piece at all that day . How Donnacona and Taignoagny with others , devised a pretty sleight or policy : for they caused three of their men to be attired like Devils , feigning themselves to be sent from their God Cudruaigny , only to hinder our voyage to Hochelaga .
