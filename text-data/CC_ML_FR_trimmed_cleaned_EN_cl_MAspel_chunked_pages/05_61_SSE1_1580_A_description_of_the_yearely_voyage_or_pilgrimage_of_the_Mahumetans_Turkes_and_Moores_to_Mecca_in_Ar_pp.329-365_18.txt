, and the chest during their voyage is covered with Silk , but at their entering into Mecca it is all covered with cloth of gold , adorned with jewels , and 345 ' the like at the entrance into Medina . The Carnell aforesaid which carrieth the chest , is compassed about with many Arabian singers and musicians , always singing and playing upon instruments . After this follow fifteene other most fair Camels , every one carrying one of the abovesaid vestures , being covered from top to toe with silk . Behind these go twentie other Camels which carry the money , apparel , and provision of the Amir el Cheggi captain of the Carovan . After followeth the royal Standard of the grand Signior , accompanied continually with the musicians of the captain , and five and twentie Spachi archers , with a Chaus before them , and about these marvelous things go all the people and Camels which follow the Carovan . Behind these , less then a mile , followeth the rearward , whereof the greater part are pilgrimss : the occasion whereof is , for that the merchant ' s seek always to be in the forward for the security of their goods , but the pilgrimss which have little to lose care not though they come behind . Behind these always go five and twentie other Spachi well armed with another Chaus their captain , and fortie Arabians all Archers for guard of the rearward . And because the Carovan goes always along the read sea bank , which in going forth they have on their right hand , therefore the two hundred Janissaries parted into three companies go upon their left hand well armed and mounted upon Camels bound one to another , for upon that side is all the danger of thieves , and on the other no danger at all , the captain of the Carovan always going about his people , sometime on the one side , and sometime on the other , never keeping any firm place , being continually accompanied with a Chaus and 25 . Spachi , armed and mounted upon Dromedaries
