vn 33 c the people wondrous favourable to us , who being but Moors and heathen people showed us where to have fresh water and all other necessaries for us . And there we had such good entertainment , as if we had be in any place of England . The governor was one that favoured us greatly , whom we in respect of his great friendship presented with gifts and such commodities as we had in our custody , which he wonderfully well accepted of : and here we stayed foure days . After the battle was ceased , which was on Easter Tuesday , we stayed for want of wind before Gibraltar , until the next morning , where we were becalmed , and [ II ii . 168 . ] therefore looked every hour when they would have sent forth some fresh supply against us , but they were far unable to do it , for all their Galleys were so soar battered , that they durst not come forth of the harbour , by reason of our hight resistance which they so lately before had received . Yet were they greatly urged thereunto by the Governor of the said Town of Gibraltar . At our being at Tition in Barbary , there we herd report of the hurt that we had done to the Galleys , for at our coming from them we could not well discern any thing at all by reason of the smoke which the powder had made : there we herd that we had almost spoiled those twelve Galleys by shooting them clean through , that two of them were ready to sink , and that we had slain of their men such great abundance , as that they were not able to furnish forth any more Galleys at all for that year . Thus after we came from Tition , we assayed to depart the Straight three several times , but could not pass , yet , God be thanked , the fourth time we came safely away , and so sailed with a pleasant wind until we came upon the coast of England , which was in the beginning of the month of July 1590 .
