I558 - costly furs , with a crown upon his head , of the Tartarian fashion , went to the Church in procession , with the Metropolitan , and diverse bishops and priests . That day I was before the Emperor again in Russe apparel , and the Emperor asked if that were not I , and his Chancellor answered yea . Then he bade me to dinner : then came he out of the church , and went with the procession upon the river , being all frozen , and there standing bore headed , with all his Nobles , there was a hold made in the ice , and the Metropolitan hallowed the water with great solemnity and service , and did cast of the said water upon the Emperor ' s son and the Nobility . That done , the people with great thronging filled pots of the said water to carry home to their houses , and diverse children were thrown in , and sick people , and plucked out quickly again , and diverse Tartars christened : all which the Emperor beheld . Also there were brought the Emperors best horses , to drink at the said hallowed water . All this being ended , he returned to his palace again , and went to dinner by candle light , and sat in a wooden house , very fairly gilded . There dined in the place , above 300 strangers , and I sat alone as I did before , directly before the Emperor , and had my meat , bred and drink sent me from the Emperor .
