none should escape , had with them a cruel fight . Then the earl began to repent him of his heady rashness , but it was too late , who then seeing William the English knight doughtily fighting in the chief brunt The cowardly of the enemies , cried unto him most cowardly to fly , fi ^^ Eark seeing God ( says he ) does fight against us : To whom a ert ' the Knight answering again , God forbid ( say he ) that my father ' s son should run away from the face of a Saracen . The Earl then turning his horse , fled away , thinking to avoid by the swiftness of his horse , and so taking the river Thafnis , oppressed with harness , was there sunken and drowned . Thus the Earl being gone , the Frenchmen began to despair and scatter . Then William de Longespe bearing all the force of the enemies , stood against them as long as he could , wounding and slaying many a Saracen , till at length his horse being killed , and his legs The valiant maimed , he could no longer stand , who yet notwith - ende of Will - stanj ; ng . as he was Jowne mangled their feet and legs , and did the Saracens much sorrow , till at last after many blows and wounds , being stoned of the Saracens , he yielded his life . And after the death of him , the Saracens setting upon the residue of the army , whom they had compassed on every side , devoured and destroyed them all , insomuch that scarce one man remained alive , saving two Templaries , one Hospitaler , and one poor rascal soldier , which brought tidings , hereof to the King . And thus by the imprudent and foolish hardiness of that French Earl , the Frenchmen were discomfited , and that valiant English Knight overmatched , to the grief of all Christian people , the glory of the Saracens , and the utter destruction and ruin of the whole French army , as afterwards it appeared .
