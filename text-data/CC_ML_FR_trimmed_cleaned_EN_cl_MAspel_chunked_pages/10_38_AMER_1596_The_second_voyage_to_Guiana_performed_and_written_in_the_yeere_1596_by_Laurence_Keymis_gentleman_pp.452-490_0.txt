The second voyage to Guiana . Unday the 26 . of January , in the year of our Lord 1596 . we departed from Portland road , in the Darling of London , having in company the Discoverer , a small pinnace , whom we lost at sea , in foul weather , the Thursday next following . Friday , the 13 . of February , we fell with the Canarie Islands , where we expected our pinnace , according to our appointment , seven or eight days . Here we took two boats , the one a passenger , we bulged , the other we towed at our ship stern , steering Southsouthwest for the Islands of Cape Verde . Therehence we set sail the 28 . of Februarie , keeping a Westsouthwest 452 course . In this passage we found very smooth seas , fair weather , and steady winds , blowing ordinarily between the East and Northeast points . Near 30 . leagues from these Islands , we came into a grown sea , the swollen waters making a strange noise & hurtling together , as if it might be two strong currents encountering each other . The 12 . of March we sounded , and had sandy ground in 47 . fathom . At midnight in twelve fathom we came to and anchor , the ground sandy oaze . Sunday the 14 . towards night , about some sixe leagues from the shore , we descried a low land in the bottom of a bay . From the 9 . of March until this time , we kept for the most part a Southsouthwest course . The water in this place is smooth , but muddy , and the colour read or tawny . From the Westermost of the Cape Verde - Islands unto this Bay I do estimate the distance to be near 550 . leagues . It seemed to most of our seamen , to be the very bank of a shoaled upon a lee - shore : the rather because without it , in the clean green sea we had but 7 . fathom depth :
