Whereto the other Priests and Deacons that stand somewhat far of by the altar or table , answer singing : Many years , many years to the noble Theodore . The same note is taken up by the Priests and Deacons , that are placed at the right and left side of the Church , and then altogether , they chant and thunder out , singing : Many years to the noble Theodore , good , honourable , beloved of God , great Duke of Volodomer , Mosco , Emperor of 375 all Russia , etc . These solemnities being ended , first comes the Patriarch with the Metropolites , Archbishop ' s , and Bishops , then the Nobility , and the whole company in their order , to do homage to the Emperor , bending down their heads , and knocking them at his feet to the very ground .
