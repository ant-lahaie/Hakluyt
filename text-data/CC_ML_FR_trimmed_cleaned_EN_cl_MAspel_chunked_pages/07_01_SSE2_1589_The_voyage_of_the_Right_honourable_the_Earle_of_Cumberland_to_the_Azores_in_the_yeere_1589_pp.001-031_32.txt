that Captain Lister and all the men in the ship were drowned , save 5 . or 6 . the one half English , the other Spanish that saved themselves with swimming : but notwithstanding much of the goods were saved , and reserved for us , by sir Francis Godolphin , and the worshipful gentlemen of the Country there . My Lord was very sorry for Captain Listers death , wishing that he had lost his voyage to have saved his life . The 29 . of December we met with another ship , that told us the same news , and that sir Martin Frobisher , & Captain Reymond had taken the Admiral and vice - Admirall of the Fleet that we espied going to Tercera haven . But the Admiral was sunk with much leaking , near to the Idy Stone , a rock that lies over against Plimouth found , and the men were saved . This ship also certified us that Captain Prestons ship had taken a prize laden with silver . My Lord entered presently into this ship , & went to Falmouth , and we held on our course for Plimouth . At night we came near to the Ramehead ( the next Cape Westwards from Plimouth found ) but we were afraid to double it in the night , misdoubting the scantness of the wind . So we stood off to Sea half the night , and towards morning had the wind more large , and made too little spare thereof , that partly for this cause , and partly through mistaking of the land , we were driven so much to leewards , that we could not double that Cape : Therefore 3 Â° we returned back again , and came into Falmouth haven , where we struck on ground in 17 . foot water : but it was a low ebb , and ready again to flow , and the ground soft , so as no hurt was done . Here with gladness we set foot again upon the English ground ( long desired ) and refreshed our selves with keeping part of Christmas upon our native soil .
