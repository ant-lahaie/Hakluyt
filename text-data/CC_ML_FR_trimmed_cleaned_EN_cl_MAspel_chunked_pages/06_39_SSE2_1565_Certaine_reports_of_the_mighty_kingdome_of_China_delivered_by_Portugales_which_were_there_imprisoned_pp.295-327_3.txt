have thought to have found any one at all . From these places in number infinite , you shall come unto two Cities very populous , and , being compared with Cinceo , not possibly to be discerned which is the greater 297 of them . These cities are as well walled as any Cities in all the world . As you come in to either of them , there stands so great and mighty a bridge , that the like thereof I have never seen in Portugal nor else where . I herd one of my fellows say , that he told in one bridge 40 . arches . The occasion wherefore these bridges are made so great is , for that the Country is towards the sea very plain and low , and overflowed ever as the sea water increases . The breadth of the bridges , although it be well proportioned unto the length thereof , yet are they equally built , no higher in the middle then at either end , in such wise that you may see directly from the one end to the other : the sides are wonderfully well engraved after the manner of Rome - workes . But that we did most marveile at was therewithal ! the hugeness of the stones , the like whereof , as we came in to the City , we did . see many set up in places dis - habited by the way , to no small charges of theirs , howbeit to little purpose , whereas no body sees them but such as do come by . The arches are not made after our fashion , vaunted with sundry stones set together : but paved , as it were , whole stones reaching from one pillar to and other , in such wise that they lie both for the arches heads , and gallantly serve also for the high way . I have be astonished to behold the hugeness of the aforesaid stones : some of them are xii . pases long and upward , the least 11 . good pases long , and and half . The ways echwhere are gallantly paved
