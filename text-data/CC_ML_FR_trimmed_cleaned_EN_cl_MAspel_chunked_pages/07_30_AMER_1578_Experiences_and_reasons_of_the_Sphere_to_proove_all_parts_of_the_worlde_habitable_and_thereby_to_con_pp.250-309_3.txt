latitude , I am to prove by experience and reason , that all that distance included between these two Parallels last nam ( containing 40 . degrees in latitude , going round about the earth , according to longitude ) is not only habitable , but the same most fruitful and delectable , and that if any extremity of heat be , the same not to be within the space of twenty degrees of the Equinoctial on either side , but only under and about the two Tropickes , and so proportionally the nearer you do approach to either Tropicke , the more you are subject to extremity of heat ( if any such be ) and so Marochus being situate but sixe or seven degrees from the Tropicke of Cancer , shall be more subject to heat , then any place under or near the Equinoctial line .
