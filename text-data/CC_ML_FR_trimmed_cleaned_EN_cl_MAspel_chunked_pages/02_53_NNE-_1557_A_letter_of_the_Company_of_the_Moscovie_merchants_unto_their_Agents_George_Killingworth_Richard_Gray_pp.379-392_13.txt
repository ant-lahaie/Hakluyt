low water , and is as near Colmogro as S . Nicholas : which will be a great pleasure unto us . We will that Steven Burrowe do proceed on his voyage to discover . Also we have sent you one Anthonie Jenkinson Gentleman , a man well traveled , whom we mind to use in further traveling , according to a Commission delivered him , subscribed by master Anthonie Huse and others . Wherefore we will you deliver him one or more of such painful young men as he shall think meetest for his purpose : and likewise such money and wares as he shall think best to take with him . He must have fourty pounds a year for foure years , to be paid him by the half year , or as he will demand it of you , so let him have it from Easter last . Also the princes of wares here at this present are , bale flax twenty pound the pack and better , tow flax twentie eight pound the hundred , train oil at nine pound the tun , wax at foure pound the hundred , tallow at sixteene shillings the hundred , cables and ropes very deer : as yet there are no ships come out of Dansk . Kept until the tenth day of this present . As this day came the goods out of Scotland that were recovered out of the Edward Bonaventure : and now we do perceive that the cask that the train oil came in , is very good , and much better then ours . Therefore our 390 mind is , that you shall lade it all in such barrels of the bigger sort as you jaded in the Edward , and no long barrels nor small . And that cask that we have sent may serve for the Tallow or any other ware that is not leakage . Nevertheless , this voyage you must take such as you can get . Also if the Emperor be minded to deliver you any sum of money , or good Wax at as reasonable a price as you may buy for ready money , we will that you shall take it and
