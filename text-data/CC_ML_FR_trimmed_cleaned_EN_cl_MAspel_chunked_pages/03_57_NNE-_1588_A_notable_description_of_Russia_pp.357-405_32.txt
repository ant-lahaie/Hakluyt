: as is easily understood by those that know the manner of the Russe building . In this Castle stands their shot well fenced for advantage , specially against the Tartar , that brings no ordinance , nor other weapon into the field with him , save his sword , and bow , and arrows . They have also within it diverse field pieces , which they use as occasion does require . Of pieces for the field they carry no great store , when they war against the Tartar : but when they deal with the Polonian ( of whose forces they make more account ) they go better furnished with all kind of munition , and other necessary provisions . It is thought that no Prince of Christendome hath better store of munition , then the Russe Emperor . And it may partly appear by the Artillery house at Mosco , where are of all sorts of great Ordinance , all brass pieces , very fair , to and exceeding great number . The Russe soldier is thought to be better at his defence within some castle or town , then he is abroad at a set pitched field . Which is ever noted in the practice of his wars , and namely at the siege of Vobsco , about eight years since : where he repulsed the Polonian king Stepan Batore , with his whole army of iooooo men , and forced him in the end to give over his siege , with the loss of many of his best Captains and soldiers . But in a set field the Russe is noted to have ever the worse of the Polonian and Sweden . If any behave himself more valiantly then the rest , in 385 2 B 1580 . Reward for valour . or do any special piece of service , the Emperor sends him a piece of gold , stamped with the Image of Saint George on horseback . Which they hang on their sleeves , & set in their caps . And this is accounted the greatest honour they can receive , for any service they do . Of
