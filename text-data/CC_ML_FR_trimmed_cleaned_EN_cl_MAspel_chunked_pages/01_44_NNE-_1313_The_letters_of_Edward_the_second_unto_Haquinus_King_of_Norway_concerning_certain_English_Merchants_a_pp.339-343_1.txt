driven perforce , and constrained thereunto ) should lay in sufficient security for the payment of fortie pounds sterling , upon a certain day appointed , unto your use , for every of the foresaid ships : and also until they had moreover delivered three pledges , for the bringing of the said ships and men back again into the foresaid haven , before the feast of the nativity of S . John the Baptist next ensuing , then and there to stand unto your favour and courtesy , as touching the said persons , and those ships of theirs : which dealing , the parties themselves take very grievously , yea , and all others that hear thereof think it to be a strange and unwonted course . And because it is most undoubtedly contrary to all reason , equity , justice , and law , that the faults or demerits of offenders should in any sort be punished in such persons , or in their goods , as neither have be accessory nor partakers in the crime , nor have had any society with the said offenders : we do heartily entreat and request your Highness , that weighing and pondering the matter in the balance of justice , you would of your love and friendship , command the foresaid pledges to be set at liberty , and the said security utterly to be released and acquitted . And know you this for a certainty , that if the foresaid malefactors , who ( as it is reported ) slew your Knight aforesaid , shall any where within our realm and dominions be found , we will cause justice and judgement to be executed upon them , according to the Law and custom of our say de Realm . For we cannot in these times conveniently and well endure , that the ships aforesaid , or any other ships of our kingdom ( which ought always to be in a readiness for our service ) should without speciali licence , depart out of our said kingdom , unto foreign dominions . Now , what you shall think good at this our request to perform in the premises , 342 may it please you by the bearer of these presents to return and answer unto us . Given at Windsore the 16 . of April .
