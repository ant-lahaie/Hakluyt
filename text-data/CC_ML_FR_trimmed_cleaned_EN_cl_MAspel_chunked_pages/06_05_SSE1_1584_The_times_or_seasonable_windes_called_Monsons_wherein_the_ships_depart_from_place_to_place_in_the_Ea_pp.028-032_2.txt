, they have Westerly winds , and so come for Chaul and Goa , and if the said ships depart not before the 25 of April , they are not then to depart that monson , but to winter in Ormus because of the winter . The first monson from Ormus for Zindi . The ships depart for Ormus betwixt the 15 and 20 of Aprill . The second monson from Ormus for Zindi . The ships depart betwixt the 10 and 20 of October for Zindi from Ormus . The monson from Ormus for the read sea . The ships depart from Ormus betwixt the first and last of Januarie . Hitherto I have noted the monsons of the ships departing from Goa to the Northward : Now follow the monsons wherein the ships depart from Goa to the Southward . The monson from Goa for Calicut , Cochin , Seilan , and all that coast . THe ships depart from those places betwixt the 1 and 15 of August , and there they find it navigable all the year except in the winter , which continueth as is aforesaid , from the 15 of May till the 10 of August . In like manner the ships come from these places for Goa at every time in the year except in the winter , but of all other the best time is to come in November , December and January . The first monson from Goa , for Pegu . The ships depart from Goa , betwixt the 15 and 20 of April , and winter at S . Thomas , and after the 5 of August , they depart from S . Thomas for Pegu . The second monson from Goa for Pegu . The ships depart from Goa betwixt the 8 and 24 of August , going straight for Pegu , and if they pass the 24 of August , they cannot pass that monson , neither is there any more monsons till April as is aforesaid . Note that the chiefest trade is , to take money of S . Thomas rials , and patechoni , and to go to S . Thomas , and there to buy Tellami , which is fine cloth of India , whereof there is great quantity made in Coromandel , and brought thither , and other merchandise are not good for that place except some dozen of very fair Emeralds orientali .
