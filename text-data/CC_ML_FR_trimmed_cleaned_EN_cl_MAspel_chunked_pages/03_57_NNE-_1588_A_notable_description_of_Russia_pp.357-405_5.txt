meadows so green and well grown , ( and that upon the sudden ) such variety of flowers , such noise of birds ( specially of Nightingales , that seem to be more loud and of a more 361 variable note then in other Countries ' ) that a man shall not lightly travel in a more pleasant Country . And this fresh and speedy growth of the Spring there seems to proceed from the benefit of the snow : which all the Winter time being spread over the whole Country as a white robe , and keeping it warm from the rigour of the frost , in the Spring time ( when the Sun waxes warm , and dissolveth it into water ) doth so thoroughly drench and soak the ground , that is somewhat of a sleight and sandy mould , and then shines so hotly upon it again , that it draws the herbs and plants forth in great plenty and variety , in a very short time . As the Winter exceeds in cold , so the Summer inclineth to over much heat , specially in the months of June , July and August , being much warmer then the Summer air in England . The Country throughout is very well watered with springs , rivers , and Ozera ' s , or lake ' s . Wherein the providence of God is to be noted , for that much of the Country being so far inland , as that some part lies a thousand miles and more every way from any Sea , yet it is served with fair Rivers , and that in very great number , that emptying themselves one into another , , run all into the Sea . Their lake ' s are many and large , , some of 60 . 80 . 100 . and 200 . miles long , with breadth proportionate . The chief Rivers are these , First , Volgha , that hath his head or spring at the root of and Aldertree , about 200 . versed above Yaruslave , and grows so big by the increase of other Rivers
