, or fights in the seas ; the Pilot directeth only in government and leading the ship to her port . All the Captains , Master ' s , Pilots , Mariners , and passengers , and all others be obedient to the two ships , so appointed to pass : they do , as in all other commandments what is by them appointed , having power to hang , or do any justice upon any man , as to them seems good at sea , and this is the last commandment upon pain of death , if the General please . Concerning the Contractation house , there are therein Sixe Judges , sixe Judges of the highest sort . Foure visi - There are visitors of ships , as it is said before , to see whither the ships go in order well , and sufficient in the art of things : and what manner of men the Master ' s of the Navigation , ships and Pilots are , whither they be able to answer to all such articles , as the reader is able to object unto them , in matters of Navigation : if they be not found sufficient , they are not admitted to take charge . The master must know whither the ship be sufficiently calked , tackled , and furnished in all things accordingly , as with masts , sails , cables , anchors , and all other necessary furniture : that at such time as any of the high judges with their ordinary visitors appointed for such causes do come , there be nothing found out of order or lacking , rders ^ alud accorchng to The book of order , which every ship Â° in Spanish proportionable to her burden ought to have , which is not Pragmatics , unknown to any of the master ' s , being in writing common common in among them : and all the charge given to the Master and writing among pnot serves only to conduct the ship from port to port . The counter Master , or master ' s mate is obedient in all things whereunto he shall be commanded by the master 446 and Pilot , and at his commandment are all the mariners of the ship . The ships commonly go deeper laden from Spaine , then our ships do in any voyage .
