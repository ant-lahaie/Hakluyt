any manner whatsoever : but rather if any thing be done unto them contrary and to the prejudice of these presents , they shall remove and cause the same to be removed , and that which shall be * 57 hindered they shall set at free deliverance , upon pain to fallen into and to incur our high displeasure . For such is our pleasure and so will we have it , notwithstanding any letters falsely crept in , obtained , or to be obtained contrary hereunto . And you our subject ' s , the common merchants and mariners , so behave your selves , that you may receive commendation of us for your good obedience , knowing that such as shall be found doing or to have done the contrary , we will see them so punished without redemption , that they shall be and example to all rebellious persons . We pray and most instantly require in the aid of equity , all others our friends , allies , and well - willers , aswell princes and potentates , as their justicers , officers , lieutenants , deputies , commissaries , and subject ' s , and every of them , in regard of equity ; that they would vouchsafe , and that it would please them to give , do , and lend comfort , aid , assistance , and prisons if need require , to our said governor , his lieutenants , commissaries , deputies , justicers , & others our officers and ministers aforesaid : and herein we pray them on our behalf , and in our own name . And it may please them herein to do so much , that we may have occasion to thank them , and to account our selves beholding for the same : and as they would that we should do for them in the like matter , or in a greater : which we will willingly do , if we be required thereunto by them . In witness whereof we have caused these our letters to be made patents . Witness our selves at Westminster , the sixteenth of April , in the second year our reign .
