Eastwards , to the countries or dominions of the mighty Prince , the Emperor of Cathay , and in the same unto the Cities of Cambalu and Quinsay , or to either of them . The which passage ( upon authority of writers , and great reason ) is conceived to be from the Vaigats Eastwards , according to the description in plate of spirali lines , made by master William Burrough , whereof either of the said Arthur Pet , and Charles Jackman , have one delivered unto them , and also one other sailing card , and a blank plate for either of them . But if it should not be in all points , according to that description , yet we hope that the continent or firm land of Asia does not stretch it self so far Northwards , but that there may be found a sea passable by it , between the latitude of 70 . and 80 . degrees . And therefore we have appointed you with these two barks to make trial of the same : wishing you both to join in friendship together , as most deer friends and brother ' s , to all purposes and effects , to the furtherance and orderly 252 performing of the same voyage . And likewise order your companies , that they of the one bark may have such love and care , to help and succour them of the other , as most deer friends and brother ' s would do : so as it may appear , that though they be two barks , and two companies , ( which is so appointed for your greater comfort and assurance ) yet that you are wholly of one mind , and bend your selves to the uttermost of your powers , to perform the thing that you are both employed for . Do you observe good order in your daily service , and pray unto God , so shall you prosper the better . We would have you to meet often together , to talk , confer , consult , and agree how , and by what means you may best perform this purposed voyage , according to our intents .
