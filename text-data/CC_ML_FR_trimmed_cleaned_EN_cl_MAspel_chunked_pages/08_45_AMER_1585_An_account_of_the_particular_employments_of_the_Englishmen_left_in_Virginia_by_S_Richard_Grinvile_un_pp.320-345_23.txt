He sent me word that he would himself come over to Roanoak , but from day to day he deferred , only to bring the Weopomeioks with him & the Mandoags , whose time appointed was within eight days after . It was the last of May 1586 when all his own Savages began to make their assembly at Roanoak , at his commandment sent abroad unto them , and I resolved not to stay longer upon his coming over , since he meant to come with so good company , but thought good to go and visit him with such as I had , which I resolved to do the next day : but that night I meant by the way to give them in the Island a canvisado , and at the instant to seize upon all the canoas about the Island , to keep him from advertisements . But the town took the alarm before I meant it to 340 them : the occasion was this .

He met with a Canoa going from the shore , and overthrew the Canoa , and cut off slaughter two Savages heads : this was not done so secretly but he was discovered from the shore ; whereupon the cry arose : for in truth they , privy to their own villainous purposes against us , held as good espial upon us , both day and night , as we did upon them . The alarm given , they took themselves to their bows , and we to our arms : some three or foure of them at the first were slain with our shot : the rest fled into the woods . The next morning with the light horseman & one Canoa taking 25 with the Colonel of the Chesepians , and the Sergeant major , I went to Dasamonquepeio
