Blarve . Lituania , & all the dominions of Russia : and the â€™ ' markets , fairs , commodities , great towns & rivers , were sent unto by diverse servants : the reports were taken by Henry Lane , Agent , and delivered to the company , 1561 . The trade to Rye , and Revel , of old time hath be long since frequented by our English nation , but this trade to the Narve was hitherto concealed from us by the Danskers and Lubeckers . Anno 1561 . the said Master Anthony Jenkinson went Agent into Russia , who the next year after , passing all the river of Volga to Astracan , and over the Caspian sea , arrived in Persia , and opened the trade thither . Also between the years of 1568 . and 1573 . sundry voyages after Master Jenkinsons , were made by Thomas Alcock , Arthur Edwards , Master Thomas Bannister , and Master Geffrey Ducket , whose return ( if spoil near Volga had not prevented by roving thieves ) had altogether salved and recovered the companies ( called the old companies ) great loss , charges , and damages : but the saying is true , By unity small things grow great , & by contention great things become small . This may be understood best by the company . The frowardness of some few , and evil doing of some unjust factors , was cause of much of the evil success . Arthur Edwards was sent again 1579 . and died in the voyage at Astracan . About which matters , are to be 335 Alcock slain in Persia . Bannister died in Media . Edwards died at Astracan . remembered the voyages of Master Thomas Randolph Esquire , Ambassador , anno 1567 . And late of Sir Jerome Bows , anno 1583 . both tending and treating for further discoveries , freedoms , and privileges , wherewith I meddle not . But in conclusion , for their pains and adventures this way ( as diverse do now adays other ways ) as worthy Gentlemen sent from princes , to do their country good , I put them in your memory , with my hearty farewell . From S . Magarets near Dartforth in Kent . TO Yours Henry . Lane .
