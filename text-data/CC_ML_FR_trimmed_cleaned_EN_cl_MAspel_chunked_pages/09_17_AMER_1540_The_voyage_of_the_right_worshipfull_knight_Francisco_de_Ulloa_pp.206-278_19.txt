, which ceased , after they had seen a light on their shrowds . AT our coming out of these openings we began to great find a Bay with a very great haven , environed with havendivers small hills having upon them green woods and pleasant to behold . In this bay and strand were two small Islands near unto the shore , one of the which was like unto a table about half a league in bigness , and the other was a round hill almost as big as the former . These Islands served us only to content our sighed , for we passed by them without staying , having but a slack wind on Munday morning : all which day we followed our course with the foresaid slack wind , and within a while after it became flat contrary , so that we were constrained to anchor at the said point of the said haven ; and on Tewesday at break of day we set sail , but made but little away all the day , because 223 the wind continued contrary , although but very weak . The night following we were becalmed a little beyond the point of this haven ; but about midnight we began to have a fresh gale , and on Wednesday in the morning we were seven leagues distant from that point . This country showed ( as it was indeed ) more plain then the rest , with certain small woody hills , and within the other point which was before descried , the situation seemed to be more pleasant and delightsome then the rest which we had passed . And at the uttermost end of the point were two small Islets . The said Wednesday about nine of the clock the wind blew a good gale , and we sailed by evening between seven and eight leagues , and came over against a land not very high , where we saw certain creeks or breaches not very ragged , into every of which a river seemed to fallen , because the soil was very green , and had certain trees growing on it
