safely protecting them ( if need shall require ) under the shadow of your defence : even as you would have us to deal in the like case with your own subject ' s . Moreover , whatsoever you shall think good to put in practice in this behalf , may it please you of your friendship , by our faithful subject John brown the bearer hereof to give us to understand . In the son of the glorious virgin fare you well , with continual prosperity and felicity according to your own hearts desire . Given under our privy seal , at our palace of Westminster , the fift day of June , and in the fift year of our reign . Postscriptum . Right reverend and our most deer friend : albeit our well - beloved Arnold de Dassele the procurator of your foresaid messengers , being desirous at this time to make his final return unto your parts , by reason of the afiayres , for which he hath remained in our realm of England , cannot as yet obtain his wished expedition : notwithstanding you of your sincere affection ought not to marvel or any whit to be grieved thereat : because troubles of wars arising , which in some sort concerned our selves , and especially in regard of the continual assaults of the French men & Britons against us and our kingdom , for the offence of whom , and our own defence , our liege subject ' s ( especially they , of whom your subject ' s damnified have made their complaints ) have armed themselves to combat upon the sea : we could not grant unto the foresaid Arnold such and so speedy and expedition , as he earnestly desired to have . Unto the which Arnold your procurator we have offered in as short time as may be , to administer complete justice with favour , to you end that for this cause he might dispose himself to remain in our realm of England : & yet notwithstanding we would do the very same even in the absence of the said procurator . Given as above . 43
