ingenuously , freely , and willingly confess , and witness : And as for all others who invent any other name in heaven given unto men by which they may be saved , we do earnestly detest , curse , and condemn them ( Acts . 4 . 12 . ) We hold his most holy Word to be the only rule of our salvation : And that alone ( all men devises being cast away and contemned ) we propound unto our selves as and infallible rule , and level of our faith ( Galat . 1 . 8 . Esai 29 . 13 . Ezech . 20 . ) which we contain under the name of the old and new Testament ( Hebr . 8 . ) delivered by the Prophets and Apostles ( Ephe . 2 . 20 . ) by the singular and infinite goodness of God , preserved ever unto this day and to be preserved hereafter always in the Church ( Matth . 28 . last verse . Psal . 71 . 18 . 1 . Cor . 11 . 26 . ) Therefore we render thanks unto our most gracious and Almighty God from our soul , and from our whole heart , because that even unto us being separated and huge distance from the rest of the body of his Church , and inhabiting the farthest parts of the world , he would that this light granted for the revelation of the Gentiles , and prepared before the face of all people , and in old time favourably showed to holy Simeon ( for in Christ are all the treasures of wisdom hidden ) which now doth 148 enlighten and cherish with the saving beams thereof our whole nation , that he would ( I say ) this light should come unto us . This in brief ( running over the very sum ) is our faith , and our Religion , which by the direction of the holy Spirit , and of his Ministers in the vineyard of Christ , we have drawn and that out of the fountains of Israel .
