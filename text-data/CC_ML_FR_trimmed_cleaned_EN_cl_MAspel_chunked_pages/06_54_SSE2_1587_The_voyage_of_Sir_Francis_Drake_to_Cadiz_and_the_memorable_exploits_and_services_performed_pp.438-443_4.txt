sending him word , that he was not then ready for him , nor had any such Commission from his King . Our general thus refused by the Marks , and seeing no more good to be done in this place , thought it convenient to spend no longer time upon this coast : and therefore with consent of the chief of his Company he shaped his course towards the Isles of the Azores , and passsing towards the Isle of Saint Michael , within 20 . or 30 . leagues thereof , it was his good fortune to meet with a Portugale Carrack called Sant Philip , being the same ship which in the voyage outward had carried the 3 . Princes of Japan , that were in Europe , into the Indies . This Carrack without any great resistance he took , bestowing the people thereof in certain vessels well furnished with victuals , and sending them courteously home into their Country : and this was the first Carrack that ever was taken coming forth of the East Indies ; which the Portugals took for and evil sign , because the ship bore the Kings own name . The riches of this prize seemed so great unto the whole Company ( as in truth it was ) that they assured themselves every man to have a sufficient reward for his travel : and thereupon they all resolved to return home for England : which they happily did , and arrived in 442 Plimouth the same Summer with their whole Fleet and this rich booty , to their own profit and due commendation , and to the great admiration of the whole kingdom . And here by the way it is to be noted , that the taking of this Carrack wrought two extraordinary effects in England : first , that it taught others , that Carracks were no such bugs but that they might be taken ( as since indeed it hath fallen out in the taking of the Madre de Dios , and fyreing and sinking of others ) and secondly in acquainting the English Nation more generally with the particularities of the exceeding riches and wealth of the East Indies : whereby themselves and their neighbours of Holland have be encouraged , being men as skilful in Navigation and of no less courage then the Portugals to share with them in the East Indies : where their strength is nothing so great as heretofore hath be supposed .
