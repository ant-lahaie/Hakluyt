state , we set forth the second time from Plimmouth , and set sail the 13 . day of December following . The 25 . day of the same month we fell with the Cape Cantin , upon the coast of Barbarie , and coasting The Isle of along , the 27 . day we found and Island called Mogador , Mogador on lying one mile distant from the main , between which arbarie ^ Island and the main , we found a very good and safe harbour for our ships to ride in , as also very good entrance , and void of any danger . On this Island our general erected a pinnace , whereof he brought out of England with him foure already framed . While these things were in doing , there came to the waters side some of the inhabitants of the country , showing forth their flags of truce , which being seen of our general , he sent his ships boat to the shore , to know what they would : they being willing to come aboard , our men left there one man of our company for a pledge , and brought two of theirs aboard our ship , which by signs showed our General , that the next day they would bring some provision , as sheep , capons and hens , and such like : whereupon our general bestowed among them some linen cloth and shoes , and a javelin , which they very joyfully received , and departed for that time . The next morning they failed not to come again to the waters side , and our general again setting out 102 our boat , one of our men leaping over rashly ashore , and offering friendly to embrace them , they set violent hands on him , offering a dagger to his throat if he had made any resistance , and so laying him on a horse , carried him away : so that a man cannot be too circumspect and wary of himself among such miscreants . Our pinnace being finished , we departed from this place the 30 . and last day of December
