part , after their shipwreck , were brought unto Edenborough in Scotland , and being miserably needy and naked , were there clothed at the liberality of the King and the Merchants , and afterwards were secretly shipped for Spaine ; but the Scotish fleet wherein they passed touching at Yarmouth on the coast of Norfolke , were there stayed for a time until the Counsels pleasure was known ; who in regard of their manifold misery ' s , though they were enemies , winked at their passage . Upon the Irish coast many of their Noblemen and Gentlemen were drowned ; and diverse slain by the barbarous and wild Irish . Howbeit there was brought prisoner out of Ireland , DONE Alonzo de Lu ^ on , Colonel of two and thirtie bands , commonly called a terza of Naples ; together with Rodorigo de Lasso , and two others of the family of Cordova , who were committed unto the custody of Sir Horatio Palavicini , that Monsieur de Teligny the son of Monsieur de la Notie ( who being taken in fight near Antwerpe , was detained prisoner in the Castle of Turney ) might be ransomed for them by way of exchange . To conclude , there was no famous nor worthy family in all Spaine , which in this expedition lost not a son , a brother , or a kinse - man . New coins stamped fir the memory of the Spaniards overthrow . For the perpetuali memory of this matter , the Zelanders caused new coin of Silver and brass to be stamped : which on the one side contained the arms of Zeland , with this inscription : GLORY TO GOD ONLY : and on the other side , the pictures of certain great ships , with these words : THE SPANISH FLEET : and in the circumference about the ships : IT CAME , WENT , AND WAS . Anno 1588 . That is to say , the Spanish fleet came , went , and was vanquished this year ; for which , glory be given to God only .
