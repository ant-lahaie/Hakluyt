the 20 day of October they put fire in the undermines , weening to have cast down the wall , but they could not : then they would have pulled it down with great ropes and ancres , but the artillery of the bulwark of Auvergne brake their ropes , and sent them away lightly . At the last they made a mine under the said wall and breach : and the 26 day of the same month they did put fire to the same mine , weening to have overthrown the wall , which it did not , but raised it , and made it to fallen almost straight upright , which was more disadvantage to the enemies then profit . Then they shot artillery at it , which in few days beatrice it down , and they had opening and way to come into the Town . Nevertheless it was not necessary for them as then to enter : for the artillery of our repairs beatrice them in the forepart , and the artillery lying at the two mills at the postern of Quosquino , and in that of England , whereas was a basilisk that beatrice right upon the breach with other pieces : and therefore the enemies sought other means , and began to raise the earth between our two walls , drawing towards the bulwark of England on the one side , and towards Auvergne on the other side , and would have [ II i . 87 . ] cut the wall further then our traverses were for to come in unbeaten of our artillery . Then were the repairs enlarged and made greater with the wall that was cut , of the height of twelve , & 16 foot in breadth : and so the enemies might go no further forward , but shot great artillery against our repairs , for to break and cast them down , and also they made trenches for to come right to the breach , and unto the repairs : and certainly we looked day by day , and hour by hour for to have some assault .
