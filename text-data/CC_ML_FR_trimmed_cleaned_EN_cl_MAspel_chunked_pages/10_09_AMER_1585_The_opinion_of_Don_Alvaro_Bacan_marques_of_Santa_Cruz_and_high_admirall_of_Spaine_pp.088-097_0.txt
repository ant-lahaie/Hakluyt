The damage which may be done bypassing by the river of Jenero into the South sea . The opinion of DONE Alvaro Ba ^ an , Marks of Santa Cruz , and high Admiral of Spaine , touching the army of sir Francis Drake lying at the Isles of Bayona in Galicia , written in Lisbon the 26 of October after the account of Spaine in the year 1585 . THat which it seems unto me , that the English army may do , if they seek to pass unto the West Indies , and enter into the South sea ( as Francis Drake hath done once before ) with their thirty ships and galleons , and many pinnaces and shalops with oars , which they have with them , and 5000 men of war , which they of Bayona think to be in the fleet , is as follows .

So that the fleet remaining all this month of October on the coast of Galicia , it may come to the river of Jenero in the end of December . At the entry of the bay of the river
