, all their doing is but mean . And now to the effect of their wars : They are men without all order in the field . For they run hurling on heaps , and for the most part they never give battle to their enemies : but that which they do , they do it all by stealth . But I believe they be such men for hard living as are not under the sun : for no cold will hurt them . Yea and though they lie in the field two months , at such time as it shall freeze more then a yard thick , the common soldier hath neither tent nor any thing else over his head : the most defence they have against the weather is a felt , which is set against the wind and weather , and when Snow comes he does cast it off , and makes him a fire , and layeth him down thereby . Thus do the most of all his men , except they be gentlemen which have other provision of their own . Their lying in the field is not so strange as is their hardness : for every man must carry & make provision for himself & his horse for a month or two , which is very wondered . For he himself shall live upon water & otemeale mingled together cold , and drink water thereto : his horse shall eat green wood , & such like baggage , & shall stand open in the cold field without covert , & yet will he labour & serve him right well . I pray you among all our boasting warriors how many should we find to endure the field with them but one month . I know no such region about us that bears that name for 230 1553 - man & beast . Now what might be made of these men if they were trained & broken to order and knowledge of civil wars ? If this Prince had within his countries ' such men as could make them to understand you things aforesaid , I do believe
