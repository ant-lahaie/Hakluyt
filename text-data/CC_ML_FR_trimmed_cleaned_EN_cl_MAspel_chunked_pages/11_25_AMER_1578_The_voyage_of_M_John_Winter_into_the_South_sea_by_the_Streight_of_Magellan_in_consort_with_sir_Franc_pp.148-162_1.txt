we sent our boat to found the depth , and at the return thereof we understood by our men that the haven was without danger , having five fathoms of water fist by the rocks entering in upon the point of the Island : wherefore we entered in with our whole 1577 - Mogador and Island on the coast of Barbary . fleet the 27 of December . The Moors that were on the main seeing our ships ride there , came from the mountains to behold us : whom our general , M . Francis Drake espying , showed to them a white flag in token of friendship , and sent his boat to shore with one of our men , which not long before had be captive in the country , and partly understood their language , to talk with them . When the boat came to shore , the said man went on land to them : to whom they showed many tokens of friendship , casting up their eyes to heaven , and after looking down upon the ground , as though they had sworn by heaven and earth , promising peace . That done two of them came aboard to our general , and our man stayed on shore for a pledge . These two Moors , after they had made good cheer , and received certain gifts of our general went to shore again , and our man came aboard also . But the crafty slaves having devised to betray us , came the next day along the sea side with certain camels as though they had brought some merchandise to traffic with us : to whom our General sent certain of our men in the boat to learn what they had brought , giving charge that none of them should go on land . But the boat being near the shore one of our men more hasty then wise leapt to shore ; whom the Moors immediately took by force , and setting him on horseback carried him away into the mountains , so that we saw him no more after that time .
