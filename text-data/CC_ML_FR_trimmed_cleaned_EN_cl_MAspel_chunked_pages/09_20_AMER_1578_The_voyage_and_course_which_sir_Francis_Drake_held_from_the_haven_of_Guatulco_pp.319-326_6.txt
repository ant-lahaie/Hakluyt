They entreated us , that being absent we would remember them , and by stealth provided a sacrifice , which we misliked . Our necessary business being ended , our general Great heards with his company traveled up into the Country to their Â° f Dear . villages , where we found herds of Dear by a thousand in a company , being most large and fat of body . We found the whole country to be a warren of a Abundance of strange kind of Conies , their bodies in bigness as be stran & conies - the Barbary Conies , their heads as the heads of ours , the feet of a Want , and the tail of a Rat being of great length : under her chin on either side a bag , into the which she gathereth her meat when she hath filled her belly abroad . The people eat their bodies , and make great account of their skins , for their Kings coat was made of them . Our general called this country , Nova Albion , and Nova Albion . that for two causes : the one in respect of the white banks and cliffs , which lie towards the sea : and the other , because it might have some affinity with our Country in name , which sometime was so called . There is no part of earth here to be taken up , Gold and wherein there is not some speciali likelihood of gold or silver in the silver earth of Nova At our departure hence our general set up a monument of our being there ; as also of her Majesties right and title to the same , namely a plate nailed upon a fair great post , whereupon was engraven her Majesties name , the day and year of our arrival there , with the free giving up of the Province and people into her Majesties hands , together with her highness picture and arms , in 325 a piece of sixe pence of current English money under the plate , where under was also written the name of our general . It seems that the Spaniards hitherto had never be in this part of the country , neither did ever discover the land by many degrees to the Southwards of this place .
