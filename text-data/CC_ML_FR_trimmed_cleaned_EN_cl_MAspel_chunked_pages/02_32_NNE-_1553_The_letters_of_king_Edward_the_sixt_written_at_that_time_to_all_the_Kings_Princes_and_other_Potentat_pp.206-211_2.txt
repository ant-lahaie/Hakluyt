desire you kings & princes , 210 and all other , to whom there is any power on the earth , to permit unto these our servants free passage by your regions and dominions : for they shall not touch any thing of yours unwilling unto you . Consider you that they also are men . If therefore they shall stand in need of any thing , we desire you of all humanity , and for the nobility which is in you , to aid and help them with such things as they lack , receiving again of them such things as they shall be able to give you in recompense . Show your selves so towards them , as you would that we and our subject ' s should show ourselves towards your servants , if at any time they shall pass by our regions . Thus doing , we promise you by the God of all things that are contained in heaven , earth , and the Sea , and by the life and tranquillity of our kingdoms , that we will with like humanity accept your servants , if at any time they shall come to our kingdoms , where they shall as friendly and gently be entertained , as if they were born in our Dominions , that we may hereby recompense the favour and benignity which you have showed to our men . Thus after we have desired you Kings and princes , etc . with all humanity and favour , to entertain our well - beloved servants , we will pray our Almighty God , to grant you long life , and peace , which never shall have end .
