to Jerusalem , in which journey also he died . In the year 1075 . all the principali men of the Islands having intelligence of the death of Lagman , sent messengers unto Murecardus O - Brien King of Irland , requesting him that he would send some well - disposed person of his own kindred and blood royal , until Olavus son of Godred were come to full age . The king most willingly [ I . 11 . J condescended unto their request , and sent unto them one Dopnald the son of Tade , charging and commanding him that with all meekness and modesty , he should govern that kingdom , which of right belonged not unto him . Howbeit he , after he had once attained unto the kingdom , neglecting the commandment of his lord , usurped the government with great tyrannic , committing many heinous crimes , and so he reigned very disorderly for the space of three years . Then all the princes of the Islands making a generail conspiracy , banded themselves against him , and expelled him out of their dominions . And he flying into Irland returned no more unto them . In the year 1077 . one Ingemundus was sent from the king of Norway , to take possession of the kingdom of the Islands . And being come unto the Island of Leodus , Lewis . he sent messengers unto all the princes of the Islands to come unto him , commanding them to assemble themselves , and to appoint him to be their King . In the mean season he and his companions spent their time in robbing and rioting , ravished women and virgins , and addicted themselves to filthy pleasures and to the lusts of the flesh . And when these things were reported unto the princes of the Islands , who had assembled themselves to choose him king , being mightily incensed thereat , they made haste towards him , and coming upon him in the night , they burned the house wherein he was , and slew both him and the rest of his company , partly with sword , and partly with fire .
