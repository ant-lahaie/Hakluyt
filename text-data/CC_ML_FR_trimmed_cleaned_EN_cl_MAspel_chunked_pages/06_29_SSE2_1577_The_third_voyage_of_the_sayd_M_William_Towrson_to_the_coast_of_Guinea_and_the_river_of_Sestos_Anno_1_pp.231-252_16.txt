company from the shore , whereupon the the company resisted them , and slew and hurt diverse of them , and having put them to flight , burned their town , and brake all their boats . The 26 day our pinnace came to us from Cormatin , and had taken two pound & eleven ounces of gold : and John Sheriff told us that the Negroes of that place were very desirous to have a ship come back again to their town . The 27 we weighed and went to Cormatin . The 28 the Christopher came to us from Mowre , and trafficked there two days . The second day of June the Tiger came to us from Egrand , and the pinnace from Weamba , and they two had taken about fifty pound of gold since they departed from us . The 4 day we departed from Cormatin to ply up to Shamma , being not able to tarry any longer upon the coast for lack of victuals , and specially of drink . The 7 day we had sighed of five of the king of Portugals ships , which came to and anchor beside the castle . The 8 day George and Binny came to us , and brought with them about two pound of gold . The 10 day in the morning I took our small pinnace , and the Captain of the Christopher with me , and manned her well , and went to the castle to view the Portugals ships , and there we found one ship of about 300 tun , and foure caravels : when we had well viewed 24s them , we returned back again to our ships which we found seven leagues at sea . The 11 day in the morning we found our selves well shot towards Shamma , & the Tiger with us , but the Minion & the pinnace had not weighed that night , so that we were out of sighed of them : and having brought our selves in the weather of the Portugals ships , we came to and anchor to tarry for the Minion , or else we might have fetched Shamma .
