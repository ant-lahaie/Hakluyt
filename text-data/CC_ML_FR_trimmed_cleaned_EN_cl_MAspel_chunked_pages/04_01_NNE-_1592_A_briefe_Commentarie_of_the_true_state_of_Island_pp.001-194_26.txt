opinion may be confirmed by many reasons borrowed out of your school of Philosophy . For the natural Philosophers do teach , That it is common to all forcible flames to be quenched with dry things , and nourished with moist : whereupon even blacksmithes , by sprinkling on of water , use to quicken and strengthen their fire . For ( say they ) when fire is more vehement , it is stirred up by cold , and nourished by moisture , both which qualities do concur in water . Item , water is wont to kindle skorching fires : because the moisture it self , which arises , does prove more fatty and gross , neither is it consumed by the smoke enclosing it , but the fire it self feeds upon the whole substance thereof , whereby being made purer , and gathering round together , it becomes then more vehement by reason of cold . And therefore also wildfires cannot be quenched with water . Item , There be places abounding with brimstone and pitch , which burn of their own accord , the flame whereof cannot be quenched with water . The grand Philosopher also hath affirmed , that fire is nourished by water . Arist . 3 . de anim . And Plinie , in the second book of his natural historic cap . no . And Strabo in his 7 . book . In Nympheum there proceedeth a flame out of a rock , which is kindled with water . The same author say : The ash continually flourishes , covering a burning fountain . And moreover that there are sudden fires at some times , even upon waters , as namely that the lake of Thrasumenus in the field of IT2 Perugi , was all on fire , as the same Strabo witnesseth . And in the years 1226 , and 1236 , not far from the promontory of Island called Reykians , a flame of fire brake forth out of the sea . Yea even upon men ' s bodies sudden fires have glittered : as namely , there sprang a flame
