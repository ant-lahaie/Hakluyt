willing to bear him company , might convey himself unto all the countries of infidels . And as he was traveling towards the pope , and not far distant from the city of Pisa , there meets him by the way a certain old man , in the habit and attire of a pilgrim , saluting him by name , and saying : All hail friar Odoricus . And when the friar demanded how he had knowledge of him : he answered : Whilst you were in India I knew you full well , yea , and I knew your holy purpose also : but see that you return immediately unto the coven from whence you came , for tenne days hence you shall depart out of this present world . Wherefore being astonished and amazed at these words ( especially the old man vanishing out of his sighed , presently after he had spoken them ) he determined to return . And so he returned in perfect health , feeling no crazedness nor infirmity of body . And being in his coven at Udene in the province of Padua , the tenth day after the foresaid vision , having received the Communion , and preparing himself unto God , yea , being strong and found of body , he happily rested in the Lord : whose sacred departure was signified unto the [ II i . 67 . ] 443 Pope aforesaid , under the hand of the public notary in these words following . In the year of our Lord 1331 , the 14 . day of Januarie , Beatus Odoricus a Friar minorite deceased in Christ , at whose prayers God showed many and sundry miracles , which I Guetelus public notary of Utina , son of M . Damianus de Porto Gruaro , at the commandment and direction of the honourable Conradus of the Borough of Gastaldion , and one of the Council of Utina , have written as faithfully as I could , and have delivered a copy thereof unto the Friars minorites : howbeit not of all , because they are innumerable , and too difficult for me to write .
