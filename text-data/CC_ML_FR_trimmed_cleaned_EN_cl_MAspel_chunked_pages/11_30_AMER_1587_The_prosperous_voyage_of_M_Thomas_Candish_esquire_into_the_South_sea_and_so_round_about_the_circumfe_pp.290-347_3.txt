yet none of our men miscarried at that time , arrowes - thanked be God . Their town is marvelous artificially descrip - builded with mud walls , and built round , with their yards paled in and kept very clean as well in their â€™ streets as in their houses . These Negroes use good obedience to their king , as one of our men said , which was with them in pawn for the Negroes which came first . There were in their town by estimation about one hundred houses . The first of September there went many of our men on shore at the watering place , and did wash shirts very quietly all the day : and the second day they went again , and the Negroes were in ambush round about the place : and the carpenter of the Admiral going into the wood to do some speciali business , espied them by good fortune . But the Negroes rushed out upon our men so suddenly , that in retiring to our boats , many of them were hurt : among whom one William Pickman a soldier was shot into the thigh , who plucking the arrow out , broke it , and left the head behind ; and he told the Chirurgeons that he plucked out all the arrow , because he would not have them lance his thigh : whereupon the poison wrought so that night , that he was marvelously swollen , and all his belly and privy parts were as black as ink , and the next morning he died , the piece of the arrow with the poison being plucked out of his thigh . The third day of the said month , diverse of our fleet went up 4 miles within the harbour with our boat , and caught great store of fish , and went on shore and took Limmons from the trees , and coming aboard again , saw two Bufles . The 6 . day we departed from Sierra leona , and went out of the harbour , and stayed one tide 3 . leagues from the September .
