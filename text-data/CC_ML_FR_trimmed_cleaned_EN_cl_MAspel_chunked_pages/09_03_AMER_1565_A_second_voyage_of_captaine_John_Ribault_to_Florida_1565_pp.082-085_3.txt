we have found you alive , and chiefly because we know , that the reports which have be made of you , are false . These speeches moved me in such sort , that I would needs out of hand know more , mistrusting some evil . Wherefore having accosted Captain John Ribault , & going both of us aside together out of the Fort , he signified unto me the charge which he had , praying me not to return into France , but to stay with him my self and my company , and assured me that he would make it well thought of at home . Whereupon I replied that out of this place I would do him all service : that for the present I could not nor ought not accept this offer , since he was come for no other intent then to occupy the place which I before possessed , that I could have no credit to be there commanded : that my friends would never like of it , and that he would hardly give me that counsel , if in good earnest I should demand his advice therein . He made me answer , that he would not command me , that we should be companions , & that he would built another fortress , & that he would leave mine own unto me . This notwithstanding I fully advertised him that I could not receive a greater comfort then the news which he brought me to return into France : and farther that though I should stay there , yet it must needs be that one of us both was to command with title of the Kings Lieutenant , that this could not well agree together : that I had rather have it cast in my teeth to be the poorest beggar in the world , then to be commanded in that place , where I had endured so much to inhabit and plant there , if it were not by some great Lord or Knight of the order : and that in these respects I prayed him very heartily to deliver me the letters which my Lord Admiral had written unto me , which he performed .
