The letters of the chancellor and treasurer of England , unto Frater Conradus de Jungingen , master generail of Prussia 1403 . Right reverend and mighty lord , your honourable messengers John Godeke , and Henry Moneke , the bearer hereof coming of late before the presence of our most sovereign lord the king of England and of 38 France , and being welcomed by our said lord with a cheerful and favourable countenance , they presented certain letters on your behalf unto the kings Majesty , with that reverence which beseemed them : expounding unto his highness , sundry piracies & molestations offered of late upon the sea , by his liege people 8c subject ' s unto yours , contrary to the leagues of peace and amity , which hitherto ( by Gods grace ) have be maintained and continued on both parts . In consideration of which piracies and molestations , your messengers demanded full restitution and recompense to be made , either unto the damnified parties , or unto their procurators .

And that your said messengers may partly attain their desire , we have \ Namely the ship of Edgard Scoff at Caleis . The ship of Tidman Dor - deviant and Tidman War - owen , atOrwel and
