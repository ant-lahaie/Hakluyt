we put into the Archipelago , & being among the Hands the wind scanted , & I was forced to anchor at and Hand called Micone , where I tarried 10 or 12 days , having a greek Pilot to carry t ^ eat the ship to Chio . In this mean season , there came many small boats with mysson sails to go for Chio , with diverse goods to fell , & the Pilot requested me that I would let them go in my company , to which I yielded . After the said days expired , I weighed & set sail for the Island of Chio , with which place I fell in the after noon , whereupon I cast to seaward again to come with the Island in the morning betimes . The foresaid small vessels which came in my company , departed from me to win the shore , to get in you night , but upon a sudden they espied 3 foists of Turkes coming upon them to spoil them . My Pilot , having a son in one of those small vessels , entreated me to cast about towards them , which at his request I did , and being some thing far from them , I caused my Gunner to shoot a demy - colvering at a foist that was ready to enter one of the boats . This was so happy a shot , that it made the Turke to fallen a stern of the boat and to leave him , by the which means he escaped . Then they all came to me , and requested that they might hang at my stern until day light , by which time I came before the Mole of Chio , and sent my boat on land to the merchants of that place to send for their goods out of hand , or else I would return back with all to Candia , & they should fetch their goods there . But in fine , what by persuasion of my merchant ' s English men , & those of Chio , I was entreated to come into the harbour , and had a safe assurance for 20 days
