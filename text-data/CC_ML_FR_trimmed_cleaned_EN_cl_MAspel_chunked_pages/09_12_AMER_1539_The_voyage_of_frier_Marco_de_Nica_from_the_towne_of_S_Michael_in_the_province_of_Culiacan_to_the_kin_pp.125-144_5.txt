I gave credit to his speech , because I found him to be a man of good understanding : but I deferred my departure to follow Stephan Dorantes , both because I thought he would stay for me , and also to attend the return of my messengers which I had sent unto the Sea , who returned unto me upon Easter day , bringing with them certain inhabitants of the Seacoast , and of two of the Islands . Of whom I understood , that the Islands above mentioned were scarce of victuals , as I had learned before , and that they are inhabited by people , which wear Greatpearles shells of Pearls upon their foreheads , and they say that tmd much gold they have great Pearls , and much Gold . They in - Isks ° f formed me of foure and thirtie Islands , lying one near ichare ’^ unto another : they say that the people on the Seacoast in number . ix 129 1 have small store of victuals , as also those of the Islands , and that they traffic one with the other upon rafts . This coast stretcheth Northward as is to be seen . These Indians of the Coast brought me certain Targets made of Cow - hydes very well dressed , which were so large , that they covered them from the head to the very foot , with a hold in the top of the same to look out before : they are so strong , that a Crossbow ( as I suppose ) will not pierce them .

Following his voyage through those countries , he takes possession thereof for the Emperor ' s Majesty , and of the Indians is much honoured and served with victuals .
