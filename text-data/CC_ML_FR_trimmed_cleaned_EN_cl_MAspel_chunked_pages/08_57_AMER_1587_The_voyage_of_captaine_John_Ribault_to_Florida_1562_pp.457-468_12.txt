our ships , they began to be sorry , and still demanded of me when they should return . I made them understand that the Captains will was to send them home again , but that first he would bestow apparel of them , which few days after was delivered unto them . But seeing he would not give them licence to depart , they resolved with themselves to steal away by night , and to get a little boat which we had , and by die help of the tIED to sail home towards their dwellings , and by this means to save themselves . Which thing they failed not to do , and put their enter - The 2 Indians prize in execution , yet leaving behind them the apparel escafe awa3 - which the Captain had given them , and carrying away nothing but that which was their own , showing well 467 hereby that they were not void of reason . The Captain cared not greatly for their departure , considering they had not be used otherwise then well : and that therefore they would not estrange themselves from the Frenchmen . Captain Ribault therefore knowing the singular fairness of this river , desired by all means to encourage some of his men to dwell there , well foreseeing that this thing might be of great importance for the Kings service , and the relief of the Common wealth of France . Therefore proceeding on with his intent , he commanded the anchors to be weighed and to set things in order to return unto the opening of the river , to the end that if the wind came fair he might pass out to accomplish the rest of his meaning . When therefore we were come to the mouth of the river , he made them cast anchor , whereupon we stayed without discovering any thing all the rest of the day . The next day he commanded that all the men of his ship should come up upon the deck , saying that he had somewhat to say unto them . They all came up , and immediately the Captain began to speak unto them in this manner .
