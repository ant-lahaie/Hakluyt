if they were examined of their Law and Commandments together , they should agree but in few points . They have the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in both kinds , and more ceremonies then we have . They present them in a dish in both kinds together , and carry them round about the Church upon the Priests head , and so do minister at all such times as any shall require . They be great offerers of Candles , and sometime of money , which we call in England , Soul pense , with more ceremonies then I am able to declare . They have foure Lents in the year , whereof our Lent is the greatest . Look as we do begin on the Wednesday , so they do on the Munday before : And the week before that they call The Butter week : And in that week they eat nothing but Butter and milk . Howbeit I believe there be in no other country the like people for drunkenness . The next Lent is called Saint Peters Lent , and begins always the Munday next after Trinitie sunday , and endeth on Saint Peters even . If they should break that fast , their belief is , that they should not come in at heaven gates . And when any of them die , they have a testimoniali with them in the Coffin , that when the soul comes to heaven gates it may deliver the same to Saint Peter , which declareth that the party is a true and holy Russian . The third Lent begins fifteene days before the later Lady day , and endeth on our Lady Even . The fourth Lent begins on Saint Martins day , and endeth on Christmas Even : which Lent is fasted for Saint Philip , Saint Peter , Saint Nicholas , and Saint Clement . For they foure be the principali and greatest Saints in that country . In these Lents they eat neither Butter , Eggs , Milk , nor Cheese ; but they are very straitely kept with Fish , Cabbages , and Roots .
