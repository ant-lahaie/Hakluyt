else laces of silk , set on with brooches , the sleeves thereof very long , which he weareth on his arm , ruffed up . Under that he hath another long garment , buttoned with silk buttons , with a high collar standing up of some colour , and that garment is made straight . Then his shirt is very fine , and wrought with read silk , or some gold , with a collar of pearl . Under his shirt he hath linen breeches , upon his legs , a pair of hose without feet , and his boots of read or yellow leather . On his head he weareth a white Colepecke , with buttons of silver , gold , pearl , or stone , and under it a black Fox cap , turned up very broad . When he rides on horseback to the wars , or any journey , he hath a sword of the Turkish fashion , and his bow and arrows of the same manner . In the town he 424 weareth no weapon , but only two or three pair of knives , having the hafts of the tooth of a fish , called the Morse . In the Winter time , the people travel with sleds , in town and country , the way being hard , and smooth with snow : the waters and rivers are all frozen , and one horse with a sled , will draw a man upon it 400 miles , in three days : but in the Summer time , the way is deep with mire , and traveling is very ill . The Russe , if he be a man of any ability , never goes out of his house in the winter , but upon his sled , and in Summer upon his horse : and in his sled he sits upon a carpet , or a white Bears skin : the sled is drawn with a horse well decked , with many Foxes and Wolves tails at his neck , & is conducted by a little boy upon his back : his servants stand upon the tail of the sled etc .
