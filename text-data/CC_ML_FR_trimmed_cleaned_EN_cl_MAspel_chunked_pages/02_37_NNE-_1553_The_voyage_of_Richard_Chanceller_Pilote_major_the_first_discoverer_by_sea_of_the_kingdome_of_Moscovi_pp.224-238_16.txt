And out of their Lents , they observe truly the Wednesdayes and Fridayes throughout the year : and on the Saturday they do eat flesh . 237 Furthermore they have a great number of Religious men : which are black Monks , and they eat no flesh throughout the year , but fish , milk and Butter . By their order they should eat no fresh - fish , and in their Lents they eat nothing but Coleworts , Cabbages , salt Cucumbers , with other roots , as Radish and such like . Their drink is like our penny Ale , and is called Quass . They have service daily in their Churches ; and use to go to service two hours before day , and that is ended by day light . At nine of the clock they go to Mass : that ended , to dinner : and after that to service again : and then to supper . You shall understand that at every dinner and supper they have declared the exposition of the Gospel that day : but how they wrest and twine the Scripture and that together by report it is wonderful . As for whoredom and drunkenness there be none such living : and for extortion , they be the most abominable under the sun . Now judge of their holiness . They have twice as much land as the Duke himself hath : but yet he is reasonable even with them , as thus : When they take bribes of any of the poor and simple , he hath it by and order . When the Abbot of any of their houses dieth , then the Duke hath all his goods movable and unmoveable : so that the successor buyeth all at the Dukes hands : and by this mean they be the best Fermers the Duke hath . Thus with their Religion I make and end , trusting hereafter to know it better . To the right worshipful and my singular good Uncle , Master Christopher Frothingham , give these . Sir , Read and correct ; For great is the defect .
