came of purpose with 3 . other Zabras for the treasure of S . Juan de Puerto rico : The Francis going room with them , supposing they had be our own fleet , was by them taken in sighed of our caravel . They left the Francis driving in the sea with 3 or 4 hurt and sick men , and took the rest of our men into their ships , as the prisoners which we took at S . Juan de Puerto rico told us . The 4 of November we began to unladen the Richard , one of our victuallers , which was by the next day unladen , unrigged and then sunken . Then we stood Northwest & by North : and the next morning saw the Hands of Monserrata , Redonda , Estazia , S . Christopher and Saba . The biggest of these Islands is not passed 8 leagues long . There is good ankorage in 8 , 7 , and 5 fathoms water fair white sand . Then we stood away Southwest , and on the 8 in the morning being Saturday came to and anchor some 7 or 8 leagues off within certain broken Hands called Las Virgins , which have be accounted dangerous : but we found there a very good road , had it be for a 1000 sails of ships in 14 , 12 , and 8 fathoms fair sand and good ankorage , high Islands on either side , but no fresh water that we could find : here is much fish to be taken with hooks and nets : also we stayed on shore and fowl . Here sir John Hawkins was extreme sick ; which his sickness 229 The fight at S . Juan de Puerto rico . began upon news of the taking of the Francis . The 18 day we weighed and stood North and by East into a lesser found , which sir Francis in his barge discovered the night before , and ankored in 13 fathoms , having high steep hills on either side , some league distant from our first riding .
