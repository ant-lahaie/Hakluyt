you . Touching any outlopers of our nation , which may happen to come thither to traffic , you are not to suffer , but to imprison the chief officers , and suffer the rest not to traffic at any time , and together enter in such bonds as you think meet , that both they shall not deal in the Grand Signiors dominions , and also not harm , during their voyage , any his subject ' s ships , vessels , or whatsoever other , but quietly depart out of the same country without any harm doing . And touching those there for the company , you are to defend them according to your privilege & such commandments as you have had hence , in the best order you may . In all and every your actions , at any hand , beware of rashness and anger , after both which repentance follows . Touching your dealings in their affairs of merchandise , you are not to deal 262 otherwise then in secret and counsel . You are carefully to foresee the charge of the house , that the same may be in all honest measure to the companies profit and your own health through moderation in diet , and at the best hand , and in due time to provide things needful , to save what may be : for he that buyeth every thing when he needs it , harmeth his own house , and helpeth the retailer . So as it is , in mine opinion , wisdom to foresee the buying of all things in their native soil , in due time , and at the first hand every year , as you are to send the company the particular accounts of the same expenses . Touching your self , you are to cause to be employed fifty or threescore ducats , videlicet , twenty in Soap , and the rest in Spices , whereof the most part to be Pepper , whereof we spend very much . The Spices are to be provided by our friend William Barrat , and the Soap buy you at your first arrival , for that this ship lading the same commodity will cause it to amount in price .
