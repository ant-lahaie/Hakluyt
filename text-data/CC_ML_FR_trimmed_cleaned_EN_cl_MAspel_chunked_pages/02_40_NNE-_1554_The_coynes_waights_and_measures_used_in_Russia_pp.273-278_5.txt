the other place will be saved . And yet notwithstanding our merchants may be there in the Winter to serve the Emperor and his court . The The Emperor Emperor is a great merchant himself of wax and ls sables , which with good foresight may be procured to mseife n their hands : as for other commodities there are little or none in Moscovia , beside those above rehearsed : if there be other , it is brought thither by the Turkes , who will be dainty to buy our clothes considering the charges of carriage over land . Our merchants may do well to provide for the Russes such wares as the Dutch nation doth serve them of , as Flanders and Holland clothes , which I believe , they shall 277 serve better and with less charge then they of Rye or Dorpt , or Revel : for it is no small adventure to bring their clothes out of Flanders to either of these places , and their charge not little to carry them over land to Novogrode , which is from Rye nine hundred Russian miles . This Novogrode is a place well furnished with flax , Wax , Hides , tallow and many other things : the best flax in Russia is brought thither and there sold by the hundred bundles , which is done also at Vologda , and they that bring the flax to Novogrode , dwell as near Vologda , as Novogrode , and when they hear of the utterance which they may have with our nation , they will as willingly come to them as go to other . Two sorts of They have in Russia two sorts of flax , the one is axe - called great flax , and the other small : that which they call great flax is better by foure rubbles in 100 . bundles then the small : It is much longer then the other , and cleaner without wood : and whereas of the small flax there go 27 . or 28 bundles to a shippound , there goes not of the greater sort above 22 . or 24 at the most . There are many other trifles in Russia , as soap , mats , etc . but I think there will be no great account made of them .
