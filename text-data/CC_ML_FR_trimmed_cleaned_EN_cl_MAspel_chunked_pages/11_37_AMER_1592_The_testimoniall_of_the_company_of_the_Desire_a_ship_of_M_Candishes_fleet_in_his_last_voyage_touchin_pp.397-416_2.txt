, not having a running rope whereto we may trust , and being provided only of one shift of sails all worn , our topsails not able to abide any stress of weather , neither have we any pitch , tar , or nails , nor any store for the supplying of these wants ; and we live only upon seals and muscles , having but five hogsheads of pork within board , and meal three ounces for a man a day , with water for to drink . And forasmuch as it hath pleased 398 God to separate our fleet , and to bring us into such hard extremities , that only now by his mere mercy we expect relief , though otherwise we are hopeless of comfort , yet because the wonderful works of God in his exceeding great favour towards us his creatures are far beyond the scope of men capacity , therefore by him we hope to have deliverance in this our deep distress . Also forasmuch as those upon whom God will bestow the favour of life , with return home to their country , may not only themselves remain blameless , but also manifest the truth of our actions , we have thought good in Christian charity to lay down under our hands the truth of all our proceedings even till the time of this our distress .
