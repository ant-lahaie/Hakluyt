, which I wish to them from the bottom of my heart , as ever I wished wealth to mine own person : And thereby hold me excused in the third case I write of . And for the fourth as touching my judgement , as I He can say confess it is not very deep , so I thank God I am s ° ™ what not utterly without understanding ( although 1 be poor ) much _ & therefore peradventure held out of reputation , yet God does distribute his gifts as it pleases him . I 199 have seen wise men poor in my time , & foolish men rich , and some men have more knowledge then they can utter by speech , which fault was once objected against me by a great learned man of this realm : but surely how weak soever my utterance is , my meaning is faithful and true , and I wish in my heart to your laudable company all the gain that may be , or else I pray the Lord God to confound me as a false dissembler . It grieveth me to see how of late they have been brought to great charges , beating the bush , as the old term is , & other men taking the birds : this last year having in Lappia 2 ships , as I am partly informed , they both brought not much above 300 barrels of train oil , yet am I sure there was bought beside them of the Russes , 1183 Corels , & Laps , 1183 barrels , beside 27 barrels tf oil bought q SQjj tO Jacob the Hollander , at two barrels for Golt sold zy one Wortherne dozen . And yet there is a greater barrels to a inconvenience springing , which if it take a little deeper Hollander . root it will be ( I fear ) too hard to be pulled up , which for love & good will ( God is my witness ) I write of , wishing as to my deer friends that they should look to it in time , if they mean to keep the trade of Russia or Lappia . And thus love hath compelled me to write this advertisement , which I wish to be accepted in as good part , as I with good will have written it .
