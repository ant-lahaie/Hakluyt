current being continually maintained with such force , as Jaques Cartier affirmeth it to be , who met with the same being at Baccalaos , as he sailed along the coasts of America , then either it must of necessity have way to pass from Cape Fredo , thorough this fret , Westward towards Cataia , being known to come so far , only to salve his former wrongs , by the authority before nam : or else it must needs strike over , upon the coast of Island , Norway , Finmarke , and Lappia , ( which are East from the said place about 360 leagues ) with greater force then it did from Cape de Posita causa , buona Speranda , upon the fret of Magellan , or from effec - the fret of Magellan to Cape Fredo , upon which coasts ' Jaques Cartier met with the same , considering the shortness of the Cut from the said Cape Fredo , to Island , Lappia , etc .
