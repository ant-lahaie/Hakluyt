is a fair Island and fruitful , and is inhabited by Portugals , it riseth afar off like a great whole land and high . By three of the clock this day at after noon we were thwart of Porto Santo , and we set our course Southwest , to leave the Isle of Madera to the Eastward , as we did Porto Santo . These two Islands were the first land that we saw since we left the coast of England . About three of the clock after midnight we were thwart of Madera , within three leagues of the West end of it , and by means of the high hills there , we were becalmed : We suppose we ran this day and night 30 . leagues . The fourth day we lay becalmed under the Isle of Madera , until one of the clock at afternoon , and then , the wind coming into the East , we went our course , and ran that day fifteene leagues . The 5 . day we ran 15 . leagues more . The 6 . day in the morning we raised the Isle of Tenerif . Tenerif , otherwise called the Pike , because it is a very high Island , with a pike upon the top like a loaf of Palma , sugar . The same night we raised the Isle of Palma , which is a high land also , and to the Westward of the Isle of Tenerif . Gomera . The 7 . day we perceived the Isle of Gomera , which is and Island standing betwixt Tenerif and Palma , about 12 . leagues Eastward from Palma , and 8 . leagues Westward from Tenerif : and for fear of being becalmed with the Isle of Tenerif , we left both it , and Gomera to the Eastward of us , and went betwixt Palma and Gomera . We ran this day and night 30 . leagues . Note that these Islands be 60 . leagues from Madera , and that there are 3 . Islands more to the Westward of Tenerif , nam the Grand Canaria
