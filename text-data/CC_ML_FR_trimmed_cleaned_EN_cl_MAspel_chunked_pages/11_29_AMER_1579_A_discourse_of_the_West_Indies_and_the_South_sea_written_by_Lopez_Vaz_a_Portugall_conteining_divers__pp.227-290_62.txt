: but from Panama by sea to the coast of Peru they could not trade in a long time , because of the Southerly winds blowing on this coast almost all the year long , which are a hindrance to ships sailing that way : and by land the passage was impossible , in regard of mountains and rivers : yea it was fifteene years before they passed the Island of Pearls , which is but twentie leagues from Panama .

From hence he sent one of his ships to Panama for a new supply of victuals & of men : which ship being departed , 40 of his men that remained behind made a mutiny , and passed up into the country , meaning to return by land to Panama ,
