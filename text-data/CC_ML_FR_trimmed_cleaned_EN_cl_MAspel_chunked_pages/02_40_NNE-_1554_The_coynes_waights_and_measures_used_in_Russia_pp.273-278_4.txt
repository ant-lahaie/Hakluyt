, and their dry fish they carry to Novogrode , and fell it there to the Lieflanders . The Furs and Feathers which come to Colmogro , as Sables , Beavers , Minks , Armine , Lettis , Graies , Wool - verings , and white Foxes , with Dear skins , they are brought thither , by the men of Penning , Lampas , and Powstezer , which fetch them from the Samoedes that are counted savage people : and the merchant ' s that bring these Furs do use to truck with the merchant ' s 276 I55 +- of Colmogro for Cloth , Tin , Batrie , & such other like , and the merchant ' s of Colmogro carry them to Novogrode , Vologda , or Mosco , & fell them there .
