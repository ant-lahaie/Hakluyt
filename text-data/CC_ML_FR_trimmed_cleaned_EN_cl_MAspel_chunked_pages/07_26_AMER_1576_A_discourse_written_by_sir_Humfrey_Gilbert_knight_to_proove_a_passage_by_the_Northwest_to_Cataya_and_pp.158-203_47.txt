the Portingals for the Southeast : they may return by the Northwest , that same way they do go forth , . as experience hath showed . The reason alleged for proof of the contrary may be disproved after this manner . And first it may be called in controversy , whither any current continually be forced by the motion of Primum mobile , round about the world , or no ? For learned men do diversely handle that question . The natural course of all waters is downward , wherefore of congruence they fallen that way where they find the earth most low and deep : in respect whereof > it was erst said , the seas do strike from the Northern lands Southerly . Violently the seas are tossed and troubled diverse ways with the winds , increased and diminished by the course of the Moon , hoist up & down through the sundry operations of the Sun and the stars : finally , some be of opinion , that the seas be carried in part violently about the world , after the daily motion of the highest movable heaven , in like manner as the elements of air and fire , with the rest of the heavenly spheres , are from the East unto the West . And this they do call their Eastern current , or levant stream . Some such current may not be denied to be of great force in the hight Zone , for the nearness thereof unto the centre of the Sun , and blustering Eastern winds violently driving the seas Westward : howbeit , in the temperate climes , the Sun being further off , & the winds more diverse , blowing as much from the North , the West and South , as from the East , this rule doth not effectually withhold us from travailing Eastward , neither be we kept ever back by the aforesaid Levant winds and stream . But in Magellans straight we are violently driven back Westward : Ergo , through the Northwestern straight or Anian fret shall we not be able to return Eastward ? It
