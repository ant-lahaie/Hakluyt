thence we went for Fatepore , which is the place where the king kept his court . The town is greater then Agra , but the houses and streets be not so fair . Here dwell many people both Moors and Gentiles . The king hath in Agra and Fatepore as they do credibly report 1000 . elephants , thirtie thousand horses , 1400 . tame Dear , 800 . concubines : such store of Ounces , Tigers , Buffies , Cocks & Hawks , that is very strange to see . He keepeth a great court , which they call Dericcan . Agra and Fatepore are two very great cities , either of them much greater then London and very populous . Between Agra and Fatepore are 12 . miles , and all the way is a market of victuals & other things , as full as though a man were still in a town , and so many people as if a man were in a market . They have many fine carts , and many of them carved and gilded with gold , with two wheels which be drawn with two little Buis about the bigness of our great dogs in England , and they will run with any horse , and carry two or three men in one of these carts : they are covered with silk or very fine cloth , and be used here as our Coaches be in England . Hither is great resort of merchants from Persia and out of India , and very much merchandise of silk and cloth , and of precious stones , both Rubies , Diamonds , and Pearls . The king is appareled in a white Cabie made like a shirt tied with strings on the one side , and a little cloth on his head coloured oftentimes with read or yellow .
