, for to morrow is the kings court : and therefore we would know , for that you should come into the city like captives . But for all that we were carried in as captives and with ropes about our necks as well English as the French and Spaniards . And so we were carried before the king : and when we came before him he did commit us all to ward , where we lay 15 days in close prison : and in the end we were cleared by the English Merchants to their great charges : for our deliverance cost them 700 ounces , every ounce in that country containing two shillings . And when we came out of prison we went to the Alfandica , where we continued eight weeks with the English merchants . At the end of which time being well appareled by the bounty of our merchants we were conveyed down by the space of eight days journey to S . Cruz , where the English ships road : where we took shipping about the 20 of March , two in the Anne Francis of London , and five more of us five 128 days after in the Expedition of London , and two more in a Flemish flyboat , and one in the Marry Edward also of London , other two of our number died in the country of the bloody - flux : the one at our first imprisonment at Marocco , whose name was George Hancock , and the other at S . Cruz , whose name was Robert Swancon , whose death was hastened by eating of roots and other unnatural things to slake their raging hunger in our travail , and by our hard and cold lodging in the open fields without tents . Thus of fiftie persons through the rashness of and unskilful Master ten only survived of us , and after a thousand misery ' s returned home poor , sick , and feeble into our country .
