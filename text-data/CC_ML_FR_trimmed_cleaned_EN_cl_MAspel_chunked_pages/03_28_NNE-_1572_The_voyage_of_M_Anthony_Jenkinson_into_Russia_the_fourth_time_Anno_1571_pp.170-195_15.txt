13 Also forasmuch as Ralfe Rutter a rebel to the Queens Majesty , and and enemy to his Country , and to sir William Garrard and his company , hath of long time remained here , living of the spoils and goods of the said merchant ' s , which he wrongfully detained in his hands , riotously spending the same , during the time that he was their servant , and would not come home when he was sent for , and also for that the Queens Majesty does understand , that the said Ralfe , with other his adherents , do seek by all false means to sow dissension , and break amity betwixt their Majesties , and to overthrow the trade of the said merchant ' s : Her highness request is , that the said Ralfe with his accomplices may be delivered unto me , to be carried home , and none other of her Majesties subject ' s , not being of the society of the said Sir William Garrard and his company , to be suffered to traffic within his highness dominions , but to be delivered to their Agent to be sent home : for that the said merchant ' s with great charges and losses , both by shipwreck , and riotous servants , did first find out this trade , and have continued the same these 19 . years , to their great hindrance . 14 Also whereas diverse master ' s and artificers of our 184 Nation are here in his Majesties service , and do find themselves grieved that they cannot have licence to depart home into their native Country at their will and pleasure : the Queens Majesties request is , according to her highness writing in that behalf , that not only it will please his Majesty to permit and suffer such artificers here resident in the service of his highness , to have free liberty to depart , and go home with me , if they request the same , but also all other the like , which shall come hereafter to serve his Majesty , to have free liberty to depart likewise
