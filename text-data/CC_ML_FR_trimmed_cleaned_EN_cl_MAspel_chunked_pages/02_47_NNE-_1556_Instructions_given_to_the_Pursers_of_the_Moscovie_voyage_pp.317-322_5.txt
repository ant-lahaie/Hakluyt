by fair means or threats , as you shall see and think will serve for the best . 11 Thus when the ship is full laden again , and all things aboard in good order , and that you do fortune to go a shore to the Agent for your letters , and dispatch away : you shall demand whither all the goods be laden that were brought thither , and to know the truth thereof , you shall repair to the companies storehouse there at S . Nicholas , to see if there be any goods left in the said storehouse : if there be , you shall demand why they be not laden , and note what kind of goods they be that be so left : and seeing any of the ships there not fully laden , you shall put the Agent in remembrance to lade those goods so left , if any such be to be laden , as is aforesaid . And thus God sending you a fair wind , to make speed and away . 12 Finally , when God shall send you to arrive again upon this coast in safety , either at Harewich , or else - n 321 x where , go not you aland , if you may possibly , to the end that when you be gone a shore , there may no goods be sent privily ashore to be sold , or else to be sold aboard the ship in your absence , but keep you still aboard , if you can by any means , for the causes aforesaid , and write the company a letter from the ship of your good arrival , which you may convey to them by land by some boy or mariner of the ship , or otherwise as you shall think best : and likewise when God shall send you and the ship into the river here , do not in any wise depart out of the ship that you be in , until the company do send some other aboard the ship , in your steed and place , to keep the ship in your absence .
