called this Hand Sneland . After him one Gardarus , being moved thereunto by the report which Naddocus gave out concerning Island , went to seek the said Hand ; who , when he had found Gardasholme . it , called it after his own name Gardars - holme , that is to say , Gardars lie . There were more also desirous to visit this new land . For after the two former , a certain Island . third Noruagian , called Flok , went into Island , and nam it of the ice , wherewith he saw it environed . Of ancient habitation , etc . I gather not this opinion out of these words of Saxo ( as some men do ) that Island hath be inhabited from the beginning , or ( to speak in one word ) that the people of Island were autochthones , that is , earthbred , or bred out of their own soil like unto trees and herbs ; since it is evident , that this Island scarce began to be inhabited no longer ago then about 718 years since . This is Thyle , etc . Grammarians wrangle about this name , and as yet the controversy is not decided . Which notwithstanding , 1 think might easily grow to composition , if men would understand that this Hand was first inhabited about the year of our Lord 874 . Unless some man will say that Thule King of Aegypt ( who , as it is thought , gave this name thereunto ) passed so far unto and Hand , which was at that time untilled , and destitute of inhabitants . Again , if any man will deny this , he may for all me , that it may seem to be but a dream , while they are distracted into so many contrary opinions . One affirms that it is Island : another , that it is a certain Hand , where trees bear fruit twice in a year : the third , that it is one of the Orcades , or the last Hand of the Scotish dominion
