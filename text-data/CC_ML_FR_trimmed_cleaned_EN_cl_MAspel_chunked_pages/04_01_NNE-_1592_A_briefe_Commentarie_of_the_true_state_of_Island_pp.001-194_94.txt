his own eating , this man is not to be said , that he esteems equally or more basely of his son then of his dog : whither Islanders or any other countrymen do the same . The Germane or the Danish mariners might perhaps find among us certain beggars laden with children ( for we have here a great number of them ) who in jesting manner for they are much given to trifling talk , might say : Give me this , or fell me that : and when the stranger 174 should ask , What will you give me for it ? the beggar might answer : I have ten or foureteene children , I will give you some one or more of them , etc . For this rabble of beggars uses thus fondly to prate with strangers . Now if there be any well disposed man , who pitying the need and folly of these beggars , releaseth them of one son , and does for Gods sake by some means provide for him in another country : does the beggar therefore ( who together with his son being ready to die for hunger and poverty , yields and com - mitteth his son into the hands of a merciful man ) make less account of his son then of his dog ? Such works of love and mercy have be performed by many , aswell Islanders themselves as strangers : one of which number was that honourable man Accilius Julius , being sent by the most gracious King of Denmarke into Island in the year of our Lord 1552 , who , as I have herd , took , and carried with him into Denmarke fiftene poor boys : where afterwards it was reported unto me , that by his good means every one of them being bound to a several trade , proved good and thrifty men . What if some man be driven to that pass , that he does not only fell his son , but not finding a chapman , his own self kills and eateth him ? Examples of this
