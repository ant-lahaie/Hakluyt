which you have sent us yet : for we as yet have sold none of them . And whereas we wrote unto you in our former letter , that we would send you a hundred tons of salt , by reason it is so deer here we do send you but nine tons and a half , for it cost here ten pence the bushel the first penny : namely in the Swallow 6 tons and a half , in the Philip and marry one tun and a half , and in the Jesus one tun and a half . The 4 hogsheads of round pewter go in the Swallow and in the Philip and marry N Â° 154 pieces , as is aforesaid .

Therefore in this we remit it to his and your good discretions . we send you Thomas Hawtrey which is our servant for years : our mind is he should be placed , where he may do best service . Also we send
