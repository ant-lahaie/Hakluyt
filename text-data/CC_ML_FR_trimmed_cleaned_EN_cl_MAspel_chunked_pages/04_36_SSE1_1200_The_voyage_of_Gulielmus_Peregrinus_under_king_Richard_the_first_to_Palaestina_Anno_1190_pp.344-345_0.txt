The travails of Gulielmus Peregrinus . 344 William the Pilgrim , a very excellent Poet in those days and and Englishman born , was of great fame , being much given to good letters , ( as many then were ) and bestowed his good time in the best kind of studies . He understanding of the preparation of king Richard against the Saracens , prepared himself also for the same voyage , not only as a Soldier , but as a Pilgrim also . He saw those things which happened in the Spanish Seas , and which were done in Syria and Palestina , against the Sultan the king of Babylon , and the treacherous Saracens . All which things he wrote and expressed them as it were in lively colours , as if they had be still in doing before his eyes , and handled the same Argument in Heroical verse which the forenamed Richard Canonicus did . And having finished his work he dedicated it to Hubert Archbishop of Canterburie , and to Stephen Turneham a most expert Captain of the wars , giving it this Title , The expedition of King Richard . And I doubt not but that so good a Poet as he was published many other things , but whither they be extant yea or no , I know not : but this I know , that he was a man well accounted of , and flourished in the year after the birth of Christ 1200 . under king John .
