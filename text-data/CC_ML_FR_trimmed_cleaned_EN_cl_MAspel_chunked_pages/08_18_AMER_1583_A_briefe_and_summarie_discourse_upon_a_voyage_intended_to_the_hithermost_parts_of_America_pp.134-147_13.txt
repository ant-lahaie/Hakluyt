made her return in such sort , as that this year they have multiplied three ships , to wit , one of nine score tons , another of and hundreth tons , and a third of foure score tons : which report is given by very substantiali and honest men of Plimmouth , who saw the said ships in readiness to depart on their voyage , and were aboard of some of them . Here is at this instant in the town a man of Gernesey , Lewis de Vike , who reporteth to have credibly herd , that by this last years voyage the Frenchmen god foureteene or fifteene hundreth for every one hundreth : But how soever it be , it carrieth good likelihood of some notable profit , in as as they do so greatly , and thus suddenly increase the burden and number of their ships this present year . Now , if in so little as two years time this voyage of the Northern parts be grown to such good pass as hath been declared unto you : it is worth the thinking on to consider what may be hoped for from the Southern part , which in all reason may promise a great deal more . And so , as one who was never touched with any indirect meaning , I presume to wish and persuade you to some better taking of this matter to heart , as a thing which I 146 CHRISTOPHER CARLILE â€™ S DISCOURSE a . d . do verily think will turn to your greater and more assured commodity , then you receive by any other voyage , as yet frequented of so short and safe a course as this hath : dealing herein no otherwise with you for your several small sums , then I do with my self , both for more of mine own , then is required of any one of you : beside the hazard and travail of my person , and the total employment of my poor credit , which ( I thank God ) hath hitherto passed clear and unspotted in matters of greater importance and difficulty , then is like to fallen out in this matter between you and me .
