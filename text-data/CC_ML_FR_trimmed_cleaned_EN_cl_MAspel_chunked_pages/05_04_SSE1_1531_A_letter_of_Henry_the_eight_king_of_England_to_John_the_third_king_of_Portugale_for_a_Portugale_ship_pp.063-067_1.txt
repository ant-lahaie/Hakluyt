with other goods , all which he was to bring into our kingdom of England , to the valve of 12000 ducats , as by their bills of covenant & agreement more plainly appears : it so fell out , that you aforesaid Diego your highness subject having received the said goods , very treacherously & much contrary to his covenant , to the exceeding great loss of our subject ' s , putting in by the way into and haven of Portugale , & altering his purpose of coming into England , he remains still in that haven , & likewise detaineth our subject ' s goods . Which injury ( seeing it is done in your Highness kingdom ) we hope your Highness will see reformed according to equity & right , the rather at our request , which always have had a speciali care of the causes & goods of your Highness , & of your subject ' s whensoever they come into our kingdom , whereof we made proof the last year . Wherefore we instantly request your Highness , y â€˜ you would so receive John Ratcliffe the bearer of these present letters , 8c the new appointed agent of John Gresham , which cometh into your dominions about this business , being thus commended unto you in this business , & recovering & freely bringing home of the said goods , & in remitting of the customs , unless they were sold there ( the like whereof we did towards your subject ' s ) seeing by the fraud & deceit of the patron of the ship , the wares were brought thither , & finally in dispatching you whole matter , according to justice , & so further the same by directing 66 your highness letters to your officers whom it may concern , that we may perceive , that our subject ' s right and liberty hath especially been maintained upon this our commendation . Which we will take in most thankful part , and your highness shall find us in the like or a greater matter most ready to gratify you , whom we wish most heartily well to fare . From our Court at Waltham the 15 . of October 1531 .
