, it is a great hap if she return not without making of her voyage . Their use was to depart the sixt of September , and then they made sure voyages , and now because there is a great labour about that kind of cloth to bring it to perfection , and that it be well dried , as also the greediness of the Captain that would make and extraordinary gain of his fraught , thinking to have the wind always to serve their turn , they stay so long , that at sometime the wind turns . For in those parts the winds blow firmly for certain times , with the which they go to Pegu with the wind in poop , and if they arrive not there before the wind change , and get ground to anchor , perforce they must return back again : for that the gales of the wind blow there for three or foure months together in one place with great force . But if they get the coast & anchor there , then with great labour they may save their voyage . Also there goes another great ship from Bengala every year , laden with fine cloth of bombast of all sorts , which arriveth in the harbour of Pegu , when the ship that comes from S . Tome departeth . The harbour where these two ships arrive is called Cosmin . From Malaca to Martavan , which is a port in Pegu , there come many small ships , and great , laden with pepper , Sandolo , Porcellan of China , Camfora , Bruneo and other merchandise . The ships that come from Mecca enter into the port of Pegu and Cirion , and those ships bring cloth of Wool , Scarlets , Velvets , Opium , and Chickinos , by the which they loose , and they bring them because they have no other thing that is good for Pegu : but they esteem not the loss of them , for that they make such great gain of their commodities that they carry from thence out of that kingdom
