and pertain to Spaine , as it appears by the most part of all the Cards made by the Portingals , save those which they have falsified of late purposely . But now touching that your Lordship wrote , whither that which we discovered touches any thing the foresaid coasts : once it appears plainly , that the Newfound land that we discovered , is all a main land with the Indies Occidentali , from whence the Emperor hath all the gold and pearls : and so continueth of coast more then 5000 leagues of length , as by this Card appears . For from the said New lands it proceedeth towards the Occident to the Indies , and from the Indies returns towards the Orient , and after turns Southward up till it come to the Straits of Todos Santos , which I reckon to be more then 5000 leagues . So that to the Indias it should seem that we have some title , at least that for our discovering we might trade thither as other doe . But all this is nothing near the Spicery . Now then if from the said New found lands the Sea be navigable , there is no doubt , but sailing Northward and 176 passing the Pole , descending to the Equinoctial line , we shall hit these Islands , and it should be a much shorter way , then either the Spaniards or the Portingals have . For we be distant from the Pole but thirty and nine degrees , and from the Pole to the Equinoctial be ninetie , the which added together , be and hundred twenty and nine degrees , leagues 2489 . and miles 7440 : Where we should find these Islands .
