the former edition of this pasquill , which notwithstanding the latter edition does refute : saying that the said Pastors use to preach but five times in and whole year : which two , how well they agree together , let the reader be judge , seeing it is manifest that the author himself , presently after the first edition , had scarce seen Island . So oftentimes one lie betrayeth another , according to that saying : Truth agreeth unto truth ; but falsehood agreeth neither to truth nor to falsehood . But sith it is our part not to dissemble the truth in any place , we will not deny that holy sermons , about the time wherein this sycophant lived in Island , namely in the year 1554 , were seldomer in use then they are at this day , namely , the darkness of popery being scarcely at that time dispelled . Which also is to be understood concerning the Psalms of David mumbled by the common people in Latin , as he casts us in the teeth : for the Papists grounding all the hope of their salvation in the Mass , did little regard the sermon , or doctrine . But after we were freed from that missed , it hath be ( God be thanked ) far otherwise with us : although we cannot 181 altogether excuse the dulness , sloth , and preposterous care of certain of our Pastors . Which , whither it agreeth to any of their countrymen or no , let other nations judge . The twelfth section .
