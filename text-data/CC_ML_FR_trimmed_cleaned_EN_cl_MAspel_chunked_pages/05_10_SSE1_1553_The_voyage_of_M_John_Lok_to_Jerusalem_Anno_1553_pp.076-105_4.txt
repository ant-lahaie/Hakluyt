the main but two miles , and the channel between Melleda and Zupanna is but foure or five miles over by guess , but very deep , for we had at and anchor fortie fathoms . The two Hands of Zupanna and Mezo are well inhabited , and very fair buildings , but nothing plenty save wine only . This night towards sun set it waxed calm , and we sailed little or nothing . The 24 we were passed Ragusa 14 miles , and there we met with two Venetian ships , which came from Cyprus , we thought they would have spoken with us , for we were desirous to talk with them , to know the news of the Turkes army , and to have sent some letters by them to Venice . About noon , we had scant sighed of Castle novo , which Castle a few years passed the Turke took from the Emperor , in which fight were slain three hundred Spanish soldiers , beside the rest which were taken prisoners , and made galley slaves . This Castle is hard at the mouth of a channel called Boca de Cataro . The Venetians have a hold within the channel called Cataro , this channel goes up to Budoa , and further up into the country . About suneset we were over against the hills of Antiveri in Sclavonia , in the which hills the Venetians have a town called Antiveri , and the Turkes have another against it called Marchevetti , the which two towns continually skirmish together with much slaughter . At the end of these hills endeth the Country of Sclavonia , and Albania begins . These hills are thirtie miles distant from Ragusa . The 27 we kept our course towards Puglia , and left Albania on the left hand . The 28 . we had sighed of both the maines , but we were nearer the coast of Puglia , for fear of Foists . It is between Cape Chimera in Albania and Cape otranto in Puglia 60 miles . Puglia is a plain low land , and Chimera in Albania is very high land ,
