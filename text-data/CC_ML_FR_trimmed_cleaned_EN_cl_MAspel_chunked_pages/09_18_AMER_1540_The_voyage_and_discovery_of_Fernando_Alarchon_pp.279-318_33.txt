the forfeete and hinderfeete above seven handfuls big , with a wreathed tail , but very great ; and holding up his arms above his head , he said the beast was higher then that . After this he gave me information of another old woman which dwelled towards the sea side . I spent this day in giving crosses to those people as I had done unto the former . This old man that was with me leapt on shore , 8c fell in conference with another which that day had often called him ; and here both of them used many gestures in their speech , moving their arms , and pointing at me . Therefore I sent mine interpreter out , willing him to draw near unto them , and listen what they said ; and within a while I called him , and asked him whereof they talked , and he said , that he which made those gestures said unto the other , that in Cevola there were others like unto us with beards , and that they said they were Christians , and that both of them said that we were all of one company , 306 and that it were a good deed to kill us , that those others might have no knowledge of us , lest they might come to do them harm : and that the old man had answered him , this is the son of the Sun , & our lord , he does us good , and will not enter into our houses , although we request him thereunto : he will take away nothing of ours , he will meddle with none of our women , and that to be short , he had spoken many other things in my commendation and favour : and for all this the other steadfastly affirmed that we were all one , and that the old man said , Let us go unto him , and ask him whither he be a Christian as the other 1540 .
