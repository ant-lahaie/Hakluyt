the 480 next day following : which with and Indian Canoa sailed up into the country about io leagues : afterwards they found a very fair & great river of fresh water , which they failed not to search out : they found therein a great number of Crocodiles , which in greatness pass those of Crocodiles . the river Nilus : moreover , all along the banks thereof , there grow mighty high Cypresses . After they had Cypresses . stayed a small while in this place , they purposed to follow sec ^ he their journey , helping themselves so well with the tides , Countrey0of â€˜ that without putting themselves in danger of the continual ! Ovade . peril of the Sea , they came into the country of Ovade : of whom they were most courteously received . They advertised him of the occasion wherefore they came again to visit him , and told him of the mischance , which happened unto them since their last voyages : how they had not only lost their household stuff by casualty of fire , but also their victuals which he had given them so bountifully : that for this cause they were so bold as to come once again unto him , to beseech him to vouchsafe to succour them in such need and necessity . After that the king had understood their case , he sent messengers unto his brother Covexis , to request him upon his behalf to send him some of his mill and beans , which thing he did : and the next morning , they were come again with victuals , which the king caused to be born into their Canoa . Our men would have taken their leave of him , finding themselves more then satisfied with this liberality . But for that day he would not suffer them , but retained them , and sought to make them the best cheer he could devise . The next day very early in the morning , he took them with him to show them the place where his corn grew , and said unto them that they should not want as long as all that mil did last .
