imagined that the English and Dutch men would be utterly daunted and dismayed thereat , and would each man of them retire unto his 211 own Province and Porte for the defence thereof , and transporting the army of the duke under the protection of their huge navy , they might invade England . It is reported that the chief commanders in the navy , and those which were more skilful in navigation , to wit , John Martines de Ricalde , Diego Flores de Valdez , and diverse others found fault that they were bound unto so strict directions and instructions , because that in such a case many particular accidents ought to concur and to be respected at one and the same instant , that is to say , the opportunity of the wind , weather , time , tide , and ebb , wherein they might sail from Flanders to England . Oftentimes also the darkness and light , the situation of places , the depths and shoulds were to be considered : all which especially depended upon the conveniency of the winds , and were by so much the more dangerous . But it seems that they were enjoined by their commission to anchor near unto , or about Caleis , whither the duke of Parma with his ships and all his warlike provision was to resort , and while the English and Spanish great ships were in the midst of their conflict , to pass by , and to land his soldiers upon the Downs . The Spanish captives reported that they were determined first to have entered the river of Thames , and thereupon to have passed with small ships up to London , supposing that they might easily win that rich and flourishing City being but meanly fortified and inhabited with Citizens not accustomed to the wars , who durst not withstand their first encounter , hoping moreover to find many rebels against her Majesty and popish catholics , or some favourers of the Scottish queen ( which was not long before most justly beheaded ) who might be instruments of sedition .
