There were diverse Ambassadors , & other strangers , as well Christians as heathens , diversely appareled , to the number of 600 men , which dined in the said hall , beside 2000 Tartars , men of war , which were newly come to render themselves to the Emperor , and were appointed to serve him in his wars against the Lieflanders , but they dined in other hals . I was set at a little table , having no stranger with me , directly before the Emperor ' s face . Being thus set and placed , the Emperor sent me diverse bowls of wine , and mead , & many dishes of meat from his own hand , which were brought me by a Duke , and my table served all in gold and silver , and so likewise on other tables , there were set bowls of gold , set with stone , worth by estimation 400 pounds sterling one cup , beside the plate which served the tables . There was also a Cupboard of plate , most sumptuous and rich , which was not used : among the which , was a piece of gold of two yards long , wrought in the top with towers , and dragons heads , also diverse barrels of gold and silver , with Castles on the bungs , richly and artificially made . The Emperor and all the hall throughout was served with Dukes : and when dinner was ended , the Emperor called me by name , & gave me drink with his own hand , & so I departed to my lodging .
