of degrees of latitude passing through the midst of it , another particularly annexed to the coast of New France , wherewith the error of the latitudes committed by reason of the variation of the compass might be corrected . The historic of the voyage of Jacobus Cnoyen Buschoducensis throughout all Asia , Afirica , and the North , was lent me in time passed by a friend of mine at Antwerpe . After I had used it , I restored it again : after many years I required it again of my friend , but he had forgotten of whom he had borrowed it . The writings of Gulielmus Tripolitanus , and Joannes de Plano Carpini I never saw : only I found certain pieces of them in other written hand books . I am glad the Epitome of Abilfada is translated , I would we might have it shortly . Thus much Sir I thought good to answer your letters : if there be any thing else that you would require of me , I will most willingly communicate it with you , craving this likewise of your courtesy , that whatsoever observations of both these voyages shall come to your hands , you would impart them to me , they shall all remain with me according to your discretion and pleasure , and whatsoever I gather of them , I will faithfully signify unto you by letters , if happily they may yield any help or light unto this most excellent enterprise of navigation , and most profitable to our Christian common wealth . Fare you well most learned friend . At Duisburg in Cliveland , 28 . of Julie , the year , 1580 . At Arthur his return I pray you learn of him the things I have requested , and whither any where in his voyage , he found the sea fresh , or not very salt : for 281 I suppose the Sea between Nova Zembla and Tabin to be fresh . Yours wholly to my power to be commanded , Gerardus Mercator . May . June . Keen and Island , of Norway .
