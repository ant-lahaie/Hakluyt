the said sir William Garret , with his company hath sustained of late years in this trade , as well by Shipwreck , as by false servants it is manifestly known : and what service the said companies Ships did unto thy Majesty against thy enemies , two years passed III 177 M in going to the Narve , when they fought with the king of Poles ships Freebooters , and burned the same and slew the people , and as many as were taken alive delivered unto thy Captain at the Narve , I trust thy highness does not forget . Wherefore most mighty prince , the premises considered , the Queen her most excellent Majesty thy loving sister , doth request thy highness to restore the said sir William Garret with his company into thy princely favour again , with their privileges for free traffic with thy accustomed goodness and justice , to be ministered unto them throughout all thy Majesties dominions , as aforetime : and that the same may be signified by thy Princely letters , directed to thy officers in all places , and thy highness commandment or restraint to the contrary notwithstanding . And further that it will please thy Majesty , not to give credit to false reports , and untrue suggestions of such as are enemies , and such as neither would have mutual amity to continue betwixt your Majesties , nor yet intercourse betwixt your countries . And such rebels of our nation , as Ralfe Rutter , and others which lie lurking here in thy highness dominions , seeking to sow dissensions betwixt your Majesties by false surmises , spending away their master ' s goods riotously , and will not come home to give up their accounts , advancing themselves to be merchant ' s , and able to serve thy highness of all things fit for thy treasury , whereas indeed they be of no credit , nor able of themselves to do thy Majesty any service at all : the Queens highness request is , that it would please thy Majesty to command that such persons may be delivered unto me to be carried
