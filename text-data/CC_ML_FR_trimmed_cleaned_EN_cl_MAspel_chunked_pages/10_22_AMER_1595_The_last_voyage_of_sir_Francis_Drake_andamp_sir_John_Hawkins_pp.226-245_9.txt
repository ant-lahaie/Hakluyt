On Saturday the seventh , master Yorke captain of the Hope died of sickness , and then master Thomas Drake the Generals brother was made captain of the Hope , and master Jonas Bodenham captain of the Adventure , and master Charles Caesar captain of the Amity . The tenth day the Spaniards concluded for the ransom of the town for 24000 ducats , and one prisoner promised to pay for his ransom 4000 ducats . 234 The fourteenth day they brought in the towns ransom in pearls , but rated so deer as the general after conference with them , misliking it , sent it back again , giving them foure hours respite to clear themselves with their treasure .
