A description of the yearly voyage or pilgrimage of the Mahumitans , Turkes and Moors unto Mecca in Arabia . Lexandria the most ancient city in Africa situated by the seaside containeth seven miles in circuit , and is environed with two walls one near to the other with high towers , but the walls within be far higher then those without , with a great ditch round about the same : yet is not this City very 329 strong by reason of the great antiquity , being almost half destroyed and ruinated . The greatness of this City is such , that if it were of double habitation , as it is compassed with a double wall , it might be truly said , that there were two Alexandrias one built upon another , because under the foundations of the said City are great habitations , and incredible huge pillars . True it is , that this part underneath remains at this day inhabitable , because of the corrupt air , as also for that by time , which consumeth all things , it is greatly ruinated . It might well be said , that the founder hereof , as he was worthy in all his enterprises , so likewise in building hereof he did a work worthy of himself , naming it after his own name . This City hath one defect , for it is subject to and evil air , which only proceedeth of that hollowness underneath , out of the which issueth infinite moisture : and that this is true the air without does evidently testify , which is more subtle and wholesome then that beneath . The waters hereof be salt , by reason that the soil of it self is likewise so . And therefore the inhabitants , at such time as the river Nilus flows , are accustomed to open a great ditch , the head whereof extendeth into the said river , and from thence they convey the same within half a mile of Alexandria , and so consequently by means of conductpipes the water comes unto the cisterns of Alexandria , which being full serve the city
