upon great reasons move and invite me . Since therefore in regard of the said composition , neither you nor your subject ' s may be judged in the empire : and since plain reason requires that the one be not enriched by the others loss : as undoubtedly our subject ' s should sustain great damage by the composition aforesaid , by virtue whereof your subject ' s do enjoy all commodities in our land , and contrariwise our subject ' s in your realm have suffered , & as yet sundry ways do suffer manifold discommodities , losses and injuries . Wherefore ( most sovereign prince and mighty lord ) being reasonably moved upon the causes aforesaid , we do , by the advice of our counsellors , revoke and repeal the said composition concluded as is above written , together with the effect thereof , purely and simply renouncing the same by these presents : refusing hereafter to have either our selves or our subject ' s in any respect to stand bound by the virtue of the said composition : but from henceforth , and for the times heretofore also , be it altogether void and of none effect . Provided notwithstanding , that from the time of the notice of this denunciation given unto the hono : Mayor of your city of London , for the space of a year next ensuing , it shall be lawful for all merchants of your kingdom whatsoever , with their goods and merchandises to return home , according to the form in the foresaid composition expressed : conditionaly that our subject ' s may even so in all respects be permitted to depart , with the safety of their goods and lives out of your dominions : this present renunciation , revocation , and retractation of the 26 order and composition aforesaid , notwithstanding . Howbeit in any other affairs whatsoever , devoutly to submit our selves unto your highness pleasure and command , both our selves , and our whole order are right willing and desirous : and also to benefit and promote your subject ' s we will endeavour to the utmost of our ability . Given in our castle of Marienburg in the year of our Lord 1398 , and upon the 22 . day of February . Frater Conradus de Jungingen , master general of the Order of the Dutch knights of S .
