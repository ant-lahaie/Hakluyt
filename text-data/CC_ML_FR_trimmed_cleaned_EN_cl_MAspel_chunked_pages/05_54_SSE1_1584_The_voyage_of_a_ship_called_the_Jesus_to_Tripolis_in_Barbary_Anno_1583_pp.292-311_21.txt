Then the Venetians saved them , and they , with all the residue of the said captives , had their liberty , which were in number 150 . or thereabouts , and the said Galley , and all the Turkes treasure was confiscated to the use of the state of Venice . And from thence our two Englishmen traveled homeward by land , and in this mean time we had one more of our company , which died in Zante , and afterwards the other eight shipped themselves at Zante , in a ship of the said Marcus Segorus , which was bound for England : and before we departed thence , there arrived the Ascension , and the George Bonaventure of London in Cephalonia , in a harbour there , called Arrogostoria , whose Merchants agreed with the Merchants of our ship , and so jaded all the merchandise of our ship into the said ships of London , who took us eight in as passengers , and so we Came home , and within two months after our arrival at London , our said Purser Richard Burges , and his fellow came home also : for the which we are bound to praise Almighty God , during our lives , and as duty binds us , to pray for the preservation of our most gracious Queen , for the great care her Majesty had over us , her poor Subject ' s , in seeking and procuring of our 310 deliverance aforesaid : and also for her honourable privy Counsel , and I especial for the prosperity and good estate of the house of the late deceased , the right honourable the Earl of Bedford , whose honour I must confess , most diligently at the suit of my father now departed , traveled herein : for the which I rest continually bounden to him , whose soul I doubt not , but is already in the heavens in joy , with the Almighty , unto which place he vouchsafe to bring us all , - that for our sins suffered most vile and shameful death upon the Cross , there to live perpetually world without end , Amen .
