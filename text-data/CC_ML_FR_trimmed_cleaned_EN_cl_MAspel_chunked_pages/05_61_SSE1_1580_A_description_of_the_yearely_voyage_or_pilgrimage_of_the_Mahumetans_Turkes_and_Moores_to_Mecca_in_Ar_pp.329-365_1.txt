from one inundation to another . Within the city is a Pyramid ' s mentioned of in Histories , but not of great importance . Without the city is La colonna di Pompeio , or the pillar of Pompey , being of such height and thickness , that it is supposed there is not the like in the whole world beside . Within the city there is nothing of importance save a little castle which is guarded with 60 Janizaries . Alexandria hath three ports , one towards Rossetto , another to the land ward , & the third to the sea ward , which is called Babelbar , without which appears a broad Hand called Ghesira in the Moors tongue , which is not wholly and 330 Hand , because a Iide point or corner thereof touches the firm land , and therefore may be called Peninsula , that is to say , almost and Hand . Hereupon are built many houses of the Jewes , in respect of the air . This Peninsula is situate between two very good ports , one of them being much more safe then the other , called The old port , into the which only the vessels of Barbarie , and the sixe Galleys of the Grand Signior deputeth for the guard of Alexandria do enter . And this port hath upon the right hand at the mouth or entrance thereof a cased of small importance , and guarded but with fifteene men or thereabouts . On the other side of this Hand is the other called The new port , which name is not unfidy given unto it , for that in all men ' s judgement in times passed there hath not been water there , because in the midst of this port , where the water is very deep , there are discovered and found great sepulchres and other buildings , out of the which are daily dug with engines Jaspar and Porphyrie stones of great valve , of the which great store are sent to Constantinople for the ornament of the Mesquitas or Turkish Temples , and of other buildings of the Grand Signior .
