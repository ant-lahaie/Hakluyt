of 40 . S . sterling , upon every Camels load , which he sends his officers to receive of the Caravans , and in consideration hereof , he takes upon him to conduct the said Caravans if they need his help , and to defend them against certain prowling thieves . I and my companion William Shales came to Aleppo with the Caravan the eleventh of June , 1584 . where we were joyfully received 20 . miles distant from the town by M . William Barret our Consuli , accompanied with his people and Janissaries , who fell sick immediately and departed this life within 8 . days after , and elected before his death M . Anthonie Bore Consul of our English nation in his place , who laudably supplied the same room 3 . years . In which mean time , I made two voyages more unto Babylon , and returned by the way aforesaid , over the deserts of Arabia . And afterwards , as one desirous to see other parts of the country , I went from Aleppo to Antioch , which is thence 60 . English miles , and from thence went down to Tripolis , where going aboard a small vessel , I arrived at Joppe , and traveled to Rama , Lycia , Gaza , Jerusalem , Bethleem , to the river of Jordan , and the sea or lake of Zodome , and returned back to Joppe , & from thence by sea to Tripolis , of which places because many others have published large discourses , I surcease to write . Within few days after embarking my self at Tripolis the 22 . of December , I arrived ( God be thanked ) in safety here in the river of Thames with diverse English merchants , the 26 . of March , 1588 , in the Hercules of London , which was the richest ship of English merchants goods that ever was known to come into this realm .
