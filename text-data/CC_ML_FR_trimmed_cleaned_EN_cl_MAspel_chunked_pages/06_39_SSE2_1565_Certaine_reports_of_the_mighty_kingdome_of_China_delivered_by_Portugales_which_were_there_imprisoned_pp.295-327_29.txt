City until it was night , and then met we with and other river that joined with this , we rowed up that by the walls until we came to another bridge gallantly made of barges , but lesser a great deal then that other bridge over the greater stream : here stayed we that night , and other two days with more 3r9 quiet , being out of the press of the people . These rivers do meet without at one corner point of the City . In either of them were so many barges great and small , that we all thought them at the least to be above three thousand : the greater number thereof was in the lesser river , where we were . among the rest here lay Parai . certain greater vessels , called in their language Parai , that serve for the Tutan , when he takes his voyage by other rivers that join with this , towards Pachin , where the king makes his abided . For , as many times I have erst said , all this Country is full of rivers . Desirous to see those Parai we god into some of them , where we found some chambers set forth with gilded beds very richly , other furnished with tables and seats , and all other things so neat and in perfection , that it was wonderful . Quiacim shire , as far as I can perceive , lies upon the South . On that side we kept at our first entry thereinto , travailing not far from the high mountains we saw there . Asking what people dwells beyond those mountains , it was told me that they be thieves & men of a strange language . And because that unto sundry places near this river the mountains do approach , whence the people issuing down do many times great harm , this order is taken at the entry into Quiacim shire . To guard this river whereon continually go to & from Parai great & small fraught with salt , Fish powdered fish powdered with peper , and other necessaries for that wtth peper .
