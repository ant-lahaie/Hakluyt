not the truth of God and Religion already , it was rather to be had from us whom God so specially loved , then from a people that were so simple , as they found themselves to be in comparison of us . Whereupon greater credit was given unto that we spoke of , concerning such matters . 378 Many times and in every town where I came , according as I was able , I made declaration of the contents of the Bible , that therein was set forth the true and only God , and his mighty works , that therein was contained the true doctrine of salvation through Christ , with many particularities of Miracles and chief points of Religion , as I was able then to utter , and thought fit for the time . And although I told them the book materially and of it self was not of any such virtue , as I thought they did conceive , but only the doctrine therein contained : yet would many be glad to touch it , to embrace it , to kiss it , to hold it to their breasts and heads , and stroke over all their body with it , to show their hungry desire of that knowledge which was spoken of . The Wiroans with whom we dwelled called Wingina , and many of his people would be glad many times to be with us at our Prayers , and many times call upon us both in his own town , as also in others whither he sometime accompanied us , to pray and sing Psalms , hoping thereby to be partaker of the same effects which we by that means also expected . Twice this Wiroans was so grievously sick that he was like to die , and as he lay languishing , doubting of any help by his own priests , and thinking he was in such danger for offending us and thereby our God , sent for some of us to pray and be a means to our God that it would please him either that he might live , or after death dwell with him in bliss
