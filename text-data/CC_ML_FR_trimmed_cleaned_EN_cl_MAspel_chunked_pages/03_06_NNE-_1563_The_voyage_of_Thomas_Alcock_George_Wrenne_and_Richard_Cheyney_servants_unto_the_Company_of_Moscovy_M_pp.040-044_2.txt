as much haste as they might to the sea side , and having but foure men to send our wares to the sea side , I used such diligence , that within two days after Thomas Alcocke was slain , I sent in company with the Russes goods , all your worships goods with a Mariner , William August , and a Swethen , for that they might the safer arrive at the seaside , being safely laid in . All which goods afterwards arrived in Russeland in good condition , Master Glover having the receipt of all things which I sent then out of those parties into Russeland . Concerning my self , I remained after 1 had sent the goods into Russeland sixe weeks in Shammaki , for the recovery of such debts as were owing , and at last with much trouble recovered to the sum of fiftene hundreth rubbles or there about , which M . Glover received of me at my coming to Mosco , and all such goods as I brought with me out of Keselbash , as by a note of my hand that he hath shall appear . Also he having the receipt of all such goods as I sent into Russeland by these two above nam , he then had that voyage in venture of his own better then and hundreth rubbles , one Richard Johnson twentie rubles , one Thomas Pette fiftie rubles , one Evan Chermisin a Tartar seven tie rubles . All these had their return : M . Glover allowed himself God knoweth how , I then being in Persia in your worships affairs . And whereas he says , the Emperor had but for his part a dobble , as far as I can see , knowing what the wares cost in those parts , he had triple . If they gave him so much wares , all charges turned to your worships , as well of the Emperors as of their own returns . I have sown the seed , and other men have gathered the harvest : I have travailed both by land and by water full many a time with a sorrowful heart , aswell for the safeguard of their goods as yours , how to frame all things to the best
