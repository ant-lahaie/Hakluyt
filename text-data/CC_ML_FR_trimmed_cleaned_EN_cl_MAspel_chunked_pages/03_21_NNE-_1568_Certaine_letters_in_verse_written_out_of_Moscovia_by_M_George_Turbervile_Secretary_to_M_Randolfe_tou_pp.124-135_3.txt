deer as life : And thus they wear the winter with the Mowsike and his wife . 127 Seven months the Winter dures , the glare it is so great , As it is May before ' he turn , his ground to sow his wheat . The bodies eke that die unburied lie they then , Laid up in coffins made of fir , as well the poorest men , As those of greater state : the cause is lightly found , For that in Winter time , they cannot come to break the ground . And wood so plenteous is , quite throughout all the land , As rich , and poor , at time of death assured of coffins stand . Perhaps thou musest much , how this may stand with reason , That bodies dead can uncorrupt abide so long a season . Take this for certain troth , as soon as heat is gone , The force of cold the body binds as hard as any stone , Without offence at all to any living thing : And so they lie in perfect state , till next return of Spring . Their beasts be like to ours , as far as I can see For shape , and show , but somewhat less of bulk , and bone they be . Of waterish taste , the flesh not firm , like English beef , And yet it serv ’ s them very well , and is a good relief : Their sheep are very small , sharp singled , handful long , Great store of fowl on sea and land , the moorish redes among . The greatness of the store doth make the princes less , Beside in all the land they know not how good meat to dress . They use neither broach nor spit , but when the stove they heat , 128 GEORGE TURBERVILE ’ S LETTERS a . d . .. J 5 ^ 8 . They put their victuals in a pan , and so they bake their meat . No pewter to be had , no dishes but of wood , No use of trenchers , cups cut
