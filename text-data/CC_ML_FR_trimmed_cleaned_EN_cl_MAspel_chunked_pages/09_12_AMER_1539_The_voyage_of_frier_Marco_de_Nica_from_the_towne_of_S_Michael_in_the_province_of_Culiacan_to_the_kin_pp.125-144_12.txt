he appointeth lieutenants Ahacus . 135 under him . This townsman of Cevola is a white man of a good complexion , somewhat well in years , and of far greater capacity then the inhabitants of this valley , or then those which I had left behind me . He said that he would go with me , that I might beg his pardon : and of him I learned many particulars : he told me that Cevola was a great City , inhabited with great store of people , and having many Streets and Marketplaces : and that in some parts of this City there are certain very great houses of five stories high , wherein the chief of the City assemble themselves at certain days of the year . He sayeth that the houses are of Lime and Stone , according as others had told me before , and that the gates , and small pillars of the principali houses are of Turqueses , and all the vessels wherein they are served , and the other ornaments of their houses were of gold : and that the other sixe Cities are built like unto this , whereof some are bigger : and that Ahacus is the chiefest of them . He say that towards the Southeast there is a kingdom called Marata , and that there were wont to be many , and those great Cities , which were all built of houses of Stone , with diverse lofts ; and that these have and do wage war with the Lord of the seven cities , through which war this kingdom of Marata is for the most part wasted , although it yet continueth and maintaineth war against the other . Likewise he says , that the kingdom called Totanteac lies towards the West , which he says is a very mighty Province , replenished with infinite store of people and riches : and that in the said Kingdom they wear woollen cloth like that which I wear , and other finer sorts of woollen cloth made of the fleeces of those beasts which they described before unto me : and that they are a very civil people .
