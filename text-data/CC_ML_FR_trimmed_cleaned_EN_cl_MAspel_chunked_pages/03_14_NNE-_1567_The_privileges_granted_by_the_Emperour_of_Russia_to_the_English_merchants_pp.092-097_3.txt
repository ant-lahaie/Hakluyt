do come upon the sea , and by misfortune have their ships cast away upon those coasts of the North parts , then we will their goods to be sought out with truth , and to be delivered to sir William Garrard and his company , which as then shall be found in our country : and if that sir William Garrards company be not in the Mosco nor in our country , then we will and command that those goods of theirs shall be laid up in a place of safeguard until such time as the said sir William Garrard or his company come to demand the same : and then at their coming we will that it shall be delivered . And whereas heretofore we have given sir William Garrard and his company in this our kingdom of Mosco the new castle by the church of S . Maxim behind the market , they shall there still hold their house as heretofore we have given them , paying no custom for the same : and we also do licence them to keep one Russe porter or two , or else of their own country , and those porters shall dwell with them , and not fell for them , nor barter , nor buy for them : And also I have granted them to buy a house at Vologda and at Colmogro , or in any other place where they can choose for themselves any good harbour , and there they to set up those houses in those places at their own charges : and in Vologda or the other houses to keep two or three porters of their own , or else two or three Russes , and their wares to be laid up in those houses , and to fell their own wares at will : and the porters without them to fell none of their wares , neither yet to buy any for them . And our officers of Colmogro and Dwina , and of other our castles & towns shall not look over their wares , nor take any custom thereof : neither shall those English merchant ' s sir William Garrard and his company be judged by any of them . And when the English merchant ' s shall send from our kingdom their own people into their own country by land over other kingdoms whatsoever the be , they may without ware send their own people at their pleasure .
