came from Weopomeiok , which was divided into two parts . First for the King Okisko , who denied to be of the party for himself , or any of his especial followers , and therefore did immediately retire himself with his force into the main : the other was concerning the rest of the said province who accepted of it : and in like sort the Mandoags received the impressed . The day of their assembly aforesaid at Roanoak was appointed the 10 . of June : all which the premises were discovered by Skyco , the King Menatonon his son my 339 prisoner , who having once attempted to run away , I laid him in the bylboes , threatening to cut off his head , whom I remitted at Pemisapans request : whereupon he being persuaded that he was our enemy to the death , he did not only feed him with himself , but also made him acquainted with all his practises . On the other side , the young man finding himself as well used at my hand , as I had means to show , and that all my company made much of him , he flatly discovered all unto me , which also afterwards was revealed unto me by one of Pemisapans own men , that night before he was slain . These mischiefs being all instantly upon me and my company to be put in execution , it stood me in hand to study how to prevent them , and also to save all others , which were at that time as aforesaid so far from me : whereupon I sent to Pemisapan to put suspicion out of his head , that 1 meant presently to go to Croatoan , for that I had herd of the arrival of our fleet , ( though I in truth had neither herd nor hoped for so good adventure , ) and that I meant to come by him , to borrow of his men to fish for my company , & to hunt for me at Croatoan , as also to buy some foure days provision to serve for my voyage
