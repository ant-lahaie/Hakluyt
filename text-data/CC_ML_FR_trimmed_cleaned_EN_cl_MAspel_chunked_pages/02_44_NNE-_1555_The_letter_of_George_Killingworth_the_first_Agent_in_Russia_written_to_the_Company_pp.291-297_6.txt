bearer ( God willing ) for he that carrieth these from us is a merchant of Terwill and he was caused to carry these by the commandment of the Emperor his secretary , whose name is Ivan Mecallawich Weskawate , whom we take to be our very friend . And if it please you to send any letters to Dantiske to Robert Elson , or to William Watsons servant Dunstan Walton to be conveyed to us , it may please you to enclose ours in a letter sent from you to him , written in Polish , Dutch , Latin or Italian : so enclosed , coming to the Mosco to his hands , he will convey our letters to us wheresoever we be . And I have written to Dantiske already to them for the conveyance of letters from thence . And to certify you of the weather here , men say that 296 these hundred years was never so warm weather in this country at this time of the year . But as yesternight we received a letter from Christopher Hudson from a city called Yeraslave , who is coming hither with certain of our wares , but the winter did deceive him , so that he was feign to tarry by the way : and he wrote that the Emperors present was delivered to a gentleman at Vologda , and the sled did overthrow , and the butt of Hollock was lost , which made us all very sorry . I pray you be not offended with these my rude letters for lack of time : but assoon as sales be made , I will find the means to convey you a letter with speed : for the way is made so doubtful , that the right messenger is so much in doubt , that he would not have any letters of any effect sent by any man , if he might , for he knows not of these : and to say the truth , the way is not for him to travel in . But I will make another shift beside , which I trust shall serve the turn till he come , if sales be made before he be ready , which is and shall be as pleases God : who ever preserve your worship , and send us good sales . Written in haste . By yours to command George Killingworth Draper .
