day they never ceased shooting off of great Ordinance . From Alexandria I sailed to Argier , where I lay with The English M . Typton Consuli of the English nation , who used £° n ™ 1at me most kindly , and at his own charge . He brought me to the kings Court , and into the presence of the [ II i . 285 . ] King , to see him , and the manners of the Court : the King doth only bear the name of a King , but the greatest government is in the hands of the soldiers . The king of Potanca is prisoner in Argier , who coming to Constantinople , to acknowledge a duty to the great Turke , was betrayed by his own nephew , who wrote to the Turke , that he went only as a spy , by that means to get his kingdom . I herd at Argier of seven Galleys that were at that time cast away at a town called Formentera : three of them were of Argier , the other foure were the Christians . We found here also 13 . Englishmen , which were by force of weather put into the bay of Tunis , where they were very ill used by the Moors , who forced them to leave their bark : whereupon they went to the Council of Argier , to require a redress and remedy for the injury . They were all belonging to the ship , called the Golden Noble of London , whereof Master Bird is owner . The Master was Stephen Haselwood , and the Captain Edmond Bence . The thirde day of December , the pinnace called the Moonshine of London , came to Argier with a prize , which they took upon the coast of Spaine , laden with sugar , hides , and ginger : the pinnace also belonging to the Golden Noble : and at Argier they made sale both of ship and goods , where we left them at our coming away , which was the seventh day of Januarie , and the first day of February , I landed at Dartmouth , and the seventh day came to London , with humble thanks to Almighty God , for my safe arrival .
