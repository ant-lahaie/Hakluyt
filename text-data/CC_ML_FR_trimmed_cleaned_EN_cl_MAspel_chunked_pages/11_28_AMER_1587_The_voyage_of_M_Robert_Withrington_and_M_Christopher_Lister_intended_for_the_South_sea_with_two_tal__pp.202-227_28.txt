on our own course , and looked to our selves as well as we could . The 24 day our whole company was called together to consultation , for our best course : some would go for the West India , some directly North for England ; and in conclusion , the greater part was bent to ply for our own country , considering our necessities of victuals and fresh water , and yet if any place were offered us in the way , not to omit it , to seek to fill water . The 26 day in the morning , we espied a low Island , but we lost it again , and could descry it no more . This day we found our selves in 3 degrees and 49 minutes . The 27 day we searched what water we had left us , and found but nine buts only , so that our captain allowed but a pint of water for a man a day , to preserve it as much as might be , wherewith every man was content , and we were then in number fiftie men and boys . The first of August we found our selves 5 degrees to the Northward of the line , all which month we continued our course homeward , without touching any where : towards the end whereof , a sorrowful accident 226 1572 - 87 . fell out in our hulk , which being divided from us in Thehulkeof a calm , fell afire by some great negligence , and per - ^ s ^ ngJ > urnt ished by that means in the seas , we being not able men ne ^ any ways to help the ship , or to save the men . gence . The 4 day of September , we had brought our selves into the height of 41 degrees & 20 minutes , somewhat to the Northwards of the Islands of the Azores : and thus bulting up and down with contrary winds , the 29 of the same month , we reached the coast of England , and so made and end of the voyage .
