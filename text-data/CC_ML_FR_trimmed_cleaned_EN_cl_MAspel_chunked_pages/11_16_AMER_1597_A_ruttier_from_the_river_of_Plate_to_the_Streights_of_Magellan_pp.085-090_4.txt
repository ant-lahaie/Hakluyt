flows iz fa - coast lies Northnorthwest & Southsoutheast : 8 leagues thomes . unto Cabo de la virgin Maria , which is the entrance into Cabo de la the Strait : and 4 leagues before a man come to this vir ^ n Maria . Cape there are white clifFes with certain black spots in them ; and they be caused with the falling down of the water . Here is water enough , and thou mayest come to and anchor hard aboard the shore , and hast a good defence for a Southwest wind . And the Cape it self is the highest land of all , and is like to Cape Saint Vincent in Spaine : and it hath on the East side a ledge of rocks , and a point of sand , with diverse sands which show themselves at a low water : thou must take great heed here and give them a good breadth Ciudad de Hombre de Jesus called by M . Candish Port Famine , because he half a league or a quarter of a league ofF , until thou bring the Cape Westnorthwest , and then thou mayest fiundal the _ stir away Southwest . And when thou comest to the - _ _ _ - mtshed . and â€™ . - mished , and lower land and into tenne or twelve fathoms , then art fa tQwne thou over against la Purification . And half a league within the land the city of Number de Jesus was built , East and West with the said cape right against a clifFe , which comes from the said Cape , and goes within the Streits . This Cape stands in 52 degrees just . And this is to be taken for a warning , that he that comes near this Cape , and passes by it as I have said with the wind at Northeast , or any other wind ofF the sea inclining to the Southeast , must not come to anchor , but presently be sure to pass by ; because in self utterly abandoned , and ruined . Where Hombre de Jesus stood . Southwest winds reign much here in Summer . From March Summer this place is much subject to Southwest winds , which blow right in : and they put a man from his tackle , & make him to lose his voyage .
