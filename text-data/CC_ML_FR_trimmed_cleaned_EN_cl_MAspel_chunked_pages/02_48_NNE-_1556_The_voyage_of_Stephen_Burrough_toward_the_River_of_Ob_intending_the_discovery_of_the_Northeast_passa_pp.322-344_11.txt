we weighed , and plied to the Northwards , and as we were two leagues shot passed the Cape , we saw a house standing in a valley , which is dainty to be seen in those parts , and by and by I saw three men on the top of the hill . Then I judged them , as it afterwards proved , that they were men which came from some other place to set traps to take vermin for their furs , which traps we did perceive very thick alongst the shore as we went . 5 Sunday at and East sun we were thwart off the creek where the Russes lay , and there came to and anchor , and perceiving the most part of the Lodias to be gone we thought it not good to tarry any longer there , but weighed and spent all the ebb , plying to the windwards . 6 Munday at a South sun it was high water .

At a Northwest sun we
