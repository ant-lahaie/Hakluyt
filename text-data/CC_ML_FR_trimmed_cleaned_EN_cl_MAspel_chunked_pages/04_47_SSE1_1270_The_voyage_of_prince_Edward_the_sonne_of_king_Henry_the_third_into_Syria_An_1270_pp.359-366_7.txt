the princes arm , and threw it from them , and said unto him : how cheereth your Grace , we promise you within these fifteene days you shall show your self abroad ( if God permit ) upon your horseback , whole and well as ever you were . And according to the promise he made the prince , it came to pass , to the no little comfort and admiration of all his subject ' s . When the great Sultan herd hereof , and that the prince was yet alive , he could scarcely believe the same , and sending unto him three of his Nobles and Princes , excused himself by them , calling his God to witness that the same was done neither by him nor his 365 consent . Which princes and messengers standing aloof off from the kings son , worshipping him , fell flat upon the ground : you ( said the prince ) do reverence me , but yet you love me not . But they understood him not , because he spoke in English unto them , speaking by and Interpreter : nevertheless he honourably entertained them , and sent them away in peace . Thus when prince Edward had been eighteene months in Aera , he took shipping about the Assumption of our Lady , as we call it , returning homeward , and after seven weeks he arrived in Sicilia at Trapes , and from thence travailed thorough the mids of Apulia , till he came to Room , where he was of the Pope honorably entertained . From thence he came into France , whose fame and noble prowess was there much bruited among the common people , and envied of the Nobility , especially of the earl of Chalons , who thought to have entrapped him and his company , as may appear in the story : but Prince Edward continued forth his journey to Paris , and was there of the French king honourably entertained : and after certain days he went thence into Gascoine , where he tarried till that he herd of the death of the king his father , at which time he came home , and was crowned king of England , in the year of our Lord 1274 .
