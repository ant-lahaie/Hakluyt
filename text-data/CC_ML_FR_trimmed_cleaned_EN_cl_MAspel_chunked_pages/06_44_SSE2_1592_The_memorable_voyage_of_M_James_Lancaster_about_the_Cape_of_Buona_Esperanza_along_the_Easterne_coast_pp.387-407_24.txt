to the place where we were , whereby we had intelligence of our seven men which we left behind us at the Isle of Mona : which was , that two of them brake their necks with venturing to take fowls upon the cliffs , other three were slain by the Spaniards , which came from Saint Domingo , upon knowledge given by our men which went away in the Edward , the other two this man of New - haven had with him in his ship , which escaped the Spaniards bloody hands . From this place Captain Lancaster and his Lieutenant Master Edmund Barker , shipped themselves in another ship of Diepe , the Captain whereof was one John La Noe , which was ready first to come away , and leaving the rest of their company in other ships , where they were well entreated , to come after him , on sunday the seventh of Aprill 1594 they set homeward , and disbocking through the Cajicos from thence arrived safely in Diepe within two and fortie days after , on the 19 of May , where after we had stayed two days to refresh our selves , and given humble thanks unto God , and unto our friendly neighbours , we took passage for Rye and landed there on Friday the 24 of May 1594 , having spent in this voyage three years , sixe weeks and two days , which the Portugales perform in half the time , chiefly because we lost our fit time and season to set forth in the beginning of our voyage . We understood in the East Indies by certain Portugales which we took , that they have lately discovered the coast of China to the latitude of nine and fiftie degrees , finding the sea still open to the Northward : giving great hope of the Northeast or Northwest passage .
