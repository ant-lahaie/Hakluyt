A Letter of the Moscovie company to their Agents in Russia , Master Henrie Lane , Christopher Hudson , and Thomas Glover sent in their seventh voyage to Saint Nicholas with three ships , the Swallow , the Philip and marry , and the Jesus the fifth of May , 1560 . AFter our hearty commendations to you . The twelfth day of the last month here arrived in safety , thanks be to God , our two ships , & by them we received your letters & invoices very well perceiving what you have laden in them . The tallow came evil Trifax conditioned and broken , by reason it came in Corrobias , we loose and spoil more then the Cask will cost , and much of this tallow is very evil , black , soft and putrified . Touching the Wax , as yet we know not Wax . how the weight will rise , by reason that some of it was lost in the barks . The weight of the last years wax did not rise so well as the other years before it did . There had need good heed to be taken in the n 401 2 c weighing . Also much of this Wax had a great foot and is not so fair wax as in times past we have had . You must cause the foot to be taken off before you do weigh it , or else you must seek to have a good allowance Train oils . for it . The train Oils which you jaded this year came well conditioned , and the cask was good and of a good size . But if they were made a little bigger it were the better , for they be not hogsheads . You have written to us to send you cask which is not here to be had , neither do we think it so best if it were here , considering it must go either shaken and bound up , or else empty , which will be pesterable , and likewise will shrink and dry , and not be fit to lade oils in . Therefore our mind is , you shall cause so much cask to be made
