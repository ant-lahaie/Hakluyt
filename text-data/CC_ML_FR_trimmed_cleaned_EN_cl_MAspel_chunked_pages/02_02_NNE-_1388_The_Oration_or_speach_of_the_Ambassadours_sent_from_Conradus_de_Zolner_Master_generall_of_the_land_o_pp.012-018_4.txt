and friendship at your Highness , according to your wonted clemency : the said Master general therefore makes no doubt , that all the above written damages St molestations , being in such sort , against God and justice , oflred unto his subject ' s by yours , be altogether unknown unto your magnificence , & committed against your mind : wherefore presently upon the foresaid arrest of your merchants goods , he dispatched his messengers unto your royal majesty . Whereof one deceased by the way , namely in the territory of Holland : & the other remained sick in those parts for a long season : & so that ambassage took none effect . Wherefore the said master general was desirous to send us now the second time also unto your Highness . We do make our humble suit therefore , in the name & behalf of our Master and Order aforesaid , unto your kingly supremacy , that , having God and justice before your eyes , and also the dutiful and obsequious demeanour of the said master , and order towards you , you would vouchsafe to extend your gracious clemency , for the redress of the premises : whereby the foresaid losses may be restored and repaid unto our subject ' s . All which notwithstanding , that it would please you of your wisdom & providence to procure so absolute a remedy , by means whereof , in time to come , such dealings and inconveniences may be avoided on both parts , & finally that your merchants may quietly be possessed of their goods arrested in Prussia , and our merchants may be admitted unto the possession of their commodities attached in England , to convert & apply them unto such uses , as to themselves shall seem most convenient . Howbeit ( most gracious prince and lord ) we are to solicit your Highness , not only about the articles to be propounded concerning the losses aforesaid , but more principally , for certain sinister reports and superstitious slanders , wherewith certain of your subject ' s , not seeking for peace , have falsely informed your majesty , & your most honourable and discreet Council : affirming that at the time of the aforesaid arrest your merchants were barbarously entreated , that they were cast into loathsome prisons , drenched
