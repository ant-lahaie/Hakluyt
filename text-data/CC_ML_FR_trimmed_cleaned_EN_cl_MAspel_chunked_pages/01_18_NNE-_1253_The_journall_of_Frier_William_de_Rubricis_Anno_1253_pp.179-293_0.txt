The journal of friar William de Rubruquis a French man of the order of the minorite friars , unto the East parts of the world . An . Dom . 1253 - O his most Sovereign , & most Christian Lord Lewis , by Gods grace the renowned king of France , friar William de Rubruk , the meanest of the Minorites order , wishes health & continual triumph in CHRIST . It is written in the book of Ecclesi - Ecclus . 39 . asticus concerning the wise man : He shall travel for - +â€¢ into foreign countries , and good and evil shall he try in all things . The very same actium ( my lord and king ) have I achieved : howbeit I wish that I have done it like a wise man , and not like a fool . For many there be , that perform the same actium which a wise man does , not wisely but more undiscreetly : of which number I fear my self to be one . Notwithstanding howsoever I have done it , because you commanded me , when I departed from your highness , to write all things unto you , which I should see among the Tartars , and you wished me also that I should not fear to write long letters , I have done as your majesty enjoined me : yet with fear and reverence , because I want words and eloquence sufficient to write unto so great a majesty . Be it known therefore unto your sacred Majesty , that in the year of our Lord 1253 . about the Nonce of May , we entered into the sea of Pontus , which the Bulgarians call the great sea . It containeth in length ( as I learned of certain merchant ' s ) 1008 miles , and is in a manner , divided into two parts . About the midst thereof are two provinces , one towards the North , and another towards the South . The South province is called Synopolis , and it is the castle and port of the Soldan of Turkey :
