Plinie in like sort makes mention of a flame in a certain mountain , which , as it is kindled with water , so is it quenched with earth or hay : also of another field which burns not the leaves of shady trees that grow directly over it . These things being thus , it is strange that men should account that a wonder in Hecla only ( for I will grant it to be , for disputation sake , when indeed there is no such matter so far forth as ever I could learn of any man ) which is common to many other parts or places in the world , both hilly and plain , as well as to this .
