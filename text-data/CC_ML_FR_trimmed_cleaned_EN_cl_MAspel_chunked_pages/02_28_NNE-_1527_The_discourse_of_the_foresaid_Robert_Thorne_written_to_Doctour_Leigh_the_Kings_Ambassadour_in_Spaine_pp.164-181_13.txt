that now the Spaniards say to the Portingals , that if they would begin their 180 degrees from the said Cape Verde , to the intent they should extend more towards the Orient , and so to touch those Islands of the Spicery of the Emperor , which is all that is between the two crosses made in this Carded , that then the Islands of Cape Verde and the land of Brasil that the Portingals now obtain , is out of the said limitation , and that they are of the Emperors . Or if their 180 degrees they count from the 370 leagues beyond the said Cape Verde , to include in it the said Islands and lands of Brasil , then plainly appears the said 180 degrees should finish long before they come to these Islands of the Spicery of the Emperor : As by this Card your Lordship may see . For their limits should begin at the 340 degrees of this Card , and end at the 160 degrees , 175 New found land discovered by the Englishmen . Note . To sail by the Pole . where I have made two little marks of the compass with crosses in them . So that plainly it should appear by reason , that the Portingals should leave these Islands of Cape Verde and land of Brasil , if they would have part of the Spicery of the Emperors : or else holding these , they have no part there . To this the Portingals say , that they will begin their 180 degrees from the self same Cape Verde : for that it may extend so much more towards the Orient , and touch these Islands of the Emperors : and would win these Islands of Cape Verde and land of Brasil nevertheless , as a thing that they possessed before the consent of this limitation was made . So none can verily tell which hath the best reason . They be not yet agreed , Quare sub Judice lis est . But without doubt ( by all conjectures of reason ) the said Islands fallen all without the limitation of Portingal ,
