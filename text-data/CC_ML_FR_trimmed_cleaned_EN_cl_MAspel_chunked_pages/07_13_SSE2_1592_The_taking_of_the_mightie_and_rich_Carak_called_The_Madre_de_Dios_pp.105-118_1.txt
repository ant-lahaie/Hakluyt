as the state of his voyage did needfully require : where the Westerly winds blowing for a long time contrary to his course , bound and constrained him to keep Rarborough so many weeks , that the fittest season for his purpose was gone , the minds of his people much altered , his victuals consumed ; and withal , her Majesty understanding how crosly all this sorted , began to call the proceeding of this preparation into question : insomuch that , whereas the sixt of May was first come before sir Walter could put to sea , the very next day sir Martin Frobisher in a pinnace of my lord Admirals called The Disdain , met him , and brought to him from her Majesty letters of revocation , with commandment to relinquish ( for his own part ) the [ II ii . 195 . ] intended attempt , and to leave the charge and conduct of all things in the hands of sir John Burrough and sir Martin Frobisher . But sir Walter finding his honour so far engaged in the undertaking of this voyage , as without proceeding he saw no remedy either to salve his reputation , or to content those his friends which had put 106 THE TAKING OF THE ‘ MADRE DE DIOS ’ in adventures of great sums with him ; and making construction of the Queens letters in such sort as if her commandment had be propounded in indifferent terms , either to advance forward or to retire , at his own discretion ; would in no case yield to leave his fleet now under sail . Wherefore continuing his course into the sea , he met within a day or two , with certain sails lately come from Spaine : among which was a ship appertaining to Monsieur Gourdon governor of Caleis , and found aboard her one M . Nevel Davies and Englishman , who having endured a long and miserable captivity for the space of twelve years , partly in the inquisition in Spaine , was now by good fortune escaped , and upon return to his country .
