Their women have their necks , arms and ears decked with rings of silver , copper , tin , and with round hoops made of Ivory , adorned with amber stones , and with many agats , and they are marked with a great spot of read in their foreheads , and a stroke of read up to the crown , and so it runneth three manner of ways . In their Winter , which is our May , the men wear quilted gowns of cotton like to our mattraces and quilted caps like to our great Grocers mortars , with a slit to look out at , and so tied down beneath their ears . If a man or woman be sick and like to die , they will lay him before their idols all night , and that shall help him or make and end of him . And if he do not mend that night , his friends will come and fit with him a little and cry , and afterwards will carry him to the waters side and set him upon a little raft made of reeds , and so let him go down the river . When they be married the man and the woman come to the water side , and there is and old man which they call a Bramane , that is , a priest , a cow , and a calf , or a cow with calf . Then the man and the woman , cow and calf , and the old man go into the water together , and they give the old man a white cloth of foure yards long , and a basket cross bound with diverse things in it : the cloth he layeth upon the back of the cow , and then he takes the cow by the end of the tail , and sayeth certain words : and she hath a copper or a brass pot full of water , and the man doth hold his hand by the old men hand ,
