made satisfaction : which will be very hard and extreme dealing . Item , that in the last assembly of the said ambassadors of England and messengers of Prussia , held at Hage , made as is aforesaid , for the behalf of England , there were exhibited anew certain articles of injuries against the Prussians . The valve of which losses amounted unto the sum of 1825 . nobles and three shillings . Item , on the contrary part for the behalf of the Prussians the sum of 1355 . nobles , eight shillings and sixe pence . Item , forasmuch as diverse articles propounded , as well on the behalf of England , as of Prussia , and of the cities of the Hans , both heretofore and also at the last convention held at Hage , were so obscure , that in regard of their obscurity , there could not resolute answer be made unto them : and other of the said articles exhibited , for want of sufficient proofs , could not clearly be determined upon : it was appointed and concluded , that all obscure articles given up by any of the foresaid parties whatsoever , ought before the end of Easter then next ensuing , and within one whole year after , to be declared before the Chancellor of England , for the time being : and other articles evidently exhibited , but not sufficiently proved , to be proved , under pain of perpetuali exclusion . Which being done accordingly , complete justice shall be administered on both parts . Item , as concerning the eleventh article , for the behalf of the Prussians , first exhibited , which contained losses amounting unto the sum of 2445 . nobles : as touching 32 the first article on the behalf of England exhibited in the land of Prussia , containing losses which amounted to the sum of 900 . nobles : after many things alleged on both parts , relation thereof shall be made in the audience of the king and of the Master generail : so that they shall set down , ordain , and determine such and end and conclusion of those matters , as shall seem most expedient unto them .
