Lordship upon : I thought it good to refer them to your honourable consideration , that order might be taken in the same , for that they are apparently repugnant to the Emperors letters written to her Majesty , and do much restrain the liberty of the trade : one is , that at the last coming of our merchant ' s to the port of Saint Â« a new Michael the Archangel , where the mars is held , their ? word ' goods were taken by the Emperors officers for his Highness service at such rates , as the said officers were disposed to set upon them , so far under their valve , that the merchant ' s could not assent to accept of those princes : which being denied , the said officers restrained them of all further traffic for the space of msrc ^ ants 3 three weeks , by which means they were compelled to strMned fnm yield unto their demand how unwillingly soever , their Mart . Another is , that our said merchant ' s are driven to pay the Emperors officers custom for all such Russe money as they bring down from the Mosco to the Sea side to employ there at the Mars within the Emperors own land ; which seems strange unto me , considering the same money is brought from one place of the Country to another , and there employed without any transport over of the said money . These interruptions and impositions seem not to stand with the liberties of the 431 Emperors privileges and freedom of the intercourse , which should be restrained neither to times or conditions , but to be free and absolute : whereof it may please your Lordship to be advised , and to continue your honourable course held between the Emperor and her Majesty , to reconcile such differences as any occasion does offer to their league or traffic . Thus not doubting of your Lordship ' s furtherance herein , I humbly take my leave of your good Lordship . From her Majesties royal 1591 . palace of Whitehall this 15 of January , 1591 .
