those Spaniards which more greedily thirst after English blood , then after the lives of any other people of [ II ii . 175 . ] Europe , for the many overthrows and dishonours they have received at our hands , whose weakness we have discovered to the world , and whose forces at home , abroad , in Europe , in India , by sea and land , we have even with handfuls of men and ships , overthrown and dishonoured . Let not therefore any English man , of what religion soever , have other opinion of the Spaniards , but that those whom he seeks to win of our Nation , he esteems base and traitorous , unworthy persons , or unconstant fools : and that he uses his pretence of religion , for no other purpose but to bewitch us from the obedience of our natural Prince , thereby hoping in time to bring us to slavery and subjection , and then none shall be unto them so odious , and disdained as the traitors themselves , who have sold their Country to a stranger , and forsaken their faith and obedience contrary to nature & religion ; and contrary to that humane and general honour , not only of Christians , but of heathen and irreligious nations , who have always sustained what labour soever , and embraced even death it self , for their country , Prince , or commonwealth . To conclude , it hath ever to this day pleased God to prosper and defend her Majesty , to break the purposes of malicious enemies , of forsworn traitors , and of injust practises and invasions . She hath ever been honoured of the worthiest kings , served by faithful subject ' s , and shall by the favour of God , resist , repel , and confound all whatsoever attempts against her sacred person or kingdom . In the mean time let the Spaniard and traitor vaunt of their success , and we her true and obedient vassals , guided by the shining light of her virtues , shall always love her , serve her , and obey her to the end of our lives .
