Yet such was the great mercy & goodness of our living God , that in all this cruel terrible fight , in the end , there were not either slain or hurt by any manner of means ( excepting one mischance that happened , whereof I will by & by make mention ) many above the number of 100 . of our men : notwithstanding 249 diverse of our ships were many times shot thorough and thorough : yea and some of them no less then two and twentie times , as I was informed by credible report of the Captains and Master ' s themselves . I know not of any other hurt done , saving only that Sir Robert Southwell , who always showed himself a most valiant resolute knight in all this actium , making a little too much haste with his Pinnace to board the Philip , had there his said Pinnace burned with the Philip at the same instant , and yet by good care and diligence his men were saved . One other mischance ( as I said ) there happened , and it was thus : One of the Flemings flyboats , who had , in all the conflict before , carried himself very well and valiantly , about ten of the clock while the fight continued sharpest , chanced by great negligence and misfortune , to be fired and blown up by his own powder , who could not have any fewer in him , then one hundred fighting men by all supposal , and so in the very twinkling of and eye , both ship and men were all cast away , excepting vii . or viii . which by very good fortune , and great care and diligence of some of the other ships were saved . Immediately upon this notable victory without any farther stay in all the world , the Lord general the Earl of Essex put to shore , and landed about 3000 . shot , & pikemen : of the which number the one half was presently dispatched to the bridge Puente de Sua ? oh , under the conduct of three most famous worthy knights
