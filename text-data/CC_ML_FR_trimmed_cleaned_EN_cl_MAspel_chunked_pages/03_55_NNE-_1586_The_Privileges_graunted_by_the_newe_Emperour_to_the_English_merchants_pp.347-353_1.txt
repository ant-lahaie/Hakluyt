desired us , that we would gratify them to trade into our kingdom of Moscovia , and into our heritage of great Novogrod and Plesko , and into all parts of our kingdom , to buy and fell with their wares without custom . Therefore we for our sisters sake Queen Elizabeth , & also because that they allege that they had great loss and hindrance by the venture of the sea , and otherwise , have gratified the said English merchant ' s sir Rowland Haiward and his society , freely to come into 348 our kingdom of Moscovia , and into all our dominions with all kind of commodities , to trade , & traffic freely , & at their pleasure with all kind of their commodities : also I have commanded not to take any manner of custom for their goods , nor other customs whatsoever : That is to say , neither for passing by any place by water , nor for launching , neither for passing through any place by land , neither for the vessels or boats , nor for their heads , nor for passing over bridges , nor for ferying over at any place , neither for acknowledgement at any place where they shall come , nor any manner of custom or duty , by what name soever . Only they shall not bring with them into our dominions , neither recarie out of our dominions , or father any other men ' s goods but their own , neither fell them nor barter them away for them . Also our natural people shall not buy and fell for them , or from them , neither shall they retain or keep any of our natural subject ' s goods , or pawns by them to colour them . Also they shall not send any of their Russe servants about into any city to engross , or buy up commodities , but into what city they themselves shall come , they shall buy and sei , and shall sei their own commodities and not ours . And when they shall come into our inheritance of great Novogrod and Plesko , and through all our dominions with their commodities , then our noblemen and captains , and every one of our officers shall suffer them to depart according to this our letter
