as we term them , girts and bridles , and they have a very good commodious pace . From Bezeneger to Goa in Summer it is eight days journey , but we went in the midst of Winter , in the month of July , and were fifteene days coming to Ancola on the sea coast , so in eight days I had lost my two bullocks : for he that carried my victuals , was weak and could not go , the other when I came unto a river where was a little bridge to pass over , I put my bullock to swimming , and in the midst of the river there was a little Hand , unto the which my bullock went , and finding pasture , there he remained still , and in no wise we could come to him : and so perforce , I was forced to leave him , and at that time there was much rain , and I was [ II i . 222 . ] forced to go seven days a foot with great pains : and by great chance I met with Falchines by the way , whom I hired to carry my clothes and victuals . We had great trouble in our journey , for that every day we were taken prisoners , by reason of the great dissension in that kingdom : and every morning at our departure we must pay reseat foure or five pagies a man . And another trouble we had as bad as this , that when as we came into a new governors country , as every day we did , although they were all tributary to the king of Bezeneger , yet every one of them stamped a several coin of Copper , so that the money that we took this day would not serve the next : at length , by the help of God , we came 388 safe to Ancola , which is a country of the queen of Gargopam , tributary to the king of Bezeneger .
