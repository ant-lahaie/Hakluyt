majesty . From Havana the 20 of October 1590 . Your majesties servant , whose royal feet I kiss . John de Orimo General of your Fleet . A Letter sent from the Governor of Havana John de Trexeda , to the King of Spaine , the twentieth of October 1590 , touching the wants of that place . Y three ships which departed from this Harbour since the Fleets arrival here , I have given your majesty at large to understand , what hath happened as much as I can , and what thing is here to be done in this city , and what your majesty must provide . And now once again I will return to put your majesty in mind thereof . I beseech your majesty to command to be provided and to . be sent hither two hundred Negroes , if you will have this â„¢ fortification to go forwards : because your majesty is here at great charges with the master workman and the Officers . And for want of Pioneers the work goes not forwards . For as the work goes daily forward and increases farther and farther , so we want men to work , and to guard it , and likewise to keep it . We dare not meddle with those of the Galies . And likewise it may please your majesty to send new working tools of iron , according to a remembrance which I have sent to your majesty of late , which doth signify our wants more at large . Likewise it is needful that your majesty should send powder and match to furnish these forts . And likewise Soldiers sent to send money to pay those soldiers which are newly * Havana - come hither , & for that company of soldiers which were 159 Five Frigates made at Havana , John de Orimo General of the fleet . The excellency of the great Frygates built in Cuba . Copper mines newly found in Cuba . sent from Mexico to this place . For it behooveth your majesty not to have them as yet left , till such time
