and France . To these words answered the Archbishop of Canterburie , for he had charge so to do ; And he said , Sir king of Armenia , it is not the manner nor never was seen between two such enemies as the king of England and the French king , that the king my Sovereign lord should be required of peace , and he to enter his land with 448 1386 . a puissant army , wherefore sir , we say to you , that if it please you , you may return to the French king , and cause him and all his puissance to return back into their own [ II i . 69 . ] countries ' . And when every man be at home , then if it please you you may return again hither , and then we shall gladly intend to your treaty . This was all the answer the king of Armenia could get there , and so he dined with the king of England , and had as great honour as could be devised , and the king offered him many great gifts of gold and silver , but he would take none though he had need thereof , but alonely a ring to the valve of a hundreth Franks . After dinner he took his leave and returned unto his lodging , and the next day departed , and was two days at Dover , and there he took his leave of such lords as were there , and so took the sea in a passager , and arrived at Calais and from thence went to Sluice , and there he spoke with the French king and with his Uncles , and showed them how he had be in England , and what answer he had : the French king and his Uncles took no regard of his saying , but sent him back again into France , for their full intention was to enter into England as soon as they might have wind and weather , and the Duke of Berry and the Constable came to them : The wind was soar contrary to them , for therewith they could never enter into England but the wind was good to go into Scotland .
