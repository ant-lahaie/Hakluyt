culpable , and not minding perhaps to return any more into our realm , that they may so escape the foresaid forfeitures , and defraud us of the penalty , appertaining of right unto us , ( which abuses , if they were suffered so to go unpunished would redound unto our extreme hindrance : ) and being likewise desirous to withstand such deceitful dealing , and so far forth as we can , to prevent our own losses , we firmly command , and streightly charge you , that you do receive of every particular merchant , desirous to convey any wools , or woollen fels out of the foresaid port , into any foreign dominions , a corporal oath upon Gods holy Evangelists : that they shall avouch all those wools and woollen fels under his name unto whom they do properly belong , & under the name of none other : and then taking sufficient security from the owner of those wools and fels , or in his name , in regard whereof you will undertake to warrantise , and make good unto us those penalties and forfeitures which shall unto us appertain , for all wools , and woollen fels conveyed or sent by any of the foresaid merchant ' s unto any of the 354 said provinces of Flanders , Brabant , and Artoys , contrary to the Charter of the Proclamation and inhibition above mentioned ( if they shall chance to be convinced hereof ) that first , our due custom being received , you do permit the said wools and woollen fels to pass out of the foresaid port into foreign countries . Witness the king at Dover the 18 . day of June . By the king himself and his Council . And afterward by a Written under the Kings privy Seal there was a like commandment given unto the Collectors of the custom aforesaid in the ports underwritten . That is to say : A . D .
