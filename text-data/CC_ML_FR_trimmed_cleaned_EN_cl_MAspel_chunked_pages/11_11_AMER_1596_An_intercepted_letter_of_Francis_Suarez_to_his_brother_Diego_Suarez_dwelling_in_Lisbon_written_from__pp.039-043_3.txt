told down for foure hundred and fifty and five hundred reyes , the merchant ' s would have bought it all of me : but I would fell no more , because I meant to exchange it in Angola for Negros . Howbeit with ready money in hand in Angola a man shall buy better Negroes , and better cheap . The captain of our ship sold all his cloth for ready money for foure hundred 8c fifty reys the cubit , and thought that he had made a good market : but he hath deceived himself . I sold six broad clothes for five hundred and fifty reys the cubit : and I was offered thirty thousand reys for a cloth . Vinegar is sold for two and thirty , and sixe and thirty , and forty reals a jar , by reason there is great store of limmons and oranges in the country : but in Angola it is more worth . Olives are sold for half a real a piece : wherefore I hope to fell the hogshead for twenty thousand reys . In taffataes and velvets there will be got two hundred and fifty and three hundred for one hundred . If I had brought great store , I could have sold it all at this rate . I have already got good store of reals of plate : for it is told me that money is a good commodity in Angola . But I must employ some in meal , which is in the grinding . All the rest of my money I will send you by bills of exchange , and some part I will employ in sugars : for I have sent order to Baia for that purpose . For from this place there is no shipping that does go that way . So these letters I do send by the way of Fernambuc , and have directed them to my cousin : for I do determine to settle my self here in this country . There is come down from Peru , by this river of Plate , a merchant called Alonso Ramires , and he hath brought down with him ten or twelve thousand ducats in reals of plate , and is come down to this place to built him a ship to return into Spaine ; and there is come in his company a bishop . And thus Jesus Christ send you long health . Your loving brother Francis Suares .
