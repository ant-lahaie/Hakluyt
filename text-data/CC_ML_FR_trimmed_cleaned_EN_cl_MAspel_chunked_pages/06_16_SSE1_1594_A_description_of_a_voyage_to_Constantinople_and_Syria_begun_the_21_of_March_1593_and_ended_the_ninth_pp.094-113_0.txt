[ ii . i . 304 . ] E set sail in the Ascension of London , a new ship very well appointed , of two hundred and three score tons ( whereof was master one William Broadbanke , a provident and skilful man in his faculty ) from Gravesend the one and twentie of March 1593 .

The fourth of May we departed , and the one and twentie we arrived at Alexandretta in Cilicia in the very bottom of the Mediterrane sea , a road some 25 . miles distant from Antioch , where our merchants land their goods to be sent for Aleppo . From thence we set sail the fift of June , and by contrary winds were driven upon the coast of Caramania into a road near a little Hand where a castle stands , called Castle Rosso , some thirtie leagues to the Eastwards of the Rhodes , where after long search for fresh water , we could find none , until certain poor Greeks of the Hand brought us to a well where we had 5 or 6 tons . That part of the country next the sea is very barren & full of mountains , yet found we there and old tomb of marble , with and epitaph of and ancient Greek character , by antiquity near worn out and past reading ; which to the beholders seemed a monument of the greatness of the Grecian monarchy . From thence we went to the Rhodes , and by contrary winds were driven into a port of Candy , called Sittia :
