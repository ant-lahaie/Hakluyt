, are the Arwacas ; and beyond them the Canibals and to the South of them the Amazones . To make mention of the several beasts , birds , fish , fruits , flowers , gums , sweet woods , and of their several religions and customs , would for the first require as many volumes as those of Gesnerus , and for the rest another bundle of Decades . The religion of the Epuremei is the same which the Ingas , Emperors of Peru used , which may be read in Cieza , and other Spanish stories , how they believe the immortality of the soul , worship the Sun , and bury with them alive their best beloved wives and treasure , as they likewise do in Pegu in the East Indies , and other places . The Orenoqueponi bury not their wives with them , but their jewels , hoping to enjoy them again . The Arwacas dry the bones of their Lords , and their wives and friends drink them in powder . In the graves of the Peruvians the Spaniards found their greatest abundance of treasure : the like also is to be found among these people in every Province . They have all many wives , and the Lords fivefold to the common sort : their wives never eat with their husbands , nor among the men , but serve their husbands at meals , and afterwards feed by themselves . Those that are passed their younger years , make all their bred and drink , and work their cotton beds , and do all else of service and labour , for the men do nothing but hunt , fish , play , and drink , when they are out of the wars . I will enter no further into discourse of their manners , laws and customs : and because I have not my self seen the cities of Inga , I cannot avow on my credit what I have herd , although it be very likely , that the Emperor Inga hath built and erected as magnificent palaces in Guiana , as his ancestors did
