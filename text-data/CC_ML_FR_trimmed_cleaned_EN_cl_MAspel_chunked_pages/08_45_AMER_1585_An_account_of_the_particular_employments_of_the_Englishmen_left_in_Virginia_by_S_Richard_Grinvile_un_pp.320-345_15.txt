the King and all the rest of them after Grangemoes death , were very willing to have preferred . And he was not only by the mere providence of God during his life , a mean to save us from hurt , as poisonings and such like , 333 This skill of making wears would he learned . but also to do us very great good , and singularly in this . The King was advised and of himself disposed , as a ready mean to have assuredly brought us to ruin in the month of March 1586 . himself also with all his Savages to have run away from us , and to have left his ground in the Hand unsowed : which if he had done , there had be no possibility in common reason , ( but by the immediate hand of God ) that we could have be preserved from starving out of hand . For at that time we had no wears for fish , neither could our men skill of the making of them , neither had we one grain of Corn for seed to put into the ground . In mine absence on my voyage that I had made against the Chaonists , and Mangoaks , they had raised a brutus among themselves , that I and my company were part slain , and part starved by the Chaonists , and Mangoaks . One part of this tale was too true , that I and mine were like to be starved , but the other false . Nevertheless until my return it took such effect in Pemisapans breast , and in those against us , that they grew not only into contempt of us , but also ( contrary to their former reverend opinion in show , of the Almighty God of heaven , and Jesus Christ whom we serve and worship , whom before they would acknowledge and confess the only God ) now they began to blaspheme , and flatly to say , that our Lord God was not God , since he suffered us to sustain much hunger , and also to be killed of the Renapoaks
