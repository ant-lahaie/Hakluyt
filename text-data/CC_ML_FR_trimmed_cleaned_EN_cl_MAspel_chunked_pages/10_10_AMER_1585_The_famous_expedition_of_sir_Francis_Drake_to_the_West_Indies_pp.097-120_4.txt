to rest our selves for that night there . The Governor sent us some refreshing , as bred , wine , oil , apples , grapes , marmalad and such like . About midnight the weather began to overcast , insomuch that it was thought meeter to repair aboard , then to make any longer abided on land , and before we could recover the Fleet , a great tempest arose , which caused many of our ships to drive from their anchorhold , and some were forced to sea in great peril , as the bark Talbot , the bark Hawkins , and the Speedewell , which Speedewel was only driven into England , the others recovered us again : the extremity of the storm lasted three days , which no sooner began to assuage , but M . Carleil our Lieutenant general was sent with his own ship and three others : as also with the galley and with diverse IOI pinnaces , to see what he might do above Vigo , where he took many boats and some caravels , diversely laden with things of small valve , but chiefly with household stufie , running into the high country , and among the rest , he found one boat laden with the principal church - stuff of the high Church of Vigo , where also was their great cross of silver , of very fair embossed work , and double gilded all over , having cost them a great mass of money . They complained to have lost in all kind of goods above thirty thousand ducats in this place . The next day the general with his whole fleet went from up the Isles of Bayon , to a very good harbour above Vigo , where M . Carleil stayed his coming , aswell for the more quiet riding of his ships , as also for the good commodity of fresh watering , which the place there did afourd full well . In the mean time the Governor of Galicia had reared such forces as he might , his numbers by estimate were some two thousand foot , and three hundred horse , and marched from Bayon
