Bristow , on whom our general used his liberality , and sent him away with letters into England . But because such things are impertinent to the matter , I will return ( without any more mentioning of the same ) to that from the which I have digressed and swerved , I mean our ships now sailing on the surging seas , sometime passing at pleasure with a wished Eastern wind , sometime hindered of our course again by the Western blasts , until the 20 . day of the foresaid month of June , Frizeland . on which day in the morning we fell with Frizeland , which is a very high and cragged land and was almost clean covered with snow , so that we might see nought but craggy rocks and the tops of high and huge hills , sometime ( and for the most part ) all covered with foggy mists . There might we also perceive the great Isles of ice lying on the seas , like mountains , some small , some big , of sundry kinds of shapes , and such a number of them , that we could not come near the shore for them . Thus sailing alongst the coast , at the last we saw a place somewhat void of ice , where our general ( accompanied with certain other ) went a shore , where they saw certain tents made of beasts skins , and boats much the like unto theirs of Meta Incognita . The tents were furnished with flesh , fish , skins , and other trifles : among the which was found a box of nails : whereby we did conjecture , that they had either Artificers among them , or else a traffic with some other nation . The men ran away , so that we could have no conference or communication with them .
