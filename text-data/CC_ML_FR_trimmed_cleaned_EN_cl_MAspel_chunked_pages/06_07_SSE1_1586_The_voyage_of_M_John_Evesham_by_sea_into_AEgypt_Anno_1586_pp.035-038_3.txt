. Maries : & in the Courts where the Churches be , was the house of king Pharao . In this City is great store of merchandise , especially pepper , and nutmegs , which come thither by land , out of the East India : and it is very plentiful of all manner of victuals , especially of bred , roots , and herbs : to the Eastwards of Cayro , there is a Well , five miles off , called Matria , and as they say , when the Virgin Marie fled from Bethleem , and came into jEgypt , and being there , had neither water , nor any other thing to sustain them , by the providence of God , and Angel came from heaven , and strake the ground with his wings , where presently issued out a fountain of water : and the wall did open where the Israelites did hide themselves , which fountain or well is walled foure square till this day . Also we were at and old City , all ruinated and destroyed , Carthage , called in old time , the great City of Carthage where Hannibal and Queen Dido dwelled : this City was but narrow , but was very long : for there was , and is yet to be seen , one street three mile long , to which City fresh water was brought upon arches ( as afore ) above 2 5 miles , of which arches some are standing to this day . Also we were at diverse other places on the coast , as we came from Cayro , but of other antiquities we saw but Argier . few . The town of Argier which was our first and last port , within the straights stands upon the side of and hill , close upon the sea shore : it is very strong both by sea and land , and it is very well victualed with all manner of fruits , bred and fish good store , and very cheap . It is inhabited with Turkes , Moors , and Jewes , and so are Alexandria and Cayro . In this town are a great number of Christian captives , whereof there are of Englishmen only fifteene , from which port we set sail towards England , the seventh of Januarie , Anno 1587 , and the 30 day of the said month , we arrived at Dartmouth on the coast of England .
