the Southermost end with a little hom - mock , and swampe in the mids . The 25 . day from 4 . to 8 . a clock in the forenoon , the wind at Northwest and by North a fresh gale , I cast about to the Westward , the Southermost head of Shot - Shotland . land called Swinborne head Northnorthwest from me , and the land of Fair isle , West Southwest from me . I sailed directly to the North head of that said land , sounding as I ran in , having 60 . 50 . and 40 . fathoms , and grey red shells : and within half a mile of that Island , there are 36 . fathoms , for I sailed to that Island to see whither there were any roadesteede for a Northwest wind , and I found by my sounding hard rocks , and foul ground , and deep water , within two cables length of the shore , 28 . fathom , and so did not anchor but plied to and from with my foresail , and mizzen till it was a high water under the Island . The tide sets there Northwest and Southeast : the flood sets Southeast , and the ebb Northwest . The 26 . day having the wind at South a fair gale , sailing from Fair isle to Swinborne head , I did observe the latitude , the Island of Fowlay being West Northwest from me 6 . leagues , and Swinborne head East southeast from me , I found my * elevation to be 37 . degr . and my declination 22 . degr . 46 . min . So that my latitude was 59 . degr . 46 . min . At that present being near to Swinborne head , having a leak which did trouble us , as also to take in fresh water , I plied room with a found , which is called S . Tronions , and there did anchor in seven fathoms water , and fair sand . You have coming in the sounds mouth in the entering 17 . 15 . 12 . 10 . 9 . 8 . and 7 . fathoms , and the found lies in North northwest
