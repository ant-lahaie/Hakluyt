because the current aforesaid which comes from the East , striketh with such force upon the fret of Magellan , and falls with such swiftness and fury into Mar deal Zur , that hardly any ship ( but not possibly a Canoa , with such unskilful mariners ) can come into our Western Ocean through that fret , from the West seas of America , as Magellans experience hath partly taught us . 6 And further , to prove that these people so arriving upon the coast of Germany , were Indians , & not in - habiters of any part either of Africa or America , it is manifest , because the natives both of Africa and America neither had , or have at this day ( as is reported ) other kind of boats then such as do bear neither masts nor sails , ( except only upon the coasts of Barbarie and the 174 Turkes ships ) but do carry themselves from place to place near the shore by the over only . To prove that those Indians came not by the Northeast , and that there is no thorough navigable passage that way . Cap . 6 . IT is likely that there should be no thorough passage by the Northeast , whereby to go round about the world , because all Seas ( as aforesaid ) are maintained by the abundance of water , waxing more shallow and shelffie towards the end , as we find it doth by experience in Mare Glaciali , towards the East , which breeds small hope of any great continuance of that sea , to be navigable towards the East , sufficient to sail thereby round about the world . 2 Also , it stands scarcely with reason , that the Indians dwelling under Torrida Zona , could endure the injury of the cold air , about the Septentrional latitude of 80 . degrees , under which elevation the passage by the Northeast cannot be ( as the often experience had of all the South parts of it shows ) seeing that some of the inhabitants of this cold climate ( whose
