Per breve de privato Sigillo . Bailie . To the Worshipful and his very loving Uncle M . Rowland Hewish Esquire , at Sand in Devonshire . Ir , considering the goodness of your Nature which is wont kindly to accept from a friend , even of mean things being given with a good heart , I have presumed to trouble you with the reading of this rude discourse of my travails into Turkey , and of the delivery of the present with such other occurrents as there happened worthy the observation : of all which proceedings I was and eyewitness , it pleasing the Ambassador to take me in with him to the Grand Signior . If for lack of time to put it in order I have not performed it so well as it ought , I crave pardon , assuring you that to my knowledge I have not missed in the truth of any thing . If you ask me what in my travels I have learned , I answer as a noble man of France did to the like demand , Hoc unum didici , mundi contemptum : and so concluding with the wise man in the book of the Preacher , that all is vanity , and one thing only is necessary , I take my leave and commit you to the Almighty . From London the 16 . March 1597 . Your loving Nephew Richard Wrag . 93
