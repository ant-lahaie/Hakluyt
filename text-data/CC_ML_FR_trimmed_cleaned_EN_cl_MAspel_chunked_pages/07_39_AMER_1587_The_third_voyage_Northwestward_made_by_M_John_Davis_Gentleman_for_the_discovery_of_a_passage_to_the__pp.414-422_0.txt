The third voyage Northwestward , made by M . John Davis Gentleman , as chief captain & Pilot generail , for the discovery of a passage to the Isles of the Moluccas , or the coast of China , in the year 1587 . Written by M . John Janes . May . He 19 . of this present month about midnight we weighed our anchors , set sail , and departed from Dartmouth with two Barks and a Clincher , the one nam the Elizabeth of Dartmouth , the other the Sunshine of London , and the Clincher called the Helene of London : thus in Gods name we set forward with the wind at Northeast a good fresh gale . About 3 . hours after our departure , the night being somewhat thick with darkness , we had lost the pinnace : the Captain imagining that the men had run away with her , willed the Master of the Sunshine to stand to Seawards , and see if we could descry them , we bearing in with the shore for Plimmouth . At length we descried her , bore with her , and demanded what the cause was : they answered that the tiller of their helm was burst . So shaping our course Westsouthwest , we went forward , hoping that a hard beginning would make a good ending , yet some of us were doubtful of it , falling in reckoning that she was a Clincher ; nevertheless we put our trust in God . The 21 . we met with the Read Lion of London , which came from the coast of Spaine , which was afraid that we had be men of war , but we hailed them , and after a little conference , we desired the Master to carry our letters for London directed to my uncle Sanderson , who promised us a safe delivery . And after we had heaved them a led and a line , whereunto we had made fast our 414 1587 - letters , before they could get them into the ship , they fell into the Sea , and so all our labour and theirs also was lost ; notwithstanding they promised to certify our departure at London
