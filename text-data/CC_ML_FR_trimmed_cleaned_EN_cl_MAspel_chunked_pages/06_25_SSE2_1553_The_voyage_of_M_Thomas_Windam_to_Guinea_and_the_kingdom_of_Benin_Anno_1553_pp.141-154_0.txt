A voyage made out of England unto Guinea and Benin in Affrike , at the charges of certain merchants Adventurers of the City of London , in the year of our Lord 1553 . Was desired by certain of my friends to make some mention of this Voyage , that some memory thereof might remain to our posterity , if either iniquity of time consuming all things , or ignorance creeping in by barbarousness and contempt of knowledge should hereafter bury in obli vion so worthy attempts , so much the greatlier to be esteemed , as before never enterprised by Englishmen , or at the least so frequented , as at this present they are , , and may be , to the great commodity of our merchants , if the same be not hindered by the ambition of such , as for the conquering of fortie or fiftie miles here and there , and erecting of certain fortresses , think to be Lords of half the world , envying that other should enjoy the commodities , which they themselves cannot wholly possess . And although such as have be at charges in the discovering and conquering of such lands ought by good reason to have certain privileges , preeminences , and tributes for the same , yet ( to speak under correction ) it may seem somewhat rigorous , and against good reason and conscience , or rather against the charity that ought to be among Christian men , that such as invade the dominions of other should not permit other friendly to use the trade of merchandise in places nearer , or seidome frequented of them , whereby their trade is not hindered in such places , where they themselves have at their own election appointed the Marts of their traffic . But forasmuch as at this present it is not my intent to accuse or defend , approve or improve , I will cease to speak any further hereof , and proceed to the description of the first voyage , as briefly and faithfully as I 141 Tunis .
