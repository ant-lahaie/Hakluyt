, as Norway , Island , etc . where not finding any passage to and open Sea , but rather being there increased by a new access , and another current meeting with it from the Scythian Sea , passing the bay of Saint Nicholas Westward , it does once again rebound back , by the coasts of Greenland , and from thence upon Frobishers straights being to the Southwestwardes of the same . vii 337 y The sea moves from East to West continually . Authority . Hard but yet possible turning back again . Tsaffique . 5 And if that principle of Philosophy be true , that Inferiora corpora reguntur a superioribus , that is , if inferior bodies be governed , ruled , and carried after the manner and course of the superiors , then the water being and inferior Element , must needs be governed after the superior heaven , and so follow the course of Primum mobile from East to West . 6 But every man that hath written or considered any thing of this passage , hath more doubted the return by the same way by reason of a great downfall of water , which they imagine to be thereabouts ( which we also by experience partly find ) than any mistrust they have of the same passage at all . For we find ( as it were ) a great downfall in this place , but yet not such but that we may return , although with much ado . For we were easilier carried in one hour then we could get forth again in three . Also by another experience at another time , we found this current to deceive us in this sort : That whereas we supposed it to be 15 leagues off , and lying a hull , we were brought within two leagues of the shore contrary to all expectation . Our men that sailed furthest in the same mistaken straights ( having the main land upon their starboard side ) affirm that they met with the outlet or passage of water which comes thorough Frobishers straights , and follows as all
