. The 9 . we lay hovering all day before the town , the castle making a shot or two at us . The reason why we set the Portugall merchant aland there was , for that he hoped to help us to some money for his Negroes there , but he falsified his word with us , so that passing along to the Westermost end of the said Hand , about some 9 . or 10 . leagues from the town we landed the Negroes , and sunk their ship . The 11 . of Aprill we passed from thence to Mona some 15 . leagues ofF , where we landed : there were on the Hand about 19 . souls , the children of and old Portugal ! , and his wife who afforded us such fruits as their Hand yielded , viz . swines flesh , Potato roots , etc . From thence along we passed to Saona , a long Hand and very fruitful , replenished with store of wild beasts and swine , where we landed , hunted , and trained our men . Passing from hence Westward along the South coast of Hispaniola , we descried a frigate , which we chased and took : wherein were 22 . jars of copper - money , being bound for S . Juan de Puerto rico , to buy wine there . The next day we took 2 . small frigates more , but nothing of any valve in them . The 15 . of Aprill at night we sacked a town in the said Hand of Hispaniola called Ocoa , where was and Ingenio , wherein we found sugar 8c poultry great store , but the people had discovered our ships over night , and were fled into the mountains . This town stands a league from the seaside , consisting of some fortie or fiftie houses . They brought us much cattle , and two wain loads of sugar , to ransom the town . While this actium was performed , Robert Freed of Harwich , captain of the Margaret , took two frigates with certain Spaniards on the other side of the bay , which came to lade sugar there at and Ingenio . 185
