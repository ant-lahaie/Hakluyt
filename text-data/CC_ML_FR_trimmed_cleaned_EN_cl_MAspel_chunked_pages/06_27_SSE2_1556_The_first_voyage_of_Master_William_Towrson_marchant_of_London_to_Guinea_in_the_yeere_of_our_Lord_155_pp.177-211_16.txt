so we departed , and came aboard , and sent out the other boat to another place , where certain boats that came into the sea , made us signs that there was fresh A Town , water : and being come thither , they found a town , but no river , yet the people brought them fresh water , and showed them and Elephants tooth , making signs that the next day they would sei them teeth , and so they came aboard . This river lies by the Card thirteene leagues from the Cape Das palmas , and there lies to the Westwards of the same a rock about a league in the sea , and the river it self hath a point of land coming out into the Sea , whereupon grow five trees , which may well be discerned two or three leagues off , coming from the Westward , but the river cannot be perceived until such time as a man be hard by it , and then a man may perceive a little Town on each side the river , and to each Town there belongeth a Captain . The river is but small , but the water is good and fresh . Two miles beyond the river , where the other town is , 190 there lies another point into the Sea , which is green like a close , and not above sixe trees upon it , which grow one of them from the other , whereby the coast may well be known : for along all the coast that we have hitherto sailed by , I have not seen so much bore land . In this place , and three or foure leagues to the Westward of it , all along the shore , there grow many Palm trees , whereof they make their wine de Palma . These trees may easily be known almost two leagues off , for they be very high and white bodied , and straight , and be biggest in the midst : they have no boughs , but only a round bush in the top of them
