Remembrances for master S . to give him the better [ II i . 161 . ] occasion to inform himself of some things in England , and after of some other things in Turkey , to the great profit of the Common weal of this Country . Written by the foresaid master Richard Hakluyt , for a principali English Factor at Constantinople 1582 . Ince all men confess ( that be not barbarously bred ) that men are born as well to seek the common commodity of their Country , as their own private benefit , it may seem folly to persuade that point , for each man means so to do . But wherein men should seek the common commodity , and what way , and by what mean that is to be brought about , is the point or sum of the matter , since every good man is ready to employ his labour . This is to be done by and infinite sort of means , as the number of things be infinite that may be done for common benefit of the Realm . And as the chief things so to be done be diverse , so are they to be done by diverse men , as they be by wit and manner of education more fit , or less fit , for this and for that . And for that of many things that tend to the common benefit of the State , some tend more , and some less , I find that no one thing , after one other , is greater then Clothing , and the things incident to the same . And understanding that you are of right good capacity , and become a Factor at Constantinople , and in other parts in Turkey , I find no man fitter of all the English Factors there , then you . And therefore I am so bold to put you in mind , and to tell you wherein with some endeavour you may chance to do your Country much good , and give and infinite sort of the poor people occasion to pray for you here throughout the Realm : this that I mean is in matter of Cloth , etc . 231 1
