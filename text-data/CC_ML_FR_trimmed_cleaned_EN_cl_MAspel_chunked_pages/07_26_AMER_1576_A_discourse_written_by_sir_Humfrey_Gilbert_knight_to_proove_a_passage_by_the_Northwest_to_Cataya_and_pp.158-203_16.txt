to those parts of Europe , because the winds do ( for the most part ) blow there Easterly off from the shore , and the current running that way in like sort , should have driven them Westward upon some part of America : for such winds and tides could never have led them from thence to the said place where they were found , nor yet could they have come from any of the countries aforesaid , keeping the seas always , without skilful mariners 173 This fift reason by later experience is proved utterly untrue . That the Indians could not be natives either of Africa , or of America . to have conducted them such like courses as were necessary to perform such a voyage . 3 Presupposing also , if they had be driven to the West ( as they must have be , coming that way ) then they should have perished , wanting supply of victuals , not having any place ( once leaving the coast of Afrike ) until they came to America , nor from America until they arrived upon some part of Europe , or the Islands adjoining to it , to have refreshed themselves . 4 Also , if ( notwithstanding such impossibilities ) they might have recovered Germanie by coming from India by the Southeast , yet must they without all doubt have stricken upon some other part of Europe before their arrival there , as the Isles of the Azores , Portugal , Spaine , France , England , Ireland , etc . which if they had done , it is not credible that they should or would have departed undiscovered of the inhabitants : but there was never found in those days any such ship or men but only upon the coasts of Germanie , where they have be sundry times and in sundry ages cast aland : neither is it like that they would have committed themselves again to sea , if they had so arrived , not knowing where they were , nor whither to have gone . 5 And by the Southwest it is unpossible ,
