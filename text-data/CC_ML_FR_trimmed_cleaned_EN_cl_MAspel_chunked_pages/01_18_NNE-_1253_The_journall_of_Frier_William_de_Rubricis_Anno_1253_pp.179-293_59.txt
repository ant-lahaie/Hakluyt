Pascatir , was told me by certain Friars predicants , which travailed thither before ever the Tartars came abroad . And from that time they were subdued unto their neighbours the Bulgarians being Saracens , whereupon many of them proved Saracens also . Other matters concerning this people , may be known out of Chronicles . For it is manifest , that those provinces beyond Constantinople , which are now called Bulgaria , Valachia , & Sclavonia , were of old time provinces belonging to the Greeks . Also Hungaria was heretofore called Pannonia . And we were riding over the land of Cangle , from the feast of Holy rood , until the feast of All Saints : travail - country . 279 ing almost every day ( according to mine estimation ) as far , as from Paris to Orleans , and sometime farther , as we were provided of post horses : for some days we had change of horses twice or thrice in a day . Sometime we travailed two or three days together , not finding any people , and then we were constrained not to ride so fast . Of 20 . or 30 . horses we had always the worst , because we were strangers . For every one took their choice of the best horses before us . They provided me always of a strong horse , because I was very corpulent & heavy : but whither he ambled a gentle pace or no , I durst not make any question . Neither yet durst I complain , although he trotted full soar . But every man must be contented with his lot as it fell . Whereupon we were exceedingly troubled : for oftentimes our horses were tired before we could come at any people . And then we were constrained to beat and whip on our horses , and to lay our garments upon other empty horses : yea and sometime two of us to ride upon one horse . Of the hunger , and thirst , and other misery ' s , which we sustained in our journey . Chap . 24 .
