A letter to the right honourable William Hareborne her Majesties Ambassador with the Grand Signior from Alger . Right honourable , we have received your honours letters dated in Constantinople the 5 of November , and accordingly delivered that enclosed to the king of this place , requiring of him , according as you did command us in her Majesties name , that he would vouchsafe to give order to all his Captains & Rajes that none of them should meddle with our English ships coming or going to or from these parts , for that they have order not to pass by the Christian coast , but upon the coast of Barbary , and showing him of the charter given by the Grand Signior , requiring him in like case that for the better fulfilling of the amity , friendship and holy league 263 between the Grand Signior and her Majesty , he would give us five or six safe - conducts for our ships , that meeting with any of his galleys or galliots , they might not meddle with them neither shoot at them : who made me answer he would neither give me any safe conduct nor commission to his men of war not to meddle with them , for that he trusted to take some of them this year , and made good account thereof . In like manner I spoke to the chief of the Janisers and the Levents , who made me answer , the best hope they had this year was to take some of them , and although they have the Grand Signiors commandment we care not therefore : for we will by policy , or one means or other provoke them to shoot some ordinance , which if they do but one piece , the peace is broken , and they be good prizes . And some of them say further , we care not for their safeconduct , for if they show it us , we will convey it away , we are sure the dogs cannot be believed against us . The premises considered , your honour is with all speed to procure the Grand Signior his favourable letters directed to Hazan , the Cady , Captains , Janisers , & Levents , & another like to Romadan Bassa , king of
