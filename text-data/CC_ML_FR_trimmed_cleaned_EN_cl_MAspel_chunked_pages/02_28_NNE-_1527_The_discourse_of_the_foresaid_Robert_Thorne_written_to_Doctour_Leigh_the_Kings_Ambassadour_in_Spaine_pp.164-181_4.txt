longitude , in which are also counted other 360 , is counted from West to East , or from East to West , as in the Carded is set . The said latitude your Lordship may see marked Took ™ ™ the and divided in the end of this Carded on the left hand : iatttudes - so that if you would know in what degrees of latitude any region or coast stands , take a compass , and set the one foot of the same in the Equinoctial line right against the said region , & apply the other foot of the compass to the said region or coast , & then set the said compass at the end of the Carded , where the degrees are divided . And the one foot of the compass standing in the line Equinoctial , the other will show in the scale the degrees of altitude or latitude that the said region is in . Also the longitude of the world I have set out in the neither part of the Carded , containing 167 also 360 degrees : which begin to be counted after Ptoleme and other Cosmographers from and headland called Capo Verde , which is over against a little cross made in the part Occidental , where the division of the degrees begins , and endeth in the same Capo Verde . Now to know in what longitude any land is , your Lordship must take a ruler or a compass , and set the one foot of the compass upon the land or coast whose longitude you would know , and extend the other foot of the compass to the next part of one of the transversali lines in the Orientali or Occidental part : which done , set the one foot of the compass in the said transversal line at the end of the neither scale , the scale of longitude , and the other foot shows the degree of longitude that the region is in . And your Lordship must understand that this Carded , though little , containeth the universali whole world betwixt two collaterali lines , the one in the Occidentali part
