This day we had 95 . fathoms . At three in the afternoon the wind came to the Southwest , we were forced to make our ship fast to a piece of ice , for we were enclosed with it , and tarried the Lords leisure . This night we had 97 . fathoms . The 12 . day the wind was at the Southeast not very much but in a manner calm : at a 11 . of the clock the wind came to the West Southwest : all the day was very dark with snow and fog . At 6 . in the afternoon we set sail the wind being at the North Northeast : all this night we bore away Southwest , and Southsouthwest , as well and as near as the ice would give us leave : all this night we found the ice somewhat favourable to us , more then it was before , whereupon we stood in good hope to get out of it . The 13 . day at 7 . in the morning , the wind was at the Northeast , and Northeast and by East : all this day we were much troubled with the ice , for with a blow against a piece of ice we brake the stock of our anchor , and many other great blows we had against the ice , that it was marvelous that the ship was able to abide them : the side of our boat was broken with our ship which did recoil back , the boat being betwixt a great piece of ice , and the ship , and it perished the head of our rudder . This day was a very hard day with us : at night we found much broken ice , and all this night it blew very much wind , so that we lay in drift with the ice , & our drift was South , for the wind was at North all this night , and we had great store of snow . The 14 . day in the morning we made our ship fist to a piece of ice ,
