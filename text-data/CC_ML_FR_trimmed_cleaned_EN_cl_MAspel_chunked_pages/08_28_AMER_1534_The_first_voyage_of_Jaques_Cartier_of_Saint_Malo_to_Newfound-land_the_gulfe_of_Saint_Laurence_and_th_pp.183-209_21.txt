became so raging that one of our ships lost and anchor , and we were constrained to go up higher into the river seven or eight leagues , into a good harbour and ground that we with our boats found out , and through the evil weather , tempest , and darkness that was , we stayed in the said harbour till the five and twentieth of the month , not being able to put out : in the mean time we saw a great multitude of wild men that were fishing for mackerels , whereof there is great store . Their boats were about 40 , and the persons what with men , women & children two hundred , which after they had haunted our company a while , they came very familiarly with their boats to the sides of our ships . We gave them knives , combes , beads of glass , and other trifles of small valve , for which they made many signs of gladness , lifting their hands up to heaven dancing and singing in their boats . These men may very well and truly be called Wild , because there is no poorer people 201 in the world . For I think all that they had together , beside their boats and nets was not â€™ worth five souse . They go altogether naked saving their privities , which are covered with a little skin , and certain old skins that they cast upon them . Neither in nature nor in language , do they any whit agree with them which we found first : their heads be altogether shaved , except one bush of hair which they suffer to grow upon the top of their crown as long as a horse tail , & then with certain leather strings bind it in a knot upon their heads . They have no other dwelling but their boats , which they turn upside down , and under them they lay themselves all along upon the bore ground . They eat their flesh almost raw , save only that they heat it a little upon embers
