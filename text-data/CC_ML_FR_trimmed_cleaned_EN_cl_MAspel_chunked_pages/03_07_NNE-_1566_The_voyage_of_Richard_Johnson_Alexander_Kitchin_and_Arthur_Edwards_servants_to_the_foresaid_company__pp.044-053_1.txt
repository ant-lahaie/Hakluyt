mercy , who departed this present life the 16 . of March last passed . I wished of God for my part he had lived : for my desire was in his company to have traveled into Persia . Your bark or craer made here for the river of Volga and the Caspian sea is very little , of the burden of 30 . tons at the most . It is handsomely made after the English fashion : but I think it too little for your goods and provision of victuals . If the worshipful company would send hither a Shipwright , being skilful to make one of the burden of 60 . tons or more , drawing but sixe foot water at the most when it is laden , I think it should be profitable . For if your own goods would not lade the same , here be Merchants that would be glad and feign to give great fraught to lade their goods with us , whereby your charges would be much lessened : And so it may happen , the wages of your men hired here may be saved , and your servants and goods in far greater assurance : for their boats here are dangerous to sail with and to pass the Caspian sea . There be Carpenters here that will do well enough having one to instruct them . Your wares bought here , and order taken for those that go for your voyage of Persia are yet unknown unto me : wherefore I cannot ( as I would at this present ) write to you thereof . Yet , ( as you do know ) it was the Governors mind I should be acquainted with greater affairs then these . Howbeit I doubt not but I shall be informed of them A bark of thy . tons made at Jeraslave to pass the Caspian seas . that are appointed , and all things shall be bought when they shall see time and have more laisure . Thus in haste ( as appears ) I commit you and yours into the hands of almighty God ; who preserve you in perfect health with increase of worship . From Jeraslave the
