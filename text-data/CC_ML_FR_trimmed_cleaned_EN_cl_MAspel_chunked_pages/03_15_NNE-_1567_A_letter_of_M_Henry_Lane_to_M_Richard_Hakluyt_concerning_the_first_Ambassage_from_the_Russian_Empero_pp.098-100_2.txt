and commission from the Company , I was in the Low country at Antwerpe and Amsterdam , and sometime in company with Polacks , Danskers , and Easterlings : and by reason I had be a lidger in Russia , I could the better reply and prove , that their own nations and the Italians were most guilty of the accusations written by the king of Poland . This king Sigismundus ( whose ambassadors very sumptuous I have seen at Mosco ) was reported to be too mild in suffering the Moscovites . Before our traffic they overran his great dukedom of Lituania , Smolensk wone and took Smolensco , carrying the people captives to by the Russe . Mosco . And in the year 1563 , as appears by Thomas Alcocks letter , they suffered the Russe likewise in that Polotzko Duchy to take a principali city called Polotzko , with taken . the iorj and ( j peOple thereof . Likewise the said Sigis - mundus and the king of Sweden did not look to the protection of Livonia , but lost all , except Rye and Revel , and the Russe made the Narve his port to traffic , not only to us , but to Lubec and others , general . And still from those parts the Moscovites were furnished out of Dutchland by enterlopers with all arts and artificers , and had few or none by us . The Italians also furnished them with engines of war , and taught them warlike stratagems , and the art of fortification . In the days of Sigismund , the Russe would tant the Polacks , that they loved their ease at home with their wives , and to drink , and were not at commandment of their king . This Sigismund had to wife the daughter of Ferdinando , Charles the fifths brother , and he died without issue . Polotzko re - Since which time their late elected king Stephanus Batore tiered by tO Russe jn better order , and recovered Polotzko Batore . again in the year 1579 . Thus with my hearty farewell I take my leave of your worship . Your assured friend Henrie Lane .
