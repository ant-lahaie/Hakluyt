a place called Staryts , three score miles from the said Otwer . Then I sent my Interpretor to the chief Secretary , requesting him to further , and show his favour unto our said merchant ' s in their suits , which they should have occasion to move in my absence : who sent me word again , that they should be well assured of his friendship , and furtherance in all their suits . And forthwith post horses were sent me , with a Gentleman to conduct me . And so departing from the said Sloboda , I arrived at the said Otwer , the 28 . of March aforesaid , 179 where I remained till the eight of May following . Then I was sent for to come unto his Majesty , to the said Staryts , where I arrived the tenth of the same , and the twelfth of the same I was appointed to come to the chief Secretary , who at our meeting said unto me these words . Our Lord Emperor , and great Duke , hath not only perused the Queen her highness letters sent by you , and thereby doth perceive her mind , as well touching their princely affairs , as also her earnest request in the merchant ' s behalf , but also hath well pondered your words . And therefore his Majesties pleasure is , that you let me understand what suits you have to move in the merchant ' s behalf , or otherwise , for that to morrow you shall have access again unto his highness , and shall have full answer in all things , with your dispatch away . Then after long conference had with him of diverse matters I gave him in writing certain brief articles of requests , which I had drawn out ready , as followeth : i First the Queens Majesty her request is , that it would please the Emperor ' s highness to let me know the just cause of his great displeasure fallen upon sir William Garrard , & his company , who never deserved the same , to their knowledge . 2 Also
