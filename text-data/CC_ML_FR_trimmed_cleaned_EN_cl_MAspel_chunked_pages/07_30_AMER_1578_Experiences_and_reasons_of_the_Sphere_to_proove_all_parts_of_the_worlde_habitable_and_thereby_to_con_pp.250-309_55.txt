the bones , he made signs to the contrary , and that he was slain with Wolves and wild beasts . Here also was found hid under stones good store of fish , and sundry other things of the inhabitants ; as sleds , bridles , kettles of fish - skinnes , knives of bone , and such other like . And our Savage declared unto us the use of all those things . And taking in his hand one of those country bridles , he caught one of our dogs and hampered him handsomely therein , as we do our horses , and with a whip in his hand , he taught the dog to draw in a sled as we do horses in a coach , setting himself thereupon like a guide : so that we might see they use dogs for that purpose that we do our horses . And we found since by experience , that the lesser sort of dogs they feed fat , and keep them as domestical cattle in their tents for their eating , and the greater sort serve for the use of drawing their sleds . The twentie ninth of July , about five leagues from Bears found , we discovered a Bay which being fenced on each side with small Hands lying off the main , which break the force of the tides , and make the place free from any indrafts of ice , did prove a very fit harbour for our ships , where we came to anchor under a small Island , which now together with the found is called by the name of that right Honourable and virtuous Lady , Anne Countess of Warwicke . And this is the furthest place that this year we have entered up 299 Bears found . Lecesters Hand . A tomb with a dead men bones in it . Bridles , knives , and other instruments found hid among the Rocks . They use great dogs to draw sleds , and title dogs for their meat . Thirty leagues discovered within the straits .
