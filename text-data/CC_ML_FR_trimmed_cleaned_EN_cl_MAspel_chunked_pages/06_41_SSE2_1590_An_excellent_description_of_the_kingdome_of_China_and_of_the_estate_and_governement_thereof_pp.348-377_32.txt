( said City of Xauquin : in which thing verily they used great moderation , not any way offending or exasperating the minds of the father ' s , but only signifying that they had regard unto the estate of their Commonwealth . For the Tutan or Viceroy calling the father ' s unto him , and ( to let pass other accidents ) using courteous and familiar conference with them , declared by many arguments , that their habitation in the City of Xauquin was not convenient , especially since so many Magistrates resorted unto that City , who would take great offence at the presence of strangers . For the which cause he persuaded them to accept some part of the money which they had bestowed in the building of their house , and so to return either home into their own country , or unto the port of Macao . Howbeit , such was the instant supplication of the father ' s , and so worthy of compassion , that the Tutan or Viceroy , in the extreme and mediterrane borders of the province of Coantum , assigned unto them a new habitation at the city called Xaucheo , commending them also to a certain Magistrate , who was come from the same place to salute him . Thither therefore the said father ' s , not without great sorrow and grief of the Christians , hied themselves , and as we are informed by 376 their last letters , they have even now laid the foundation of their first building , and have also written that they are like to live much more peaceably and conveniently for the propagating of Christian religion . These be the first beginnings of Christianity in China , where , even as in other places of the Christian Commonwealth , the seed is to be sown with , great labour and tears , that acceptable fruits may be reaped with gladness . Leo . It is even as you have said ( Michael ) and now for this your pleasant and eloquent discourse we do acknowledge our selves much bounden unto you .
