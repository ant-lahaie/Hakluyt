Over against this point of the Ycacos , in the Isle of Cares , hard by the water side , there are great store of stones , free stones , and other stones to make lime , and wood to burn the stones withal for the lime , and great part of the stones do lie about the water : so the wood will cost but the cutting of it down , and the working of it , and with little pains taking it will be brought to good perfection , for we have already made trial thereof , for there was never building that went to decay after it hath be made , nor perished by the sea : so the charge hereof will be but little or nothing . And for to put this in practice to built a fort , it is needful that your majesty should send hither and to many other places , where any fort shall be made , some store of Negroes , and to this place would be sent 150 Negroes brought from Guyney : and if the Negroes of Havana are not to be employed there , nor those which are in Sant Juan de Ullua , it may please your majesty to cause them to be sent for to this place , for most of them be artificers , some masons , bricklayers , smith ' s and sawyers , and to send some masons from Spaine to teach our men
