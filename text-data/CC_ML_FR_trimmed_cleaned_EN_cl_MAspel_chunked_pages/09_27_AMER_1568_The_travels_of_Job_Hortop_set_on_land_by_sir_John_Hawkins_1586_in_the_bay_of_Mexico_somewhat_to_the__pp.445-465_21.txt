therefore , said he , I will have you the Captains , Master ' s , and Pilots , to set your hands unto that , for I swear by the king that I will hang them , Diego Flores de Valdes answered , I nor the Captains , Master ' s , and Pilots will not set our hands to that , for he said , if he had been prisoner as we were , he would have done the like himself . He counseled him to keep us fast in prison , till he came into Spaine , & then send us to the Contratation house in Sivil , where , if we had deserved death the law would pass on us , for he would not have it said that in such a fleet as that was , sixe men and a boy should take the pinnace , and go away , and so he returned to his ship again . When he was gone , the general came to the main mast to us , and swore by the king , that we should not come out of the stocks till we came into Spaine : within 462 16 days after we came over the bar of S . Lucar , and came up to the Hurcados , then he put us into a pinnace in the stocks , and sent us prisoners to the Contratation house in Sivill . From thence after one year we brake prison , on S . Stevens day at night , 7 . of our company escaped , Robert Barret , I Job Hortop , John Emerie , Humphrey Roberts , and John Gilbert were taken , and brought back to the contratation house , where we remained in the stocks till twelfe tide was passed . Then our keeper put up a petition to the Judge of the contratation house , that we might be sent to the great prison house in Sivill , for that we broke prison , whereupon we were presently led thither , where we remained one month , and then from thence , to the castle of the Inquisition
