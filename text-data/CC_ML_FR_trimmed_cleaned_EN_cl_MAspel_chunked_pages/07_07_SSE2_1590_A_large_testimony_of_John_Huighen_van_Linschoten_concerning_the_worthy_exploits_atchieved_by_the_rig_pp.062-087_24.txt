altogether out of order , and broken , and many of their men hurt , whereby they were compelled to come into the Island of Tercera , there to repair themselves : where being arrived , I and my chamber - fellow , to hear some news , went aboard one of the ships being a great Biscain , and one of the 12 Apostles , whose captain was called Bartandono , that had been General of the Biscains in the fleet that went for England . He seeing us called us up into the gallery , where with great courtesy he received us , being as then set at dinner with the English captain that sat by him , and had on a suit of black velvet , but he could not tell us any thing , for that he could speak no other language but English and Latin , which Bartandono also could a little speak . The English captain god licence of the governor that he might come on land with his weapon by his side , and was in our lodging with the Englishman that was kept prisoner in the Hand , being of that ship whereof the sailors god away , as I said before . The governor of Tercera bade him to dinner , and showed him great courtesy . The master likewise with licence of Bartandono came on land and was in our lodging , and had at the least io or 12 wounds , as well in his head as on his body , whereof after that being at sea between Lisbon & the Hands he died . The captain wrote a letter , wherein he declared all the manner of the fight , and left it with the English merchant that lay in our lodging , to send it to the lord Admiral of England . This English captain coming unto Lisbon , was there well received and not any hurt done unto him , but with good convoy sent to Setuval , and from thence sailed into England with all the rest of the Englishmen that were taken prisoners .
