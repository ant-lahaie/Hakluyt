sometime falls high , sometime low in the year called in their tongue Ramazan , and their feast is called Bairam . During this time of lent all they which intend to go unto Mecca resort unto Cairo , because that twentie days after the feast the Carovan is ready to depart on the voyage : and thither resort a great multitude of people from Asia , Grecia , and Barbaria to go on this voyage , some moved by devotion , and some for traffics sake , and some to pass away the time . Now within few days after the feast they which go on the voyage depart out of the city two leagues unto a place called Birca , where they expect the Captain of the Carovan . This place hath a great pond caused by the inundation of Nilus , and so made , that the camels and other beasts may drink therein : whereof , namely , of Mules , Camels , and Dromedaries there are at least fortie thousand , and the persons which follow the Carovan every year are about fiftie thousand , 340 few more or less , according to the times . Moreover every three years they renew the Captain of the Carovan , called in the Arabian tongue Amarilla Haggi , that is , the Captain of the Pilgrimss , to whom the Grand Signior gives every voyage eighteene purses , containing each of them sixe hundred twentie and five ducats of gold , and these be for the behoof of the Carovan , and also to do alms unto the needful pilgrimss . This Captain , beside other servingmen which follow him , hath also foure Chausi to serve him . Likewise he hath with him for the security of the Carovan foure hundred soldiers , to wit , two hundred Spachi or horsemen mounted on Dromedaries , and two hundred Janizaries riding upon Camels . The Chausi and the Spachi are at the charge of the Captain , but the Janizaries not so , for their provision is made them from Cairo . The Spachi wear caps or bonnets like to the caps of Sergeants
