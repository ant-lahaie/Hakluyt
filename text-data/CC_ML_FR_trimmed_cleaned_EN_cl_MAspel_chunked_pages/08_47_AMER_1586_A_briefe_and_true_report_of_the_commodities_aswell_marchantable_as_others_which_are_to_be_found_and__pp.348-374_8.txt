ordinarily in time before . Civet - cats . In our travels there was found one to have been killed by a Savage or inhabitant , & in another place the smel where one or more had lately be before , whereby we gather , beside then by the relation of the people , that there are some in the country : good profit will rise by them . Iron . In two places of the country specially , one about fourescore , & the other six score miles from the fort or place where we dwelled , we found never the water side the ground to be rocky , which by the trial of a Minerali man was found to hold iron richly . It is found in many places of the country else : I know nothing to the contrary , but that it may be allowed for a good merchantable commodity , considering there the small charge for the labour & feeding of men , the infinite store of wood , the want of wood & deerenesse thereof in England , and the necessity of ballasting of ships . Copper . And hundred and fifty miles into the main in two towns we found with the inhabitants diverse small plataeae of Copper , that had be made as we understood by the inhabitants that dwell further into the country , where as they say are mountains and rivers that yield also white grains of mettle , which is to be deemed Silver . For confirmation whereof , at the time of our first arrival in the country , I saw , with some others with me , two small pieces of Silver grossly beaten , about the weight of a testron , hanging in the ears of a 356 Wiroans or chief lord that dwelled about fourescore miles from us : of whom through inquiry , by the number of days and the way , I learned that it had come to his hands from the same place or near , where I after understood the Copper was made , and the white grains of metal found . The aforesaid Copper we also found by trial to hold Silver .
