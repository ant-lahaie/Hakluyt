sold there for one bisse the Teveris batman . In these parts be many Turkey merchant ' s resident , The malice of which give and outward show , as though they were glad of our coming hither , but secretly they be our mortali enemies , searching by all means to hinder our sales , because we should the sooner give over our trade thither , which in process of time I hope will grow to better perfection . They wish us to go to Hallape with the 141 rest of our commodities unsold , where they say we shall have good entertainment in spite of the great number of Venetians which be there resident , and the custom but two in the hundred , and our karsies to be sold presently , had we never so many , for twelve ducats , which makes of this money 165 . shaughs : but by such as know the place , market and custom , it is reported to us credibly to the contrary , and that such karsies as ours be , are not sold for above 8 . ducats there : the custom thirtie in the hundred and more , that no place in the world is so well furnished with good cloth and karsies , and of so brave colour as that place is , supposing it to be craftily purposed of them , to bring us into trouble , which God defend us from . The price of spices be these , at this present enhanced by reason you way is shut to Ormus , which when God shall send open , I purpose ( God willing ) to see , and at my return to advertise the worshipful what benefit is there to be had in all points , so near as I can learn : Pepper 25 . shaughs the Teveris batman : Cloves 50 . shaughs , Long pepper 25 . shaughs , Maces large 50 . shaughs , Ginger 24 . shaughs , ready money all , or else look not upon them . And the best sort of raw silk is sold for 60 . shaughs the Teveris batman . Thus for want of further matter to enlarge , I end for this time , beseeching God to preserve you in continual ! health . By your obedient servant , Lawrence Chapman .
