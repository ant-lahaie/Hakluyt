woman or child , upon pain of death : And so permitting the spoil of so much of the town as was by them thought meet , to the common soldiers for some certain days , they were continually in counsel about other grave directions , best known to their honourable wisdoms . This honourable and merciful Edict I am sure was streightly and religiously observed of the English : But how well it was kept by the Dutch , I will neither affirm , nor yet deny . For I perceive between them and the Spaniards there is and implacable heartburning , and therefore as soon as the Dutch squadron was espied in the fight , immediately thereupon both they of Sivil and S . Lucar and also some of some other places did not only arrest all such Dutch ships , as dealt with them friendly 253 by the way of traffic & Merchandise , and so confiscated their goods , but also imprisoned the Merchants and Owners of the same , and , as the report goes , did entreat many of them with extreme cruelty thereupon . In the mean while the very next day being the two and twenty day of June , all the Spanish ships which were left on ground in the Bay of Cadiz , where the great overthrow had been but the day before , were by the Spaniards themselves there set on fire , and so from that time forward they never left burning of them , till every one of them , goods and all , as far as we know were burned and consumed . This their doing was much marveled at of us , and so much the more , for that , as I said before , there had be made some offer for the redemption and saving of the goods , and it was not to them unknown that this their offer was not misliked , but in all probability should have be accepted . The common opinion was , that this was done either by the appointment of the Duke de Medina Sidonia , or else by express commandment from the higher powers .
