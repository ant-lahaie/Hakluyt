Christian princes in time , that they do not betray their dignity , liberty and life of them and their subject ' s to a most barbarous and cruel enemy , as we can no less doe by the duty of a Christian prince . For now we do foresee , except other princes take this admonition , the Moscovite puffed up in pride with those things that be brought to the Narve , and made more perfect in warlike affairs with engines of war and ships , will make assault this way on Christendome , to slay or make bound all that shall withstand him : which God defend . With 486 which our admonition diverse princes already content themselves , and abstain from the Narve . The others that will not abstain from the said voyage shall impeached by our navy , and incur the danger of loss of life , liberty , wife and children . Now therefore if the subject ' s of your Majesty will forbear this voyage to Narve , there shall nothing denied to them of us . Let your Majesty well weigh and consider the reasons & occasions of our stopping of ships going to the Narve . In which stopping , our subject ' s of Dansk be in no fault , as we have already written to your Majesty , neither use we their counsel in the same . In any other matter , if there be any fault in them against your Majesty or your subject ' s , we will gladly do justice upon them , that your Majesty may well understand that we be careful of you and your subject ' s . Neither think we it meet to take Hamburgh , or any other place to judge the matter : for we have our council & judgement seat at Rye , where your Majesty & your subject ' s , or any other , shall have justice administered unto them , with whom we have had ancient league and amity . And thus much we have thought good to let your Majesty understand . Fare you well . Dated the sixt of December the 39 of our reign . Sigismundus Augustus Rex .
