for the same . I assure you there is in those parts to be had three or foure thousand horses lading , every horse load being 50 . or 60 . batmans , beside silk of Grosin . Great abundance of silk at times is sent out of these parts , to wit , 4 . or 5 . hundred horse loads at a time by the Turkes , who bring great store of silver to be coined , to wit , Dollars at ten shaughs the piece . The Hungarie Ducket is at 12 . shaughs . And having money in readiness at the time of the year , they buy silk the better cheap , when the country men bring it first to be sold . If your worships may bargain with the Venetians to take silk at your hands , or otherwise deal with them , I do not mistrust but to have at the Shaughs hand sixe batmans of silk for two pieces and a half of karsies . Your good advice herein , and in other matters , I trust you will write with convenient speed . Master Anthonie M . Anthonie Jenkinson hath deserved great commendation at all your Jenkinson worships hands : for the good report of his well and come e • wise doings in those parts , was oftentimes a comfort to me to hear thereof , and some good help to me in my proceedings . To this day I never herd from any of our merchant ' s . God grant me in health to see your worships , for I have had a careful travel , with many a sorrowful day and unquiet sleeps . Neither had I the company of one English person , to whom sometime I might have eased my pensive heart , as God well knoweth , who hath delivered me from mine enemies . Thus almighty God grant you in health and wealth long to live . Your humble servant at commandment during life , Arthur Edwards . 63 under - Shaugh , M .
