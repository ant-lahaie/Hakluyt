at the small end , And Arshine is and for the other that were provided the last year , 3 - quarters of I trust they shall be sent down in the spring : of the a ^ ard , ir year . And as concerning the Ropemakers , you shall understand that their abiding place shall be with you at A rope house Colmogro , as I do think Master Grey hath advertised erected at you . For , as Roger Bon tinge Master of the works c Â° lmogro . doth say , there is no place more meet for their purpose then with you : and there it will be made with lesser cost , considering that the pale is the one half of it : which is to set one pale more to that , and so for to cover it over , which as they say , will be but little cost . They do pray that it may be made sixteen foot broad , and one hundred and eightie fathoms long : and that in the mid way twentie foot from the pale toward the water side there may be a house made to tar in , standing alone by it self A tar house . for danger of fire . The Tar house that they would have made , is to be fifteene fathoms long , and ten fathoms broad , and they would that house should be made first : for I think they will not tar before they come there . And farther they desire that you will provide for as much tar as you may , for here we have small store , but when the time comes that it 393 should be made , I will provide as much as I can here , that it may be sent down when the Nasade comes . The stuff that they have ready spun is about five thousand weight , and they say that they trust to have by that time they come down yarn enough to make 20 . cables . As concerning a copy of the Alphabet in Robert ciphers Master Grey hath written hither that Robert Austen . Austen had one , which he willed that he should deliver to you . Thus I surcease , beseeching God to preserve you in health , and to send you your hearts desire . By yours to command to his power , Thomas Hawtrey .
