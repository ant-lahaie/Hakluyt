. For the residue of the points of your Majesties letters concerning the entertainment of our ambassador , and proceeding in the cause of Anthonie Marsh we hold our self satisfied with your princely answer , and do therein note and honourable and princely care in your Majesty to prevent the like troubles , controversies and suits , that Marshes cause stirred up between our merchant ' s and your subject ' s , which is , that your Majesty doth purpose from time to time to purge your Country of such stragglers of our subject ' s , as doe or shall hereafter abide there , and are not of the Company of our merchant ' s , but contemptuously depart out of our land without our Highness licence : of which sort there are presented unto us from our merchant ' s the names of these several persons , videlicet , Richard Cocks , Bennet Jackman , Rainold Kitchen , Simon Rogers , Michael Lane , Thomas Worsenham : whom it may please your Majesty by your princely order to dismiss out of your land , that they may be sent home in the next ships , to avoid the mislike which their residence in those parts might breed to the disturbance of our brotherly league , and the impeaching of the intercourse . And whereas , most loving and dearest brother , one William Turnebull a subject of ours is lately deceased in your kingdom , one with whom our merchant ' s have had much controversy for great sums of money due unto them by him while he was their Agent in their affairs of merchandises : which differences by arbitrable order were reduced to the sum of 3000 rubbles , and so much should have been paid by him as may appear by your Majesties council or magistrates of justice by very credible information and testimony : and whereas also the said Turnbull was further indebted by bills of his own hand to diverse of our subject ' s , amounting in the whole , to the sum of 1326 pounds , which bills are exemplified under our great seal of England
