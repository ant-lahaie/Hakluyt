which Or the straits navigation to the said straits is 1700 . or 1800 leagues ; DfMaSelane - and from these Straits being passed them , they return toward the line Equinoctial to the Islands of Spicery , which are distant from the said Straits 4200 . or 4300 . leagues . The navigation of the Portingals to the said Islands is departing from Portingall Southward toward the Cape Verde , and from thence to another Cape passing the line Equinoctial called Capo de bona speransa , and from Portingal to the Cape is 1800 leagues , and from this Cape to the Islands of Spicery of the Emperor is 2500 . leagues . So that this navigation amounteth all to 4300 . leagues .

And though we went not to the said Islands , for that Note . they are the Emperors or kings of Portingal , we should by the way and coming once to the line Equinoctial , find lands no less rich of gold and Spicery , as all other lands are under the said line Equinoctial : and also should , if we may pass under the North , enjoy the navigation of all Tartarie .

And hitherto they had all the like opinion , that under the line
