Woad : a thing of so great vent and uses among English Dyers , which can not be yielded sufficiently in our own country for spare of ground , may be planted in Virginia , there being ground enough . The growth thereof need not to be doubted , when as in the Islands of the Azores it grows plentifully , which are in the same climate . So likewise of Madder .
