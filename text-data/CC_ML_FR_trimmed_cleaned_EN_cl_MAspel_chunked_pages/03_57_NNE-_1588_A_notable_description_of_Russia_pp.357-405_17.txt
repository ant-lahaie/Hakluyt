Whereupon advising what was best to be done , they agreed all to set upon them with no other show of weapon but with their horse whips ( which as their manner is every man rides withal ) to put them in remembrance of their servile condition , thereby to terrify them , & abate their courage . And so marching on & lashing all together with their whips in their hands they gave the onset . Which seemed so terrible in the ears of their villains , and stroke such a sense into them of the smart of the whip which they had felt before , that they fled altogether like sheep before the drivers .
