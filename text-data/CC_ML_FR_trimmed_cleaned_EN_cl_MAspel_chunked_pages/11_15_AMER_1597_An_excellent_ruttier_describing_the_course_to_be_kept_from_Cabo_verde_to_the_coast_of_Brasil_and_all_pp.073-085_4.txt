hill along the sea : And if thou be nigh the land , and cannot make it certain what land it is : thou shalt mark if it be a round high hill The distance along the sea , that it is O morro de San Paulo , or , The Paulo hill Saint P ^ l : and it lies black and bore on the from Bahia . top . And from thence to Bahia is tenne leagues . And here along this hill on the Northwest side Pio de Tin - there is a great river called Tinsare : and it is a very sare a very gOOd river . And in the entrance of Bahia there are â€™ sixe or seven fathoms water in the channel . And I advice thee that being in the height of 13 degrees and a half , thou come not near the land , for it hath a bay very dangerous . And if thou go from Bahia to Fernambuck , then I advice thee that thou take good heed of the coast on the Northeast and Southwest , and thou shalt go East , if the wind will suffer thee to go East : and so go thirtie or forty leagues off to the sea . I advice thee that thou bear not in with the land of Fernambuck , but in the height of 9 or 10 degrees , because that in 11 degrees thou shalt fallen with the bay called A Enseada de Vazabaris . Also if thou come from Portugal and fallest with the land in eleven degrees , bear not in with it , neither come near it , for thou mayest hurt thy self in so doing : but thou shalt shun it , and go to the Southward . For if thou lie to the North thou shalt bring thy self into some trouble . This Bay of All Saints stands in thirteene degrees . And from thence to Fernambuck thou hast a hundreth leagues : and the coast lies Northeast and Southwest . And from thence to Rio das Ilhas , that is , the river of the Islands the coast runneth Northeast and Southwest
