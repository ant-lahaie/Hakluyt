that as my errors were great , so they have yielded very grievous effects , & if ought might have be deserved in former times to have counterpoised any part of offences , the fruit thereof ( as it seems ) was long before fallen from the tree , & the dead stock only remained . I did therefore even in the winter of my life , undertake these travels , fitter for bodies less blasted with misfortunes , for men of greater ability , and for minds of better encouragement , that thereby , if it were possible , I might recover but the moderation of excess , & the least taste of the greatest plenty formerly possessed . If I had known other way to win , if I had imagined how greater adventures might have regained , if I could conceive what farther means I might yet use , but even to appease so powreful displeasure , I would not doubt but for one year more to hold fast my soul in my teeth , till it were performed . Of that title remain I had , I have wasted in effect all herein . I have undergone many constructions .

They have grossly belied me , that forejudged , that I would rather become a servant to the Spanish king , then return , and the rest were much mistaken , who would have persuaded , that I was too easeful and sensuali to undertake a journey of so great travel . But , if what I have done , receive the gracious construction of a 339 painful pilgrimage , and purchase the least remission , I shall think all too little , & that there were wanting to the rest many misery ' s . But if both the times past , the present , and what may be in the future , do all by one grain of gall continue in eternal distaste ; I do not then know whither I should bewail my self , either for my too much travel and expense , or condemn my self
