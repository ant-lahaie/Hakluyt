of these great Clerks : that we may not let pass such a notable commendation of Island . Krantzius and Munster have hitherto taught , that the Islanders are Christians . Also : that before the receiving of Christian faith they lived according to the law of nature . Also : that the Islanders lived after a law not much differing from the law of the Germane . Also , that they lived in holy simplicity . Attend I say ( good Reader ) and consider , what marks of Christianitie , of the law of nature , of the Germane law , of holy simplicity , these authors require , and what marks they show and describe in the Islanders . There was one of the said marks before : namely , that the Islanders do place hell or the prison of the damned , within the gulf and bottom of mount Hecla : concerning which , read the first section of this part , and the seventh section of the former . The seconde mark is , that with the Anabaptists they take away distinctions of properties and possessions : in the section next going before . The third and most excellent is this : those singular & natural affections , that love and tender care , and that fatherly and godly mind of the Islanders towards their children , namely that they make the same account of them , or less then they do of their dogs . What ? Will Munster and Krantzius after this fashion picture out unto us the law of Christ , the law of nature , the law of the Germane , and holy simplicity ? O rare and excellent picture , though not altogether matching the skill of Apelles : Oh sharp and wonderful invention , if authentical : Oh knowledge more then humane , though not at all divine . But we Islanders ( albeit the farthest of all nations and inhabiting a frozen climb ) require far other notes of Christianitie . For we have the commandment of God , that every man should love his neighbour as himself .
