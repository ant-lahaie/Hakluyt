They for their parts , although they could have wished a quiet voyage and journey without blows and violence , yet not willing to be spoiled with such Barbarians as they were , began to defend themselves against their assault , by means whereof a very terrible & fierce fight followed and continued hight & sharp for two hours , wherein our men so well played their parts with their calivers , that they forced the Tartars to flee with the loss of 120 . of them , as they were afterwards informed by a Russe prisoner , which escaped from the Nagaians , and came to them to Astracan , at which town they arrived the 20 . of August . In this town of Astracan they were somewhat hindered of their journey , and stayed the space of sixe weeks 150 by reason of a great army of 70000 . Turkes and Tartars
