it did for the time thoroughly ( as it seemed ) change him in disposition towards us : Insomuch as forthwith Ensenore won this resolution of him , that out of hand he should go about , and withal , to cause his men to set up wears forthwith for us : both which he at that present went in hand withal , and did so labour the expedition of it , that in the end of April he had sowed a good quantity of ground , so much as had be sufficient , to have fed our whole company ( God blessing the grouth ) and that by the belly , for a whole year : beside that he gave us a certain plot of ground for our selves to sow . All which put us in marvelous comfort , if we could pass from Aprill until the beginning of July , ( which was to have be the beginning of their harvest , ) that then a new supply out of England or else our own store would well enough maintain us : All our fear was of the two months betwixt , in which mean space if the Savages should not help us with Cassavi , and Chyna , arid that our wears should fail us , ( as often they did , ) we might very well starve , notwithstanding the growing corn , like the starving horse in the stable , with the growing grass , as the proverb is : which we very hardly had escaped but only by the hand of God , as it pleased him to try us .
