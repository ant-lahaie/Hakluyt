Cneius Pompeius laid siege thereunto ( Valerius lib . 7 . cap . 7 . ) the citizens whereof converted their wives and children into meat for the satisfying of their extreme hunger , whom doubtless they would with all their hearts have sold for other victuals . That famine also is well known which in the year of our Lord 851 ( Vincent , lib . 25 . cap . 26 . ) afflicted Germany , insomuch that the father was glad to devour his own son . It is well known after the death of the Emperor Henry the seventh , in a famine continuing three whole years , how the parents would devour their children , and the children their parents , and that especially in Polonia and Bohemia . And that we may not only allege ancient examples : it is reported that there was such a grievous dearth of corn in the years 1586 , and 1587 , throughout Hungary , that some being compelled for want of food were feign to fell their children unto the most bloody and barbarous enemy of Christians , and so to enthral them to the perpetuali yoke of Turkish slavery : and some are said to have taken their children , whom they could no longer 176 1592 . sustain , and with cruel mercy to have cast them into Danubius , and drowned them . But should these stories and the like make any man so mad as to affirm that this or that nation accustometh to kill their children for their own food , and to fell them willingly unto the Turks , or to drown and strangle them willingly in the water ? I cannot think it . So neither ( because beggars in Island being inforced through extreme and biting necessity , do willingly part with their sons ) is this custom generally to be imputed unto the whole nation , and that by way of disgrace , by any man , except it be such and one who hath taken his leave of all modesty , plain dealing , humanity , and truth .
