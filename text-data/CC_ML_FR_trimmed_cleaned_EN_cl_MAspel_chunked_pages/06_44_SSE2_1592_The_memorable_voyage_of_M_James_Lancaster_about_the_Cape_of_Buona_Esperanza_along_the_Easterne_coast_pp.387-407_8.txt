thunderclap . A Junco laden with pepper and drugs . The currents set to the Northwards . Zocotora . died , which might have be cured by letting of blood before it had been settled . Before our departure we had in this place some thousand weight of pitch , or rather a kind of grey and white gum like unto frankincense , as clammy as turpentine , which in melting grows as black as pitch , and is very brittle of it self , but we mingled it with oil , whereof we had 30 Â° jars in the prize which we took to the Northward of the Equinoctial , not far from Guinie , bound for Brasil . Sixe days before we departed hence , the Cape merchant of the Factory wrote a letter unto our captain in the way of friendship , as he pretended , requesting a jar of wine , and a jar of oil , and two or three pounds of gunpowder , which letter he sent by a Negro his man , and More in a Canoa : we sent him his demands by the More , but took the Negro along with us because we understood he had be in the East Indies and knew somewhat of the country . By this Negro we were advertised of a small Bark of some thirtie tons ( which the Moors call a Junco ) which was come from Goa thither laden with Pepper for the Factory and service of that kingdom . Thus having trimmed our ship as we lay in this road , in the end we set forward for the coast of the East India , the 15 of February aforesaid , intending if we could to have reached to Cape Comori , which is the headland or Promontory of the main of Malavar , and there to have lain off and on for such ships as should have passed from Zeilan , Sant Tome , Bengala , Pegu , Malacca , the Moluccos , the coast of China , and the He of Japan , which ships are of exceeding wealth and riches
