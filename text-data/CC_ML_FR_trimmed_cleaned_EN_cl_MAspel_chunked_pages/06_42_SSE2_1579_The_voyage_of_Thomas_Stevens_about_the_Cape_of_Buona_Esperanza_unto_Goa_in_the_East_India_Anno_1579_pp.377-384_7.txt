though they had be sodden : but this was no sign of land . After , about the eleventh degree , the space of many days , more then ten thousand fish by estimation followed round about our ship , whereof we caught so many , that for fifteene days we did eat nothing else , and they served our turn very well : for at this time we had neither meat nor almost any thing else to eat , our navigation growing so long that it drew near to seven months , where as commonly they go it 3 ^ 3 A .

These running seas be so perilous that they deceive the most part of the governors , and some be so little curious , contenting themselves with ordinary experience , that they care not to seek out any means to know when they swerve , neither by the compass
