after we had thus communed , I caused 4 or 5 of them to go into my cabin , where I gave them figs , and made them such cheer as I could . While I was thus banqueting of them , there came another of their skifFes aboard with one who was a Keril , whose name afterwards I learned , & that he dwelled in Colmogro , & Gabriel dwelled in the town of Cola , which is not far from the rivers mouth . This foresaid Keril said unto me that one of the anchors which I borrowed was his , I gave him thanks for the lone of it , thinking it had be suffi - cient . And as I continued in one accustomed manner , that if the present which they brought were worth entertainment , they had it accordingly , he brought nothing with him , & therefore I regarded him but little . And thus we ended , & they took their leave 330 and went a shore . At their coming ashore , Gabriel and Keril were at unconvenient words , and by the ears , as I understand : the cause was because the one had better entertainment then the other : but you shall understand that Gabriel was not able to make his party good , because there were 17 lodias of the Kerils company who took his part , and but 2 of Gabriels company . The next high water Gabriel and his company departed from thence , and rowed to their former company and neighbours , which were in number 28 at the least , and all of them belonging to the river Cola . Twentie eight Lodias belonging to Cola . And as I understood Keril made reckoning that the 27 hawser which was fast in his anchor should have be his own , and at first would not deliver it to our boat , insomuch that I sent him word that I would complain upon him , whereupon he delivered the hawser to my company . The next day being Saturday , I sent our boat on shore to fetch fresh water and wood ,
