marching towards the chief place of habitation in this Island ( as by the Portugall we were informed ) having travailed to the mountains the space of three miles , and arriving there somewhat before the day break , we arrested our selves to see day before us , which appearing , we found the inhabitants to be fled : but the place , by reason that it was manured , we found to be more fruitful then the other part , especially the valleys among the hills .
