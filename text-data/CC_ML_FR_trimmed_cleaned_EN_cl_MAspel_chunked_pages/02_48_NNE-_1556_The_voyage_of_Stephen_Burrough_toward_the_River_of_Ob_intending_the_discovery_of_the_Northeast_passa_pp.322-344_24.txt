up , and then we might see the land seven or eight leagues to the Eastwards of Caninoz : we sounded a little before and had 35 . fathoms and oz . And a while after we sounded again , and had 19 . fathom and sand : then we were within three leagues and a half of the shore , and towards night there came down so much wind , that we were 343 feign to bring our ship a try , and laid her head to the Westwards . 3 Â° Sunday , the wind became more calm , and then it waxed very mystie : At noon we cast about to the Eastwards , the wind being at South , and ran eight hours on that board , and then we cast about and caped West southwest : we sounded and had 32 . fathoms , and tough oaze like clay . 31 Munday , we doubled about Caninoze , and came at and anchor there , to the intent that we might kill some fish if God would permit it , and there we gate a great Nuse , which Nuses were there so plenty , that they would scarcely suffer any other fish to come near the hooks : the said Nuses carried away sundry of our hooks and leads . A little after at a West Sun , the wind began to blow stormy at West southwest , so that we were feign to weigh and forsake our fishing ground , and went close by the wind Southwest , and Southwest and by West , making our way South southwest . September . i r I ' Uesday at a West Sun we sounded and had 20 . A fathoms , and broken Wilkeshels : I reckoned Canonise to be 24 . leagues Northnortheast from us . 11 The eleventh day we arrived at Colmogro , and there we wintered , expecting the approach of the next Summer to proceed farther in our intended discovery for the Ob : which ( by reason of our employments to Wardhouse the next spring for the search of some English ships ) was not accordingly performed .
