That worthy king I leave , Edgar by name , And all the Chronike of his worthy fame : Saffe only this I may not pass away , A word of mighty strength till that I say , That granted him God such worship here , For his merits , he was without peer , That sometime at his great festivity Kings , and Earls of many a country , And princes feel were there present , And many Lords came thider by assent , To his worship : but in a certain day He bade ships to be ready of array : For to visit Saint Johns Church he list Rowing unto the good holy Baptist , He assigned to Earls , Lords , and knights Many ships right goodly to sights : And for himself and eight kings moo Subject to him he made keep one of thoo , A good ship , and entrede into it With eight kings , and down did they fit ; And eke of them and over took in hand , At over hales , as I understand , And he himself at the ship behind As steris man it became of kind . Such another rowing 1 dare well say , Was not seen of Princes many a day . Lo than how he in waters god the price , In land , in see , that 1 may not suffice To tell , Oh right , Oh magnanimity , That king Edgar had upon the see .
