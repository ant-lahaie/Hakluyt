called Agoada de Saldanha , lying 15 leagues Northward on the hither side of the Cape . The first of August being Sunday we came to and anchor in the Bay , sending our men on land , and there came unto them certain black Salvages very brutish which would not stay , but retired from them . For the space of 15 or 20 days we could find no relief but only fowls which we killed with our pieces , which were cranes and geese : there was no fish but muscles and other shellfish , which we gathered on the rocks . After 15 or 20 days being here , our Admiral went with his pinnace unto the Hand which lies off this Bay , where he found great store of Penguines & Seals , whereof he brought good plenty with him . And twice after that we sent certain of our men , which at both times brought their bots lading unto our ships . After we had be here some time , we god here a Negro , whom we compelled to march into the country with us , making signs to bring us some cattle ; but at this time we could come to the sighed of none , so we let the Negro go with some trifles . Within 8 days after , he with 30 or 40 other Negroes , brought us down some 40 bullocks and oxen , with as many sheep : at Bullocks , oxen , which time we bought but few of them . But within 8 and keep , days after they came down with as many more , & then we bought some 24 oxen with as many sheep . We bought and ox for two knives , a stirke for a knife , and a sheep for a knife , and some we bought for less valve then a knife . The oxen be very large and well fleshed , but not fat . The sheep are very big and very good meat , they have no will on their backs but hair , and have great tails
