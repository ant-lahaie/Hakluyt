A letter of James Alday to the Worshipful M . Michael Lock , Agent in London for the Moscovie company , touching a trade to be established in Lappia , written 157 5 . He marvelleth the company do not confer with him open Lappia . Have in remembrance ( worshipful Sir ) the talk we had when I was with you , as touching the trade in Lappia : And certainly I have something marveiled that in all this time the right wor . your society have not given order that some little conference ( by you , or with some other ) might have been had with me touching those parts , considering they know ( as I think ) that I remained there one whole year & more , by which means reason would that I should have learned something . But the cause why they have not desired to confer with me ( as I judge ) rests only in one of these 4 cases , that is to say , either they think themselves so thoroughly certified of that trade , as more need not be spoken thereof , or that they have no lust more to deal that ways , or that they hold me so untrusty to them that they dare not open their minds , for fear or doubt , I should bear more affection to others then to them , & so discover their secrets : or else they think me of so simple understanding , that I am not worthy to be spoken with in these matters . To which 4 cases I answer as follows : First , if they think themselves so thoroughly certified as more need not to be spoken : certainly I something marvel by whom it should be : for in you winter past there lay but 5 English persons there , viz . Christopher Colt , Roger Leche , Adam Tunstal cooper , one lad , and I : for Henry Cocknedge was the whole winter at Mosco . And of these persons , as touching Colt , I think him ( if I may without offence speak my conscience ) the most simple person that was there , ( as touching the understanding of a merchant ) although indeed he took upon him very much to his own harm 197 > 5 74 - 5 English men wintered in Lappia .
