King him the letters of our king , Edward the sixt . The etten ^ Emperor having taken , & read the letters , began a delivered to question with them , and to ask them of the welfare of our king : whereunto our men answered him directly , & in few words : hereupon our men presented some thing to the Emperor , by the chief Secretary , which at the delivery of it , put of his hat , being before all the time covered : and so the Emperor having invited them to dinner , dismissed them from his presence : and going into the chamber of him that was Master of the Requests to the Emperor , & having stayed there the space of two hours , at the last , the Messenger comes , and calls them to dinner : they go , and being conducted into the golden Court , ( for so they call it , although not very fair ) they find the Emperor sitting upon and high and stately seat , appareled with a robe of silver , and with another Diadem on his head : our men being placed over against him , fit down : in the mids of the room stood a mighty Cupboard upon a square foot , whereupon stood also a round board , in manner of a Diamond , broad beneath , and towards the top narrow , and every step rose up more narrow then another . Upon this Cupboorde was placed the Emperors plate , which was so much , that the very Cupboard it self was scant able to sustain the weight of it : the better part of all the vessels , and goblets , was made of very fine gold : and among the rest , there were foure pots of very large bigness , which did adorn the rest of the plate in great measure : for they were so high , that they thought them at the least five foot long . There were also upon this Cupboard certain silver casks , not much differing from the quantity of our Fyrkins ,
