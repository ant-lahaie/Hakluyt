chekins , which the captain of Ormus did take , and paid for the same twentie pardaos , which is one hundred larines , and was worth there or here one hundred chekins . Also he had five emrauds set in gold , which were worth five hundred or sixe hundred crowns , and paid for the same and hundred pardaos . Also he had nineteene and a half pikes of cloth , which cost in London twenty shillings the pike , and was worth 9 or 10 crowns the pike , and he paid for the same twelve larines a pike . Also he had two pieces of green Kersies , which were worth foure and twentie pardaos the piece , and paid for them sixteene pardaos a piece : beside diverse other trifles , that the officers and others had in the like order , and some for nothing at all . But the cause of all this was Michael Stropene , which came to Ormus not worth a penny , and now hath thirtie or fortie thousand crowns , and he grieveth that any other stranger should trade thither but himself . But that shall not skill , for I trust in God to go both thither and hither , and to buy and fell as freely as he or any other . Here is very great good to be done in diverse of our commodities , and in like manner there is great profit to be made with commodities of this country , to be carried to Aleppo . It were long for me to write , and tedious for you to read of all things that have passed since my parting from you . But of all the troubles that have chanced since mine arrival in Ormus , this bringer is able to certify you . I mind to stay here : wherefore if you will write 462 1584 - unto me , you may send your letters to some friend at Lisbone , & from thence by the ships they may be conveyed hither . Let the direction of your letters be either [ II i . 250 . ] in Portuguise or Spanish , whereby they may come the better to my hands . From Goa this 20 day of Januarie . 1584 .
