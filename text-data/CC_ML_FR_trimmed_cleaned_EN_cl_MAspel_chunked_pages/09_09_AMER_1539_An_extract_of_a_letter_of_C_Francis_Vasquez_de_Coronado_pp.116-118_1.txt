go at certain seasons to their sacrifices into a valley situate in that Province , which is inhabited with people , esteemed by those of the country as saints and priests , whom they call Chichimecas , which dwell in the woods without houses : and they eat such things as they of the country give them of alms . They go naked , and are tanned in the smoke , and tie their privy member with a string unto their knee , and the women likewise go stark naked . They have certain temples covered with straw , with small round windows full of the skulls of dead men ; before their temple is a great round ditch , the brim whereof is compassed with the figure of a serpent made of gold and silver , and with another mixture of unknown metals : and this serpent holds his tail in his mouth . They of this valley from time to time cast lots , whose luck it shall be to be sacrificed , and they make him great cheer , on whom the lot falls , and with great joy they crown him with flowers upon a bed prepared in the said ditch all full of flowers and sweet herbs , on which they lay him along , and lay great store of dry wood on both sides of him , and set it on fire on either part , and so 117 he dyeth . Where he continueth so quietly without being bound , as though he did something , wherein he took great pleasure . And they say that he is a Saint , and do worship him for that year , and sing praises , and Hymns unto him , and afterwards set up his head with the rest in order within those windows . Also they sacrifice their prisoners , whom they burn in another deeper ditch , and not with the foresaid ceremonies . The Spanyards which are in Xalisco write , that having good assistance , they hope that those people will become Christians . The Country is very good and fruitful , and hath great store of good and wholesome waters .
