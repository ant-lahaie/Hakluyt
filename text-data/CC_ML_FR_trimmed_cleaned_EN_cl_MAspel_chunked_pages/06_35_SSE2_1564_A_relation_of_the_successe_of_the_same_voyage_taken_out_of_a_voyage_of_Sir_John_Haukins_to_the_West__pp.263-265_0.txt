The success of this Voyage in part appears [ U . ii . 56 . ] by certain brief relations extracted out of the second voyage of Sir John Hawkins to the West Indies , made in the said year 1564 . which I thought good to set down for want of further instructions , which hitherto I could not by any means come by , albeit I have used all possible endeavour for the obtaining of the same : Take them therefore in the mean season as followeth . Aster John Hawkins , with the Jesus of Lubeck a ship of 700 . tons , and the Salomon , a ship of 7 score , the Tiger a bark of 50 , and the Swallow of 30 tons , being all well furnished with men to the number of one hundred threescore and ten , as also with ordi nance and victuali requisite for such a voyage , departed out of Plimmouth the 18 day of October in the year of our Lord 1564 . with a prosperous wind : at which departing , in cutting the foresail , a marvellous misfortune happened to one of the officers in the ship , who by the pully of the sheat was slain out of hand being a sorrowful beginning to them all .
