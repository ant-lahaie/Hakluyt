Letto 60 thousand men , and toward the Nagayan Tartars sixtie thousand , which is wonder to hear of : yet doth he never take to his wars neither husbandman nor merchant . All his men are horsemen : he uses no footmen , but such as go with the ordinance and labourers , which are thirtie thousand . The horsemen are all archers , with such bows as the Turkes have , and they ride short as do the Turkes . Their armour is a coat of plate , with a skull on their heads . Some of their coats are covered with velvet or cloth of gold : their desire is to be sumptuous in the field , and especially the nobles and gentlemen : as I have herd their trimming is very costly , and partly I have seen it , or else I would scarcely have believed it : but the Duke himself is richly attired above all measure : his pavilion is covered either with cloth of gold or silver , and so set with stones that it is wonderful to see it . I have seen the Kings Majesties of England and the French Kings pavilions , which are fair , yet not like unto his . And when they be sent into far or strange countries ' , or that strangers come to them , they be very gorgeous . Else the Duke 229 himself goes but meanly in apparel : and when he goes betwixt one place and another he is but reasonably appareled over other times . In the while that I was in Mosco the Duke sent two ambassadors to the King of Poleland , which had at the lest five hundred horses ; their sumptuousness was above measure , not only in themselves , but also in their horses , as velvet , cloth of gold , and cloth of silver set with pearls and not scant . What shall I farther say ? I never herd of nor saw men so sumptuous : but it is no daily guise , for when they have not occasion , as I said before
