Manoa was Juan Martinez master of the munition to Ordas . At a port called Morequito in Guiana there lies at this day a great anchor of Ordas his ship ; and this port is some 300 miles within the land , upon the great river of Orenoque . I rested at this port foure days : twenty days after I left the ships at Curiapan . The relation of this Martinez ( who was the first that discovered Manoa ) his success and end are to be seen in the Chancery of Saint Juan de Puerto rico , whereof Berreo had a copy , which appeared to be the greatest encouragement aswell to Berreo as to others that formerly attempted the discovery and conquest . Orellana after he failed of the discovery of Guiana by the said river of Amazones , passed into Spaine , and there obtained a patent of the king for the invasion and conquest , but died by sea about the Islands , and his fleet severed by tempest , the actium for that time proceeded not . Diego Ordas followed the enterprise , and departed Spaine with 600 soldiers , and 30 horse , who arriving on the coast of Guiana , was slain in a mutiny , with the most part of such as favoured him , as also of the rebellious part , insomuch as his ships perished , and few or none returned , neither was it certainly known what became of the said Orgas , until Berreo found the anchor of his ship in the river of Orenoque ; but it was supposed , and so it is written by Lopez , that he perished on the seas , and of other writers diversely conceived and reported . And hereof it came that Martines entered so far within the land , and arrived at that city of Inga the emperor ; for it chanced that while Ordas with his army rested at the port of Morequito ( who was either the first or second that attempted Guiana ) by some negligence , the whole store of powder provided for the service was set on
