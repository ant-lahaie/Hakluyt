The worthy enterprise of John Foxe and Englishman in delivering 266 . Christians out of the captivity of the Turkes at Alexandria , the 3 . of Januarie 1577 . Mong our merchant ' s here in England , it is a common voyage to traffic into Spaine : whereunto a ship , being called The three half Moons , manned with 38 . men , and well fenced with munitions , the better to encounter their enemies withal , and having wind & tide , set from Portsmouth , 1563 . and bent her journey towards Sivill a city in Spaine , intending there to traffic with them . And falling near the Straights , they perceived themselves to be beset round with eight galleys of the Turkes , in such wise , that there was no way for them to fly or escape away , but that either they must yield or else be sunk . Which the owner perceiving , manfully encouraged his company , exhorting them valiantly to show their manhood , showing them that God was their God , and not their enemies , requesting them also not to faint in seeing such a heap of their enemies ready to devour them ; putting them in mind also , that if it were Gods pleasure to give them into their enemies hands , it was not they y ‘ ought to show one displeasant look or countenance thereagainst ; but to take it patiently , & not to prescribe a day and time for their deliverance , as the citizens of Bethulia did , but to put themselves under his mercy . And again , if it were his mind and good will to show his mighty power by them , if their enemies were ten times so many , they were not able to stand in their hands ; putting them likewise in mind of the old and ancient worthiness of their countrymen , who in the hardest extremities have always most prevailed and gone away conquerors , yea , and where it hath be almost impossible . Such ( quoth he ) hath ’ S3 John Fox taken 1563 . be the valiantness of our countrymen ,
