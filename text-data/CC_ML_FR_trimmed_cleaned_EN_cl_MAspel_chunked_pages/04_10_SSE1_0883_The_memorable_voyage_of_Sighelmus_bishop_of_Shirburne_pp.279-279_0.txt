A testimony of the sending of Sighelmus Bishop of Shirburne , by King Alphred , unto Saint Thomas of India in the year of our Lord 883 , recorded by William of Malmesburie , in his second book and fourth Chapter de gestis regum Anglorum . The same in English . King Alphred being addicted to giving of alms , confirmed the privileges of Churches as his father had determined ; and sent also many gifts beyond the seas unto Room , and unto S . Thomas of India . His messenger in this business was Sighelmus bishop of Schir - burne ; who with great prosperity ( which is a matter to be wondered at in this our age ) travailed through India , and returning home brought with him many strange and precious unions and costly spices , such as that country plentifully yields .
