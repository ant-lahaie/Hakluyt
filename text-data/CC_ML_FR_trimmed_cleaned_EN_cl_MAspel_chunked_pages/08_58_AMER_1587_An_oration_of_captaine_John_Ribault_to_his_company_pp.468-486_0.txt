I think there is none of you that is ignorant of how his compete Â° great consequence this our enterprise is , and also how acceptable it is unto our young King . Therefore my friends ( as one desiring your honour and benefit ) I would not fail to advertise you all of the exceeding good happen which should fallen to them , which , as men of valour and worthy courage , would make trial in this our first discovery of the benefits and commodities of this new land : which should be , as I assure my self , the greatest occasion that ever could happen unto them , to arise unto the title and degree of honour . And for this cause I was desirous to propose unto you and set down before your eyes the eternal memory which of right they deserve , which forgetting both their parents and their country have had the courage to enterprise a thing of such importance , which even kings themselves understanding to be men aspiring to so high degree of 468 magnanimity and increase of their majesties , do not disdain so well to regard , that afterwards employing them in maters of weight & of high enterprise , they make their names immortali for ever . Howbeit , I would not have you persuade your selves , as many do , that you shall never have such good fortune , as not being known neither to the king nor the Princes of the Realm , and beside descending of so poor a stock , that few or none of your parents , having ever made profession of arms , have be known unto the great estates . For albeit that from my tender years I my self have applied all my industry to follow them , and have hazarded my life in so many dangers for the service of my prince , yet could I never attain thereunto ( not that I did not deserve this title and degree of government ) as I have seen it happen to many others , only because they descend of a noble raze , since more regard is had of their birth then of their virtue .
