from home , they take bows and arrows with them , and whomsoever they find in the night season , they put him to death , hiding themselves in the day time . And having tired their horses , they go in the night unto a company of other horses feeding in some pasture , and change them for new , taking with them also one or two horses beside , to eat them when they stand in need . Our guide therefore was soar afraid , lest we should have met with such companions . In this journey we had died for famine , had we not carried some of our biscuit with us . At length we came unto the mighty river of Etilia , or Volga . For it is foure times greater , then the river of Sein , and of a wonderful depth : and issuing forth of Bulgaria the greater , it runneth into a certain lake or sea , which of late they call the Hircan sea , according to the name of a certain city in Persia , standing upon the shore thereof . Howbeit Isidore calls it the Caspian sea . For it hath the Caspian mountains and the land of Persia situate on the South side thereof : and the mountains of Musihet , that is to say , of the people called Assassini towards the East , which mountains are conjoined unto the Caspian mountains : but on the North side thereof lies the same desert , wherein the Tartars do now inhabit . Howbeit heretofore there dwelled certain 270 I253 - people called Changlae . And on that side it receives ChangLe . the streams of Etilia ; which river increases in Summer time , like unto the river Nilus in . / Egypt . Upon the West part thereof , it hath the mountains of Alani , and Lesgi , and Porta ferrea , or Derbent , and the mountains of Georgia . This Sea therefore is compassed in on three sides with the mountains , but on the North side with plain ground . Frier Andrew , in his journey
