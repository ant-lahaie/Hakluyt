, the great heaps , and mountains of ice , in the midst of the Sea have taught us : some of our company report , that in May , they were sometime kept in , with such huge ice , for 16 . whole days together , as that the Islands thereof were threescore fathoms thick , the sides whereof which were towards the Sun , when they were melted , the whole mass or heap was so inverted and turned in manner of balancing , that that part which was before downward rose upward , to the great peril of those that are near them , as by reason we may gather . The air upon land is indifferent clear , but at Sea towards the East there is nothing else but perpetuali mists , and in the Sea it self , about the Bank ( for so they call the place where they find ground fourty leagues distant from the shore , and where they begin to fish ) there is no day without rain . When we have served , and supplied our necessity in this place , we purpose by the help of God to pass towards the South , with so much the more hope every day , by how much the greater the things are , that are reported of those Countries ' , which we go to discover . Thus much touching our estate . Now I desire to know somewhat concerning you , but I fear in vain , but specially I desire out of measure to know how my Patron master Henry Umpton does take my absence : my obedience , and duty shall always be ready towards him as long as I live : but in deed I hope , that this journey of ours shall profitable to his intentions . It remains that you think me to be still yours , and so yours as no men more . The son of God bless all our labors , so far , as that you your self may be partaker of our blessing . Adieu , my most friendly , most sweet , most virtuous Hakluyt : In Newfound land , at Saint Johns Port , the 6 . of August . 1583 . STEVEN PARMENIUS of Buda , yours .
