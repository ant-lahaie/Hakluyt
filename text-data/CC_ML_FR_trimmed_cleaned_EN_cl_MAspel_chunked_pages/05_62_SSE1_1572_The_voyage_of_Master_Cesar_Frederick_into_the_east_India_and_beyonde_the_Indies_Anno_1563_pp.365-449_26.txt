or ports . First when you go into the place where the king did lodge , there are five great ports or gates : these are kept with Captains and soldiers : then within these there are foure lesser gates : which are kept with Porters . Without the first gate there is a little porch , where there is a Captain with five and twentie soldiers , that keepeth watch and ward night and day : and within that another with the like guard , wherethorow they come to a very fair Court , and at the end of that Court there is another porch as the first , with the like guard , and within that another Court . And in this wise are the first five gates guarded and kept with those Captains : and then the lesser gates within are kept with a guard of Porters : which gates stand open the greatest part of the night , because the custom of the Gentiles is to do their business , and make their feasts in the night , rather then by day .
