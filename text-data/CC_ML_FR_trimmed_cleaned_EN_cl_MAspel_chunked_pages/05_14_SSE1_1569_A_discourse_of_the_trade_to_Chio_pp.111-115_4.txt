the books of Sir John Gresham , and his brothers , and you shall find what I have said to be true . Also you know , that we are forced to seek oils out of Spaine , and that for these many years they have be sold for 25 pound and 30 pound the tun : whereas , if we can obtain the foresaid safeconduct from the Turke , there are diverse places in his dominions , where we may lade 500 tons , at 5 pound sterling the tun . The places are Modon , and Coron , which are but twelve miles distant the one from the other , and do stand in our way to Chio , as you may plainly see by the Card . Also these are places where we may utter our own commodities , and not only these two places , 114 but many others , where we may have oils , and be better used then we are in Spaine , where we pay very deer , and also are very evil entreated many ways , as to you is not unknown . So that by these means ( if the merchants will ) we may be eased , and have such a trade as the like is not in Christendome . Now , as for getting thee safeconduct , if I were but able to spend one hundred pounds by the year , I would be bound to loose it , if that I did not obtain the foresaid safeconduct . For I know that if the inhabitants of Chio did but think that we would trade thither again , they at their own cost would procure to us a safeconduct , without any penny of charges to the merchants . So that if the merchants will but bear my charges to solicit the cause , I will undertake it my self . Wherefore I pray you speak to M . Winter and the other merchants , that this matter may take effect . And let me have your answer herein assoon as conveniently you may , for that the time of the year draws nigh that this business must be done . Thus I commit you to God , and rest always yours to command . Yours as your servant Gaspar Campion .
