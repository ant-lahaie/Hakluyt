ground , he loses his office . He is not served very But his alms sumptuously he is maintained by alms . The heads and are beards - of his ministers are shaved , they have name Cangues , and their authority is great throughout all Japan . The Cubucama uses them for Ambassadors to 335 decide controversies betwixt princes and to end their wars , whereof they were wont to make very great gain . It is now two years since or there about , that one of them came to Bungo , to entreat of peace betwixt the king thereof and the king of Amanguzzo . This Agent favouring the king of Bungo his cause more then the other , brought to pass that the foresaid king of Bungo should keep two kingdoms , the which he had taken in wars from the king of Amanguzzo . Wherefore he had for his reward of the king of Bungo above 30000 ducats . And thus far hereof . I come now to other superstitions and ceremonies , that you may see , deer brothers , that which I said in the beginning , how subtly the devil hath deceived the Japonish nation , and how diligent and ready they be to obey & worship him . And first , all remembrance and knowledge not only of Christ our Redeemer , but also of that one God the maker of all things is clean extinguished and utterly abolished out of the Japans hearts . Moreover their superstitious sects are many , whereas it is lawful for each one to follow that which liketh him best : but the principali sects are two , namely the Amidans and Xacaians . Wherefore in this country shall you see many monasteries , not only of Bonzii men , but also of Bonziae women diversely attired , for some do wear white under , and black upper garments , other go appareled in ash colour , and their Idol hath to name Denichi : from these the Amidanes differ very much . Again the men Bonzii for the most part dwell in sumptuous houses , and have great revenues .
