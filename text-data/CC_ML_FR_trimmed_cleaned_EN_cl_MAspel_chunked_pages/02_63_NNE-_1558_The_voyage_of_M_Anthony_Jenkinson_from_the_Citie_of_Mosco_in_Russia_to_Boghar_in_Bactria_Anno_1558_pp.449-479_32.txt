there rose a soar storm , which continued 44 . hours , and our cable being of our own spinning , brake , and lost our anchor , and being off a lee shore , and having no boat to help us , we hoised our sail , and bore roomer with the said shore , looking for present death : but as God provided for us , we ran into a creek full of oz , and so saved our selves with our bark , & lived in great discomfort for a time . For although we should have escaped with our lives the danger of the sea , yet if our bark had perished , we knew we should have be , either destroyed , or taken slaves by the people of that Country , who live wildly in the field , like beasts , without house or habitation . Thus when the storm was seized , we went out of the creek again : and having set the land with our Compass , and taken certain marks of the same , during the time of the tempest , whilst we rid at our anchor , we went directly to the place where we rid , with our bark again , and found our anchor which we lost : whereat the Tartars much marveiled , how we did it . While we were in the creek , we made and anchor of wood of cart wheels , which we had in our bark , which we threw away , when we had found our iron anchor again . Within two days after , there arose another great storm , at the Northeast , and we lay a try , being driven far into the sea , and had much ado to keep 476 1559 - our bark from sinking , the billow was so great : but at the last , having fair weather , we took the Sun , and knowing how the land lay from us , we fell with the River Yaik , according to our desire , whereof the Tartars were very glad ,
