and as they may with ease : There is no doubt , but for the time following , they may have victuals that are excellent good and plenty enough , some more English sorts of cattle also hereafter , as some have be before , and are there yet remaining , may , and shall be ( God willing ) thither transported . So likewise , our kind of fruits , roots , and herbs , may be there planted and sowed , as some have be already , and prove well : And in short time also they may raise so much of those sorts of commodities which I have spoken of , as shall both enrich themselves , as also others that shall deal with them . And this is all the fruit of our labours , that I have thought necessary to advertise you of at this present : What else concerns the nature and manners of the inhabitants of Virginia , the number with the particularities of the voyages thither made , and of the actions of such as have be by Sir Walter Ralegh therein , and there employed , many worthy to be remembered , as of VIII 385 2B the first discoverers of the Country , of our general for the time Sir Richard Grinvil , and after his departure of our Governor there Master Ralph Lane , with diverse other directed and employed under their government : Of the Captains and Master ' s of the voyages made since for transportation , of the Governor and assistants of those already transported , as of many persons , accidents , and things else , I have ready in a discourse by it self in manner of a Chronicle , according to the course of times : which when time shall be thought convenient , shall be also published . Thus referring my relation to your favourable constructions , expecting good success of the actium , from him which is to be acknowledged the author and governor , not only of this , but of all things else , I take my leave of you , this month of February 1587 .
