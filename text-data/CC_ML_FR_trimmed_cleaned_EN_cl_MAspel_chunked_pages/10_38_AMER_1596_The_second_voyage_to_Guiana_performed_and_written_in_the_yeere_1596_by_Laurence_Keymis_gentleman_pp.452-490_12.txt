they are fully persuaded , that by driving these Arwaccas , who serve the Spaniards ( for a great part of this nation does also hate , or not know them ) out of their territories , and Trinidad , the Spaniards for want of bred , will be enforced to seek habitation farther ofF , or at the least in time consume and be wasted . 462 The 6 . day of Aprill we came to and anchor within the 2 % mouth of the river Raleana , having spent twentie and or three days in discovery upon this coast . The channel Qreno ^ of this river hath sixe or seven fathom depth , nine or ten miles off at sea , the bar lies farther out , and at low water hath not full two fathom . It highs not above five foot , except at a spring tIED . we anchored in ten fathom the first night : the next morning twelve Canoas came unto us , furnished and provided of victuals after their manner for the wars . Their Captains names were Anwara , and Aparwa . These Cassiques , when the Spaniards made the last inroad in those parts , were in the inland among the Iwarawakeri their neighbours , by which occasion having lost some of their wives ( for not - Spanish withstanding their profession of Christianitie , some of these Spaniards keep ten or twelve women , thinking themselves well and surely blessed , howsoever they live , if their town and houses be religiously crossed ) they kept together 30 . Canoas , hoping at our coming , which they had now long expected to recover this loss upon them and the Arwaccas , who in their absence had done this wrong . They showed me this their purpose , & required to be joined in league of friendship with us against our enemies . When of them I had learned so much of the present estate of the country , as they did know : they demanded whither we had brought no more forces with us , but only one ship ?
