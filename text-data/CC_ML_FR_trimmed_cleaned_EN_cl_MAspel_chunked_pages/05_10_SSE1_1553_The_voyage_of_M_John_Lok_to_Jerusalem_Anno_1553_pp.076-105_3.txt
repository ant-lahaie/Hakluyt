This city of Ragusa payeth tribute to the Turke Ragusa paleth yearly fourteene thousand Sechinos , and every Sechino t0 is of Venetian money eight livers and two soldes , beside the Turke other presents which they give to the Turkes Bassas yearly . when they come thither . The Venetians have a rock or crag within a mile of the said town , for the which the Raguseos would give them much money , but they do keep it more for the namesake , then for profit . This rock lies on the Southside of the town , and is called II cromo , there is nothing on it but only a 11 Cromo . Monastery called Sant Jeronimo . The main of the Turkes country is bordering on it within one mile , for the which cause they are in great subjection . This night we were put back by contrary winds , and anchored at Melleda - The 24 being at and anchor under Melleda , we would have gone on land , but the wind came so fair that we presently set sail and went our course , and left on the right hand of us the forenamed Hand , and on the left hand between us and the main the Hand of Zupanna , and within a mile of that under the main Zupanna . by East , another Hand called Isola de Mezo . This Hand de hath two Monasteries in it , one called Santa Maria de â€™ Bizo , and the other Sant Nicholo . Also there is a third rock with a Frierie called Sant Andrea : these Hands are Sant ^ n ^' ea - Boca de Cataro , The town Cataro . Budoa . Antiveri . Marchevetti .
