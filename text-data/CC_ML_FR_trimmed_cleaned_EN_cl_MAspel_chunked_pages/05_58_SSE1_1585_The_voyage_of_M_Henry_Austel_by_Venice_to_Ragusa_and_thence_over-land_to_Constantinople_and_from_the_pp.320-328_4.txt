which by report was the last town that remained Christian . The 9 . of September we arrived at the great and Constantin - most stately City of Constantinople , which for the situation and proud seat thereof , for the beautiful and commodious havens , and for the great and sumptuous buildings of their Temples , which they call Moschea , is to be preferred before all the Cities of Europe . And there the Emperor of the Turkes then living , whose name was Amurat , kept his Court and residence , in a marvelous goodly place , with diverse gardens and houses of pleasure , which is at the least two English miles in compass , and the three parts thereof join upon the sea : and on the Northeast part of the City on the other side of the water over against the City is the Town of Pera , where the most part of the Christians do lie . And there also we did lie . And on the North part of the said Town is the Arsenal , where the Galies are built and do remain : And on the Southside is all the Ordinance , artillery , and houses of munition . Note that by the way as we came from Ragusa to Constantinople , we left on our right hand the Countries ' of Albania , and Macedonia , and on the left hand the countries ' of Bosnia , Bulgaria , and the river of Danubius . The 14 . of September was the Turkes Beyram , that is , one of their chiefest feasts . The 15 . we went to the black Sea called Pontus Pompeys Euxinus , and there upon a rock we saw a pillar of Ptller - white Marble that was set up by Pompeius : and from thence we passed to the other side of the water , upon the shore of Asia and there we dined . The 25 . we departed from Constantinople . The 29 . we came to and ancient Town called Cher - chisea , that is to say , fourtie Churches , which in the 324 old time was a very great City , now full of scattered buildings .
