whereof great waters have their originali , as by er experience is seen otherwhere . Such valleis as are risers in the capable to receive the water , that in the Summer time ground . by the operation of the Sun descendeth from great abundance of snow , which continually lies on the mountains and hath no passage , sinks into the earth and so vanishes away , without any runnell above the earth , by which occasion or continual standing of the said water , the earth is opened , and the great frost yields to the force thereof , which in other places foure or five fathoms within the ground for lack of the said moisture , the earth ( even in the very Summer time ) is frozen , and so combineth the stones together , that scarcely instruments with great force can unknit them . Also where the water in those valleis can have no such passage away , by the continuance of time in such order as is before rehearsed , the yearly descent from the mountains fills them full , that at the lowest bank of the same , they fallen into the valley , and so continue as fishing Ponds or Stagnes in Summer time full of water , and in the Winter hard frozen : as by skarres that remain thereof in Summer may easily be perceived : so that the heat of Summer is nothing comparable or of force to dissolve the extremity of cold that comes in Winter . Nevertheless I am assured that below the force of the frost within the earth , the waters have recourse , and empty themselves out of sighed into the sea , which through the extremity of the frost are constrained to do the same : by which occasion the earth within is kept the warmer , and springs have their recourse , which is the Springs nou - onely nutriment of gold and Minerals within the same . There is much to be said of the commodities of these Countries ' , which are couched within the bowels of the earth , which I let pass till more perfect trial be made
