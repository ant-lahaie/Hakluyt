leans his cheek or chin upon his hand . Then we departed forth , and immediately after came our guide unto us , and conducting us unto our lodging , said unto me : Your master the King requesteth that you may remain in this land , which request Baatu cannot satisfy without the knowledge and consent of Mangu - Can . Wherefore you , and your interpreter must of necessity go unto Mangu - Can .

Then began the man of God mine interpreter to lament , esteeming himself but a dead man .

Moreover I my self said , that without mine associate I could not go : and that we stood in need of two servants at the least , to attend upon us , because , if one should chance to fallen sick , we could not be without another . Then returning unto the court , he told these sayings unto Baatu . And Baatu commanded saying : let 275 the two Priests and the interpreter go together , but let the clerk return unto Sartach . And coming again unto us , he told us even so . And when I would have spoken for the clerk to have had him with us , he said : No more words : for Baatu hath resolved , that so it shall be , and therefore I dare not go unto the court any more . Goset the clerk had remaining of the alms money bestowed upon him , 26 . Yperperas , and no more ; 10 . whereof he kept for himself and for the lad , and 16 . he gave unto the man of God for us .
