The second voyage of M . Laurence Aldersey , to the Cities of Alexandria , and Cayro in Aegypt . Anno 1586 . Embarked my self at Bristoll , in the Hercules , a good ship of London , and set sail the 21 day of Februarie , about ten of the clock in the morning , having a merry wind : but the 23 day , there arose a very great storm , and in the mids of it we descried a small boat of the burden of ten tons , with foure men in her , in very great danger , who called a main for our help . Whereupon our Master made towards them , and took them into our ship , and let the boat , which was laden with timber , and appertained to Chepstow , to run a drift . The same night about midnight arose another great storm , but the wind was large with us , until the 27 of the same month , which then grew somewhat contrary : yet notwithstanding we held on our course , and the tenth day of March , we descried a sail about Cape Sprat , which is a little on this side the straight of Gibraltare , but we spoke not with her . The next day we descried twelve sail more , with whom we thought to have spoken , to have learned what they were , but they made very fast away , and we gave them over . Thursday the 16 of March , we had sighed of the straights , and of the coast of Barbary . The 18 day we passed them , and sailed towards Patras . Upon the 23 of March , we met with the Centurion of London which came from Genoa , by whom we sent letters to England , and the foure men also which we took in , upon the coast of England , beforementioned . The 29 of March we came to Goleta a small Hand , Goleta . and had sighed of two ships , which we judged to be of England . Tuesday the fourth of Aprill , we were before Malta , Malta . 39 and being there becalmed , our Master caused the two ship boats to be had out
