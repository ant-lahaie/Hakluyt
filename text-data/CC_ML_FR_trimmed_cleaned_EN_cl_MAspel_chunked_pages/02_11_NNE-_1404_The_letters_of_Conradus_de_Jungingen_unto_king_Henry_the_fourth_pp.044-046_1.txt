etc . Most sovereign lord & king , & gracious prince , we do with unfeigned and hearty affection embrace the oracles of your majesties most courteous & acceptable offer : wherein you have used most diligent & effectual persuasions , that compliment of justice should be done unto the parties injuried , & that peace & friendship should take place , making no doubt of your own royal person , nor of our selves or of any aPPERTAINING unto us , but that our inclinations and desires in this regard are all one and the same : neither would we lightly transgress the limits of your persuasions without some just , weighty , & reasonable cause , forasmuch as the matters persuaded are in very [ I . 161 . J deed most happy preservatives of a common weal , yea 8c of nature it self . Moreover whereas your highness hath farther requested us , that the prohibition of your subject ' s access unto our dominions might , until the feast of Easter next ensuing , be released : we answer ( under correction of your majesties more deliberate counsel ) that it is far more expedient for both parts to have the said prohibition continued then released , until such time as satisfaction be performed on both sides unto the parties endamaged , not in words only , but actually 8c really in deeds , or by some course of law or friendly composition . For there is no equal nor indifferent kind of consort or trade between the impoverished party and him that is enriched , between the party which hath obtained justice and him that hath obtained none between the offender and the party offended : because they are not moved with like affections . For the remembrance of injuries easily stirs up inconsiderate motions of anger . Also , such a kind of temperature or permixtion , as it were , by way of contrariety breeds more bitterness then sweetness , more hate then love : whereupon more grievous complaints aswell unto your highness as unto our selves , might be occasioned . The lord
