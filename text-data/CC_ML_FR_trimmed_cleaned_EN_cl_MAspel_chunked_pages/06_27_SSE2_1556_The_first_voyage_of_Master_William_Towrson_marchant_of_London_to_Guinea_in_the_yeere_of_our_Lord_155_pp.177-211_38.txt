When he was come he sent our man aboard , and required to have two men pledges , and he himself would come aboard , and I sent him two , of whom he took but one , and so came aboard us , he and his wife with diverse of his friends , and brought me a goat and two great roots , and I gave him again a latten basin , a white basin , 6 manillios , and a bottle of Malmesy , and to his wife a small casket . After this we began to make our measure and weight : and he had a weight of his own which held one angel and 14 grains , and required a measure of 4 208 elles and a half . In fine we concluded the 8 part for one angel and 20 grains , and before we had done , they took mine own weight and measure . The 16 day I took 8 li . 1 ounce of gold : and since the departure of the Hind I herd not of her , but when our pledge went into the country the first night , he said he saw her cast anchor about five leagues from this place . The 17 day I sold about 17 pieces of cloth , & took 4 . li . 4 ounces and a half of gold . The 18 day the captain desired to have some of our wine , and offered half a ducat of gold for a bottle : but I gave it him freely , and made him and his train drink beside .

The 20 day we took 3 li . sixe ounces and a quarter of gold . The 21 we took 8 . li . 7 . ounces and a quarter .
