Thirst , you cannot deny but that this Realm yields 1 ? the most fine Wool ! , the most soft , the most strong Wool , the most durable in Cloth , and most apt of nature of all other to receive Die , and that no Island or any one kingdom so small doth yield so great abundance of the same : and that no Wool is less subject to moths , or to fretting in press , then this , as the old Parliament robes of Kings , & of many noble Peers to be showed may plainly testify . 2 There is no commodity of this Realm that may set so many poor subject ' s on work , as this doth , that doth bring in so much treasure , and so much enrich the merchant , and so much employ the Navy of this Realm , as this commodity of our Wool doth . Ample and full Vent of this noble and rich commodity is it that the common weal of this realm doth require . Spaine now aboundeth with Wools , and the same are Clothed . Turkey hath Wools , and so have diverse provinces of Christendome and of Heatheness , and cloth is made of the same in diverse places . 1 But if England have the most fine , and the most excellent Wools of the world in all respects ( as it cannot be denied , but it hath ) 2 If there may be added to the same , excellent artificiali , and true making , and excellent dying , 3 Then no doubt but that we shall have vent for our Clothes , although the rest of the world did abound much more with Wool then it doth , and although their workmanship and their dying were in every degree equal with ours of England , unless the labour of our people employed that way , and the materials used in dying should be the cause of the contrary by dearth . But if Foreign nations turn their Wools , inferior to ours , into truer and more excellent made cloth , and 232 shall die the same in truer , surer , and more excellent and more delectable
