this time absent from Man . In the year 1217 . deceased Nicolas bishop of the islands , and was buried in Ulster , in the house of Benchor , whom Reginald succeeded . I think it not amiss to report somewhat more concerning the two foresaid brothers Reginaldus and Olavus . REginald gave unto his brother Olavus , the island called Lodhus or Lewes , which is said to be larger then the rest of the islands , but almost destitute of inhabitants , because it is so full of mountains & quarreis , being almost no where fit for tillage . Howbeit the inhabitants thereof do live for the most part upon hunting and fishing . Olavus therefore went to take possession of this Island , and dwelled therein leading a poor life : and when he saw that it would by no means suffice for the sustentation of himself & his followers , he went boldly unto his brother Reginald , who as then remained in the islands , & spoke on this wise unto him . My brother ( Said he ) and my lord and king , you know that the 1223 - kingdom of the islands pertained unto me by right of inheritance , howbeit because the Lord had chosen you to bear the sceptre , I do not envy that honour unto you , neither doth it any whit grieve me that you are exalted unto this royal dignity . Now therefore I beseech you to provide me some portion of land in the islands , whereby I may honestly live . For the Island of Lewis which you gave me is not sufficient for my maintenance . Which his brother Reginald hearing said that he would consult about the premises . And on the morrow , when Olavus was sent for to parley , Reginald commanded him to be attached , and to be carried unto William king of Scotland , and with him to remain prisoner : and Olavus remained in prison almost for the space of 7 . years . But at the 7 . years end William king of Scots deceased , and Alexander his son reigned in his stead .
