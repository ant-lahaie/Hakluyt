And the heighth being taken here , we found our selves to be in the latitude of 60 degrees and a half , and were fallen with the Southermost part of this land . Between Orkney and Frisland are reckoned leagues . This Frislande shows a ragged and high lahde , having the mountains almost covered over with snow alongst the coast full of drift ice , and seems almost inaccessible , and is thought to be and Hand in bigness not inferior to England , and is called of some Authors , West Frislande , I think because it lies more West then any part of Europe .
