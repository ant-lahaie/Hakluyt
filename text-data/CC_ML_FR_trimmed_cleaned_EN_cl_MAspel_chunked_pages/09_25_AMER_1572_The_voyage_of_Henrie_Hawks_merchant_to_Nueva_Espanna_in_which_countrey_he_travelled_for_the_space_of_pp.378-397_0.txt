A relation of the commodities of Nova Hispania , and the manners of the inhabitants , written by Henry Hawks merchant , which lived five years in the said country , and drew the same at the request of M . Richard Hakluyt Esquire of Eiton in the county of Hereford , 1572 . aren ' t John de Ullua is and Island not high above the water , where as now the Spanyards upon M .

In this place all the ships that come out of Spaine with goods for these parts , do unladen : for they have none other port so good as this is .

In these places the North wind hath so great dominion , that oftentimes it destroyeth many ships and barks . This place is given to great sickness . These Islands stand in 18 degrees and a half , and about the same is great plenty of fish . Five leagues from S . John de Ullua is a fair river ; it lies Northwest from the port , and goes to a little town of the Spanyards called Vera Cruz , and with small vessels or barks , which they call frigates , they carry all their merchandise which comes out of Spaine , to the said town : and in like manner bring all the gold , silver , cochinilla , hides , and all other things that the ships carry
