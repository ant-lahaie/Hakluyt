De Guiana carmen Epicum . Hat work of honour and eternal name , For all the t ’ atchieve , Fills me with hands To my hearts world t ’ envie and us fury , and gives armed peace , that else would gladly turn My limbs and every sense into my thoughts Rapt with the thirsted actium of my mind ? O Clio , Honours Muse , sing in my voice , Tell the attempt , and prophecy th ’ exploit Of his Eliza - consecrated sword , That in this peaceful charm of Englands sleep , Opens most tenderly her aged throat , Offering to pour fresh youth through all her veins , That flesh of brass and ribs of steel retains . Riches , and Conquest , and Renown I sing , Riches with honour , Conquest , without blood , Enough to seat the Monarchic of earth , 446 Like to Joves Eagle on Elizas hand . Guiana , whose rich feet are mines of gold , Whose forehead knocks against the roof of Stars , Stands on her tiptoes at fair England looking , Kissing her hand , bowing her mighty breast , And every sign of all submission making , To be her sister , and the daughter both Of our most sacred Maid : whose barren ness Is the true fruit of virtue , that may get , Bear and bring forth anew in all perfection , What heretofore savage corruption held In barbarous Chaos ; and in this affair Become her father , mother , and her heir . Then most admired Sovereign , let your breath Go forth upon the waters , and create A golden world in this our iron age , And be the prosperous forewind to a Fleet , That seconding your last , may go before it In all success of profit and renown : Doubt not but your election was divine , ( Aswell by Fate as your high judgement ordered ) To raise him with choice Bounties , that could add Height to his height ; and like a liberali vine , Not only bear his virtuous fruit aloft , Free from the Press of squint - eyd Envies feet , But deck his gracious Prop with golden bunches , And shroud it with broad leaves of Rule
