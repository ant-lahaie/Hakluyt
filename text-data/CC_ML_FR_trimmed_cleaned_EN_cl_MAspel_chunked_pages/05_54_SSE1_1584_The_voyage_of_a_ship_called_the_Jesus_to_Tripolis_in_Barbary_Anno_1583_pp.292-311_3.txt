: Dickenson said no : and so they protested and swore on both parts . But in the end the said Roman Sonnings did swear deeply with detestable oaths and curses , and prayed God that he might show his works on him , that other might take ensample thereby , and that he might be hanged like a dog , and never come into England again , if he did 294 not deliver unto the said Dickenson and hundred Chikinoes .

The said Patron Norado being void of all hope , and finding now opportunity , consulted with the said Sonnings for to swim a seaboorde the Islands , and the ship being then out of danger , should take him in ( as after was confessed ) and so to go to Tolon in the province of Marseilis with this Patron Norado , and there to take in his lading . The ship being ready the first day of May , and having her sails all aboard , our said Factors did take their leave of the king , who very courteously bid them farewell
