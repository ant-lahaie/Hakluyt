rich , and sumptuous in building . Within the same in a corner thereof is a tomb built upon foure pillars with a vault , as if it were under a pavement , which binds all the foure pillars together . The tomb is so high , that it far exceeds in height the Mosquita , being covered with led , and the top all enameled with gold , with and half moon upon the top : and within the pavement it is all very artificially wrought with gold . Below there , are round about very great stairs of iron ascending up until the midst of the pillars , and in the very midst thereof is buried the body of Mahomet , and not in a chest of iron cleaving to the adamant , as many affirm that know not the truth thereof . Moreover , over the body they have built a tomb of speckled stone | | Or , a a II brace and and half high , and over the same another of fathom . Legmame foursquare in manner of a pyramid . After this , round about the sepulture there hangs a curtain of silk , which lets the sighed of those without , that they cannot see the sepulture . Beyond this in the same Mosquita are other two sepulchres covered with green cloth , and in the one of them is buried Fatma the daughter of Mahomet , and Alli is buried in the other , who was the husband of the said Fatma . The attendants upon these sepulchres are fifty eunuchs white and tawny , neither is it granted to any of them to enter within the tomb , saving to three white eunuchs the oldest and best of credit ; unto whom it is lawful to enter but twice in the day , to light the lamps , and to do other services . All the other eunuchs attend without to the service of the Mosquita , and the other two sepulchres of Fatma , and Alli , where every one may go and touch at his pleasure , and take of the earth for devotion
