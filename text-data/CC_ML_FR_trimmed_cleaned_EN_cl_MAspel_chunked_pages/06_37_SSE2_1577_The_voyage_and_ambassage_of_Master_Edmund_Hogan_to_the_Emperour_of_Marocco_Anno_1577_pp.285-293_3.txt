Spaine sought to disgrace the Queen if her Ambassador . placed on both sides of my horse , and so brought me to the kings palace . The king sat in his chair with his Counsel about him , as well the Moors as the Elchies , and according to his order given unto me before , I there declared my message in Spanish , and made delivery of the Queens Majesties letters , and all that I spoke at that present in Spanish , he caused one of his Elchies to declare the same to the Moors present , in the Larbe tongue . Which done , he answered me again in Spanish , yielding to the Queens Majesty great thanks , and offering himself and his country to be at her Graces commandment , and then commanded certain of his Counsellors to conduct me to my lodging , not being far from the Court . The house was fair after the fashion of that country , being daily well furnished with all kind of victuali at the kings charge . The same night he sent for me to the Court , and I had conference with him about the space of two hours , where I thoroughly declared the charge committed unto me from her Majesty , finding him conformable , willing to pleasure and not to urge her Majesty with any demands , more then conveniently she might willingly consent unto , he knowing that out of his country the Realm of England might be better served with lacks , then he in comparison from us . Further he gave me to understand , that the king of Spaine had sent unto him for a licence , that and Ambassador of his might come into his country , and had made great means that if the Queens majesty of England sent any unto him , that he would not give him any credit or entertainment , albeit ( said he ) I know what the king of Spaine is , and what the Queen of England and her Realm is : for I neither like of him nor of his religion , being so governed by the Inquisition that
