, that water runneth within the earth through certain veins of Brimstone & Allom , and from thence takes not only heat , but taste also , & other strange qualities . Aristotle in his book de Mundo hath taught this . The earth ( says he ) containeth within it fountains not only of water , but also of spirit & fire : some of them flowing like rivers , do cast forth read hight iron : from whence also doth flow , sometimes lukewarm water , sometimes scalding hight , and sometimes temperate .
