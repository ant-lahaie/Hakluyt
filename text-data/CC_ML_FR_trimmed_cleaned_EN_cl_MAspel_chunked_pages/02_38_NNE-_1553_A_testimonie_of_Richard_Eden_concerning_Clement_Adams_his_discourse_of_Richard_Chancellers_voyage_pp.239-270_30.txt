divine service is all done and said in their own language , that every man may understand it : they receive the Lords Supper with leavened bred , 265 and after the consecration , they carry it about the Church in a sauncer , and prohibit no man from receiving and taking of it , that is willing so to do . They use both the Oide and the New Testament , and read both in their own language , but so confusedly , that they themselves that do read , understand not what themselves do say : and while any part of either Testament is read , there is liberty given by custom to prattle , talk , and make a noise : but in the time of the rest of the service they use very great silence and reverence and behave themselves very modestly , and in good sort . As touching the Lords prayer , the tenth man among them knows it not : and for the articles of our raith , and the ten commandments , no man , or at the least very few of them do either know them or can say them : their opinion is , that such secret and holy things as they are should not rashly and imprudently be communicated with the common people . They hold for a Maxim among them , that the old Law , and the commandments also are abolished by the death and blood of Christ : all studies and letters of humanity they utterly refuse : concerning the Latin , Greek , and Hebrew tongues , they are altogether ignorant in them . Every year they celebrate foure several fasts , which they call according to the names of the Saints : the first begins with them , at the time that our Lent begins . The second is called among them the fast of S . Peter . The third is taken from the day of the Virgin Marry . And the fourth and last begins upon S . Philips day . But as we begin our Lent upon Wednesday , so they begin theirs upon the Sunday
