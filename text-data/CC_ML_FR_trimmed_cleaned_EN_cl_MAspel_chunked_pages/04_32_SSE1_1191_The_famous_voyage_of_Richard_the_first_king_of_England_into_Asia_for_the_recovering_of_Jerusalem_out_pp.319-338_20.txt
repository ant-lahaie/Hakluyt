, and iv 337 v A . D . 1193 - The just judgement of God upon the Duke of Austria . [ II i . 28 . ] Civitas Joppe . the hostages given for the ransom of the King , I have and old historic which says , that the aforesaid Duke of Austridge was shortly after plagued by God , with 5 . sundry plagues . First , with the burning of his chief Towns . 2 . With drowning of tenne thousand of his men in a flood happening no man can tell how . 3 . By turning all the ears of his corn fields into worms . 4 . By taking away almost all the Nobles of his land by death . 5 . By breaking his own leg falling from his horse , which leg he was compelled to cut ofF with his own hands , and afterwards died of the same : who then at his death is reported to forgive K . Richard 50000 . marks , and sent home the hostages that were with him . And further a certain book entitled Eulogium declareth , that the said Limpoldus duke of Ostrich fell in displeasure with the bishop of Room , and died excommunicate the next year after , Anno 1196 . But thus , as you have herd , Richard the King was ransomed & delivered from the covetous captivity of the Emperor , and returning home made and end of his voyage for Asia , which was both honourable to himself and to all Christian states , but to the Saracens the enemies of Christianitie , terrible and dishonourable . This historic of King Richards voyage to Jerusalem is very excellently and largely written in Latin by Guilielmus Neobrigensis , and Roger Hoveden .
