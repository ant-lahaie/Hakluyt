. They have hospitals for sheep , goats , dogs , cats , birds , & for all other living creatures . When they be old & lame , they keep them until they die . If a man catch or buy any quick thing in other places & bring it thither , they will give him money for it or other victuals , & keep it in their hospitals or let it go . They will give meat to the Ants . Their small money is almonds , which oftentimes they use to eat . From thence I returned to Hugeli , which is the place where the Portugals keep in the country of Bengala which stands in 23 . degrees of Northerly latitude , and stands a league from Satagan : they call it Porto Piqueno . We went through the wilderness , because the right way was full of thieves , where we passed the country of Gouren , where we found but few villages , but almost all wilderness , & saw many buffs , swine & deer , grass longer then a man , and very many Tigers . Not far from Porto Piqueno southwestward , stands and haven which is called Angeli , in the country of Orixa . It was a kingdom of it self , & the king was a great friend to strangers . Afterwards it was taken by the king of Patan which was their neighbour , but he did not enjoy it long , but was taken by Zelabdim Echebar , which is king of Agra , Belli , & Cambaia . Orixa stands 6 . days journey from Satagan , southwestward . In this place is very much Rice , and cloth made of cotton , & great store of cloth which is made of grass , which they call Yerva , it is like a silk . They make good cloth of it which they send for India 8c diverse other places . To this haven of Angeli come every year many ships out of India , Negapatan , Sumatra , Malacca , and diverse other places ;
