are most absent , there is greatest want of heat , and increase of cold ( seeing that cold is nothing but the privation and absence of heat ) and if one cause be wanting , and the other present , the effect will grow indifferent . Therefore this is to be 270 understood , that the nearer any region is to the Equinoctial , the higher the Sun does rise over their heads at noon , and so makes either right or near right Angles , but the Sun tarrieth with them so much the shorter time , and causeth shorter days , with longer and colder nights , to restore the damage of the day past , by reason of the moisture consumed by vapour . But in such regions , over the which the Sun riseth lower ( as in regions extended towards either pole ) it makes there unequal Angles , but the Sun continueth longer , and makes longer days , and causeth so much shorter and warmer nights , as retaining warm vapours of the day past . For there are found by experience Summer Hight nights nights in Scotland and Gothland very hight , when under never tO / ie the Equinoctial they are found very cold . This benefit of the Suns long continuance & increase of the day , does augment so much the more in cold regions as they are nearer the poles , and ceases not increasing until it come directly under the point of the pole Arcticke , where the Sun continueth above ground the space of .. sixe months or half a year together , and so the day ? ' is half a year long , that is the time of the Suns being in the North signs , from the first degree of Aries until the last of Virgo , that is all the time from our io day of March until the 14 of September .
