need no further nor surer argument to clear us of the suspicion of the detracting from your Majesty any part of your just and princely honour and greatness , then the consideration of our own style , which is thus contracted , videlicet , Elizabeth by the grace of God Queen of England , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith etc . which kingdoms and dominions of ours are expressed by these general words , videlicet , England , France , and Ireland : in every of which there are several principalities , dukedoms , earldoms , provinces and countries ' : which being severally expressed would enlarge much our style , and make it of great length ; which by our progenitors hath not be used : notwithstanding , we think it no dishonour to us , compendiously to abridge the same in all our writings and letters written to what Prince , King , or Potentate soever . Whereupon we infer , that holding your Majesties general style , we offer your Highness no dishonour in not expressing all the particular provinces : albeit we can willingly content our self , upon the knowledge of your usages and customs , to observe that course , which your self shall think most honourable . And for the sealing up of our letters which we write to all our allies , kinsmen , and friends , Kings and Princes , we have in use two several seals ; both which we esteem alike honourable , being our princely seals . And as the volume of our letters falls out to be great or small , so accordingly is our greater or lesser seal annexed to the said letters , without esteeming either of them more or less honourable then the other . So as , our most loving and dearest brother , in the said letters there was nothing done of purpose to detract from your Majesty any thing of the usual regard , which our Highness was wont to yield unto your most noble father of famous memory Ivan 425 Basilivich Emperor of all Russia , or to your self , our dearest brother
