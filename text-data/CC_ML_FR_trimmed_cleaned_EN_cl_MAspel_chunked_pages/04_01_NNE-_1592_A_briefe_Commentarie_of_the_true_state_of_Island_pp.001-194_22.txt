unto the skies . For they have no extraordinary height beyond the other mountains of Island , but especially that third mountain , called by Munster Helga , and by us Helgafel , that is the holy mount , standing just by a monastery of the same name , being covered with snow , upon no part thereof in Summer time , neither deserveth it the name of and high mountain , but rather of and humble hillock , never yet ( as I said in the beginning of this section ) so much as once suspected of burning . Neither yet ought perpetuali snow to be ascribed to Hecla only , or to a few others ; for Island hath very many such snowy 108 mountains , all which the Cosmographer ( who hath so extolled and admired these three ) should not easily find out , and reckon up in a whole year . And that also is not to be omitted , that mount Hecla stands not towards the West , as Munster and Ziegler have noted , but between the South and the East : neither is it and headland , but rather a midland hill . Continueth always burning etc . whosoever they be that have ascribed unto Hecla perpetuali belching out of flames , they are far beside the mark : insomuch that as often as it hath be inflamed , our countrymen have recorded it in their yearly Chronicles for a rare The chronicles accident : namely in the years of Christ 1104 , 1157 , Â° fls ^ and - 1222 , 1300 , 1341 , 1362 , and 1389 : For from that year we never herd of the burning of this mountain until the year 1558 , which was the last breaking forth of fire in that mountain . In the mean time I say not that is impossible , but that the bottom of the hill may inwardly breed and nourish flames , which at certain seasons ( as hath be heretofore observed ) have burst out , and perhaps may do the like hereafter .
