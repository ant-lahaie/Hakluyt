A letter of the Company of the Merchants adventurers to Russia unto George Killingworth , Richard Grey , and Henry Lane their Agents there , to be delivered in Colmogro or else where : sent in the John Evangelist . Fter our hearty commendations unto you 1557 . and to either of you : your general letter and other particular letters with two books of the sale and remainders of our goods , and the buying of ware there with you , we received about the end of November out of the Edward , with heavy news of the loss of the said good ship and goods at Petslego in Scotland , with the death of Richard Chancellor and his Boy , with certain of the Ambassadors servants , and he himself with nine of his servants escaped very hardly only by the power of God : but all his goods and ours in manner were lost and pilfered away by the Scots , and that that is saved is not yet come to our hands , but we look for it daily , and it will skant pay the charges for the recovering of it . No remedy but patience : and to pray to God to send us better fortune hereafter . As touching the receiving and entertaining of the Ambassador and his retinewe since his coming to England at the king and Queens Majesties hands , with the Counsel & Lords of this Realm , and the Merchants that be free in Russia with feasting and benevolence given him , we refer it to his report and others . The like we think have not be seen nor showed here of a long time to any Ambassador . The Philip and Marie arrived here tenne days past : she wintered in Norway . The Confidence is lost there . And as for the Bona Esperanza , as yet we have no news of her . We fear it is wrong with her . By your bills of lading received in your general letters we perceive what wares are laden in them both . Your 379 letters have no date nor mention where they were made , which were written by Henry Lane ,
