thick stone walls , and narrow windows like unto Castles : for as they confessed , in time of trouble , by reason of the wild Irish or otherwise , they used their houses for their defence as Castles . The castle and all the houses in the Town , save foure , were wone , burned , and ruinated by the Earl of Desmond . These foure houses fortified themselves against him , and withstood him and all his power perforce , so as he could not win them . There remains yet a thick stone wall that passes overthwart the midst of the street which was a part of their fortification . Notwithstanding whilst they thus defended themselves , as some of them yet alive confessed , they were driven to as great extremities as the Jewes , besieged by Titus the Roman Emperor , insomuch that they were constrained to eat dead men ' s carcases for hunger . The Town is now again somewhat repaired , but in effect there remain but the ruins of the former Town . Commonly they have no chim - neis in their houses , excepting them of the better sort , 27 so that the smoke was very troublesome to us , while we continued there . Their fuel is turfs , which they have very good , and whinnes or furs . There grows little wood thereabouts , which makes building chargeable there : as also want of lime ( as they reported ) which they are feign to fetch from far , when they have need thereof . But of stones there is store enough , so that with them they commonly make their hedges to part each men ground from other ; and the ground seems to be nothing else within but rocks and stones : Yet it is very fruitful and plentiful of grass , and grain , as may appear by the abundance of kine and cattle there : insomuch that we had good muttons ( though somewhat less then ours in England ) for two shillings or five groats a piece , good pigs and hens for 3 . pence a piece .
