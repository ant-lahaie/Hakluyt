Cod fish : we went also seven of us on shore and found there exceeding fair great woods of tall fir trees , and herd and saw store of land and sea fowls , and saw the footing of diverse beasts in the sand when we were on shore . From the Easter end we went to the Norther side of the Island , which we perceived to be but narrow in respect of the length thereof . And after we had searched two days and a night for the Whale ' s which were wounded which we hoped to have found there , and missed of our purpose , we returned back to the South - 164 ward , and were within one league of the Island of Penguin , which lies South from the Eastermost part of Natiscotec some twelve leagues . From the Isle of Penguin we shaped our course for Cape de Rey and had sighed of the Island of Cape Briton : then returned we by the Isles of Saint Pedro , and so came into the Bay of Placentia , and arrived in the Easterside thereof some ten leagues up within the Bay among the fishermen of Saint John de Luz and of Sibiburo and of Biskay , which were to the number of threescore and odd sails , whereof eight ships only were Spaniardes , of whom we were very well used and they wished heartily for peace between them and us . There the men of Saint John and Sibiburo men bestowed two pinnaces on us to make up our voyage with fish . Then we departed over to the other side of the Bay , where we arrived in and harbour which is called Pesmarck , and there made our stage and fished so long , that in the end the Savages came , and in the night , when our men were at rest , cut both our pinnace and our ships boat away to our great hindrance of our voyage , yet it was our good fortune to find out our pinnaces and get them again . Then for fear of a shrewder turn of the Savages , we departed for Cape Saint Marry , and having passed Cape Raz , we passed Northward fourteene leagues and arrived in Farrillon , and finding there two and twentie sails of Englishmen , we made up our fishing voyage to the full in that harbour the twentieth foure of August to our good content : and departing thence we arrived first in Comb and stayed there a seven night , and afterwards in Hungrod in the river of Bristoll by the grace of God the 24 of September . 1594 .
