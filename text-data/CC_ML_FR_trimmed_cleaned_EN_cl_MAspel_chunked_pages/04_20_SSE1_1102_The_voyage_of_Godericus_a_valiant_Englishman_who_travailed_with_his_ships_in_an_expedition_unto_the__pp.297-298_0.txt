Mention made of one Godericus , a valiant Englishman , who was with his ships in the voyage unto the Holy land in the second year of Bald wine King of Jerusalem , in the third year of Henry the first of England . The same in English . BUt seven days afterwards , the King coming out of the town of Assur entered into a ship called a Buss , and one Godericke a pirate of the kingdom of England with him , and fastening his banner on the top of a spear , and holding it up aloft in the air against 297 the beams of the Sun , sailed unto Japhet with a small company ; That the Christian Citizens there seeing this his banner , might conceive hope that the King was yet living , and being not easily terrified with the threats of the enemies might shamefully run away , or be constrained to yield up the city . For he knew that they were very much out of hope of his life and safety . The Saracens seeing and knowing this his banner , that part of them which environed the City by water made towards him with twentie Galleys and thirteene ships , which they commonly call Cazh , seeking to enclose the Kings ship . But , by Gods help the billows of the Sea swelling and raging against them , and the Kings ship gliding and passing through the waves with and easy and nimble course arrived suddenly in the haven of Joppa , the enemies frustrated of their purpose ; and sixe of the Saracens were hurt and wounded by shot out of the Kings ship . So that the King entering into the City , and now appearing in safety in all their sights , the spirits of all them that mourned for him , and until then lamented as though he had be dead , revived , because that the head and King of the Christians , and prince of Jerusalem was yet alive , and come again unto them in perfect health .
