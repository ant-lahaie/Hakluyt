, strong beer , wine , pewter , fox cases , and gold . The Lappians pay tribute to the Emperor of Russia , to the king of Denmarke , and to the king of Sweden . He told me that the River Cola is little more then 20 . leagues to the Southwards of Kegor , where we should have great plenty of salmon , if corn were any thing cheap in Russia : for then poor men would resort thither to kill salmon . The Dutchmen told me that they had made a good year of this , but the Kerils complained of it , because they could not fell all their fish , and that which they sold was as pleased the Dutchmen , and at their own price . I asked the Kerils at what price they sold their fish to the Russes , & they said good cheap : we fell 24 . fish for 4 . altines . I think they sold little above 20 . pence , the 25 . fish this year . The Dutchmen told me that the best stockfish is made at Kegor . I saw at Vasilies tent 7 . or 8 . javelins , and half a dozen of bows bent , with their budgets of arrows , & likewise swords with . other weapons : Otherwise I saw no weapons there . I was also conveyed to their lodgings , which gathered tribute for the king of Denmarke , where I saw a pair of bilboes : and I asked whither they were for the Lappians ( if need were , ) and they said no , but only 374 1557 - for their own company if they should chance to be unruly . The Kerils and the Lappians are not to be trusted , for they will steal as well as the Russes , if they may conveniently come by any thing . Concerning my voyage , because the wind was scant to go back again to Colmogro , I tarried to the Eastwards of the point Kegor , and sent to land , and baked two batches of bred in the ovens that the Kerils have for their provision .
