mists are here already ? Much more here will be , the winter and dark nights being at hand , & we having not so much as a boat to seek out any road to ride in , saving a small weak boat made of men ' s chests , in which it is not convenient to go on shore in a foreign country , where we must go with force : and having but one anchor left us , there is but little hope of life in us , as you may sufficiently judge , if we should loose either the said anchor or our boat , and therefore we dare not put the same in danger for fear of losing them .

And thus doing ( as we shall bound ) even so we will also heartily pray for the continuance of your good estate , and welfare , and for the length of your days , to the pleasure of Almighty God . Lastly , we
