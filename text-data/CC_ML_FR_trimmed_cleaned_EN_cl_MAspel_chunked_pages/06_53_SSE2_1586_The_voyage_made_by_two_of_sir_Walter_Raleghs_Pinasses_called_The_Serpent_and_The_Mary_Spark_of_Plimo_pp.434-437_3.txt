Gallons , the rest were small ships and Caravels all 436 laden with Treasure , spices , and sugars , with which 24 . ships we with two small Pinasses did fight , and kept company the space of 32 . hours , continually fighting with them and they with us , but the two Carracks kept still betwixt the Fleet and us , that we could not take any one of them , so wanting powder , we were forced to give them over against our wills , for that we were all wholly bent to the gaining of some of them , but necessity compelling us , and that only for want of powder , without loss of any of our men , ( which was a thing to be wondered at considering the inequality of number ) at length we gave them over . Thus we again The 2 . pinasses set our course for England , and so came to Plimouth r ‘ tIl ^ for within 6 . hours after our prizes , which we sent away n & an ’ 40 . hours before us , where we were received with triumphant joy , not only with great Ordinance then shot off , but with the willing hearts of all the people of the Town , and of the Country thereabouts ; and we not sparing our Ordinance ( with the powder we had left ) to requite and answer them again . And from thence we brought our prizes to Southampton , where sir Walter Ralegh being our owner , rewarded us with our shares . Our prizes were laden with sugars , Elephants teeth , wax , hides , rice , brazil , and Cuser , as by the testimony of John Evesham himself , Captain Whiddon , Thomas Rainford , Benjamin Wood , William Cooper Master , William Cornish Master , Thomas Drake Corporali , John Ladd gunner , William Warefield gunner , Richard Moon , John Drew , Richard Cooper of Harwich , William Bears of Ratcliffe , John Row of Saltash , and many others , may appear .
