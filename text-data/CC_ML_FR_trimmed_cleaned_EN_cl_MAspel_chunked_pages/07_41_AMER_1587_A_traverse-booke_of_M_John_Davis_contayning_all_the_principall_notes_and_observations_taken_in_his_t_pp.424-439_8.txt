. 434 This day being in the Straights , we had a very quick storm . Being still in the Straight , we had this day fair weather . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ At this present we god clear of the Straights , having coasted the South shore , the land trending from hence S .

Also this 30 of July in the afternoon we crossed over the entrance or mouth of a great inlet or passage , being 20 leagues broad , and situate between 62 & 63 degrees . In which place we had 8 or 9 great rases , currents or overfals , loathsomely crying like the rage of the waters under London bridge , and bending their course into the said gulf . This 31 at noon , coming close by a foreland or great cape , we fell into a mighty raze , where and island of ice was carried by the force of the current as fast as our bark could sail with lum wind , all sails bearing . This cape as it was the most Southerly limit of the gulf which we passed over the 30 day of this month , so was it the North promontory or first beginning of another very great inlet , whose South limit at this present we saw not . Which inlet or gulf this afternoon , and in the night , we passed over : where to our great admiration we saw the sea falling down into the gulf with a mighty overfal , and roaring , and with diverse circular motions like whirlpools , in such sort as forcible streams pass thorough the arches of bridges . The true course , etc . This first of August we fell with the promontory of the said gulf or second passage , having coasted by diverse courses for our safeguard , a great bank of the ice driven out of that gulf .
