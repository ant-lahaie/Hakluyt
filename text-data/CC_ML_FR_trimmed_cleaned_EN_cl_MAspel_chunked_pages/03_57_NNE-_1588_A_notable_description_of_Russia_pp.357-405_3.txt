sandy mould , yet very much different one place from another , for the yield of such things as grow out of the earth . The Country Northwards towards the parts of S . Nicholas and Cola , and Northeast towards Siberia , is all very barren , and full of desert woods by reason of the Climate , and extremity of the cold in Winter time . So likewise along the River Volgha betwixt the Countries ' of Cazan , and Astracan : where ( notwithstanding the soil is very fruitful ! ) it is all unhabited , saving that upon the river Volgha on the Westside , the Emperor hath some few Castles with garrisons in them . This happeneth by means of the Crimme Tartar , that will neither himself plant Towns to dwell there , ( living a wild and vagrant life ) nor suffer the Russe ( that is far off with the strength of his Country ) to people those parts . From Vologda ( which lies almost 1700 . versed from the port of S . Nicholas ) down towards Mosco , and so towards the South part that bordereth upon the Crimme , ( which containeth the like space of 1700 . versed or there about ) is a very fruitful and pleasant Country , yielding pasture , and corn , with woods and waters in very great plenty . The like is betwixt Rezan ( that lies Southeast from Mosco ) to Novogrod and Vobsko , that reach farthest towards the Northwest . So betwixt Mosco , and Smolensko ( that lies Southwest towards Lituania ) is a very fruitful and pleasant soil . The whole Country differeth very much from it self , by reason of the year : so that a man would marveile to see the great alteration and difference betwixt the Winter , and the Summer Russia . The whole 360 Country in the Winter lies under snow , which falls continually , and is sometime of a yard or two thick , but greater towards the North . The Rivers and other waters are all frozen up a yard or more
