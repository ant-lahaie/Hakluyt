Spaniels did hunt the duck . The Thursday I was appointed to way the 300 . kintals gross of Saltpeter , and that afternoon the Tabybe came unto me to my lodging , showing me that the king was offended with John Bampton for diverse causes . The Sunday night late being the 7 . of July , I god the King to forgive all to John Bampton , and the King promised me to speak again with me upon Munday . Upon Tuesday I wrote to him again for my dispatch , and then he sent Fray Lewes to me , and said that he had order to write . Upon Wednesday I wrote again , and he sent me word that upon Thursday I should come and be dispatched , so that I should depart upon Friday without fail , being the twelfth of July . So the friday after according to the kings order & appointment I went to the court , & whereas motion and petition was made for the confirmation of the demands which I had preferred , they were all granted , and likewise the privileges which were on the behalf of our English merchants requested , were with great favour and readiness yielded unto . And whereas the Jewes there resident were to our men in certain round 292 sums indebted , the Emperor ' s pleasure and commandment was , that they should without further excuse or delay , pay and discharge the same . And thus at length I was dismissed with great honour and speciali countenance , such as hath not ordinarily be showed to other Ambassadors of the Christians . And touching the private affairs entreated upon betwixt her Majesty and the Emperor , I had letters from him to satisfy her highness therein . So to conclude , having received the like honourable conduct from his Court , as I had for my part at my first landing , I embarked my self with my foresaid company , and arriving not long after in England , I repaired to her Majesties court , & ended my Ambassage to her highness good liking , with relation of my service performed .
