we called S . Williams Islands , being distant about 20 leagues or more from the Port of Breast . All the coast from the Castles to that place lies East & West , Northeast & Southwest , having between it sundry little Islands , altogether barren and full of stones , without either earth or trees , except certain valleys only . The next day being the 30 of July , we sailed on Westward to find out other Islands which as yet we had not found 12 leagues and a half , among which there is a great Bay towards the North all full of Islands and great creeks where many good harboroughs seem to be : them we nam S .
