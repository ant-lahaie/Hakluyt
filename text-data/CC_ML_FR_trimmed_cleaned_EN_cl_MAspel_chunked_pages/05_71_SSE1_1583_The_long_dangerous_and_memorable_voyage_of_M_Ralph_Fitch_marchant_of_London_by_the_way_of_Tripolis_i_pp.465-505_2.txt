did belong to the kingdom of Persia , but now is subject to the Turke . Over against Babylon there is a very fair village from whence you pass to Babylon upon a long bridge made of boats , and tied to a great chain of iron , which is made fast on either side of the river . When any boats are to pass up or down the river , 466 they take away certain of the boats until they be past . The Tower of Babel is built on this side the river Tygris , towards Arabia from the town about seven or eight miles , which tower is ruinated on all sides , and with the fallen thereof hath made as it were a little mountain , so that it hath no shape at all : it was made of bricks dried in the son , and certain canes and leaves of the palm tree laid betwixt the bricks . There is no entrance to be seen to go into it . It does stand upon a great plain betwixt the rivers of Euphrates and Tygris . By the river Euphrates two days journey from Babylon at a place called Ait , in a field near unto it , is a strange thing to see : a mouth that does continually throw forth against the air boiling pitch with a filthy smoke : which pitch does run abroad into a great field which is always full thereof . The Moors say that it is the mouth of hell . By reason of the great quantity of it , the men of that country do pitch their boats two or three inches thick on the out side , so that no water does enter into them . Their boats be called Danec . A . D . I583 - 9I . The tower of Babel . Boiling pitch continually issuing out of the earth . When there is great store of water in Tygris you may go from Babylon to Basora in 8 or 9 days : if there be small store it will cost you the more days
