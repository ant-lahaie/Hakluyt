bore East by North ofF us , and is 7 . leagues ofF from Sylly . The 29 . day at sixe a clock , beforenoone we had brought the Ramhead North of us , and were within a league of it , and went in Northeast next hand , being thick and foggy , and little wind : so that at eleven a clock we god in within the island , and there by mistaking of a sounding , our ship came aground between the isle and the main , and there sat till 4 . a clock in the afternoon that it was half flood . The 30 . day about 9 . a clock , with much ado I furnished away P . Jeffries , M . Symberbe , and William 201 A . D . 1583 . The isle of Sylly . We came to PUmmouth . Towreson with letters , after dined at M . Blaccollers , and made many salutations with diverse gentlemen . 1583 . The 31 . I wrought aboard all day , and put our ship , and things in order : Afternoon I having pity of some poor men of Milbrooke , which were robbed the night before by a pirate nam Purser , which rid in Cawson bay , I consented to go out with the Edward in company of a small ship which they had furnished to be their Master , so about five of the clock in the afternoon , came a hundreth men of theirs aboard of me : About twelve a clock we set sail , and by three afore day we were got to the windwards of him , then he set sail , and went hence to the Eastwards , and outsailed us , because our consort would not come near him : after a small chase which we gave him to no effect , we returned into our old road , and there moared the ship about nine of the clock in the forenoon , and hence went all the Milbrooke men again ashore from me . And thus I ended a troublesome voyage .
