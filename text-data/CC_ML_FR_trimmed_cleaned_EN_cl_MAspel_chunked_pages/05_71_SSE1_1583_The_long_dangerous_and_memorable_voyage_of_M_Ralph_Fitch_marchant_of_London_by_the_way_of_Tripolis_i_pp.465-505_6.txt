commandeth the bay , and is walled round about . A little above that is the town of the Moors which is governed by a More king called Xa - Maluco . Here is great traffic for all sorts of spices and drug , silk , and cloth of silk , sandals , Elephants teeth , and much China work , and much sugar which is made of the nut called Gagara : the tree is called the palmer : which is the profitablest tree in the world : it does always bear fruit , and does yield wine , oil , sugar , vinegar , cords , coals , of the leaves are made thatch for the houses , sails for ships , mats to fit or lie on : of the branches they make their houses , and brooms to sweep , of the tree wood for ships . The wine doth issue out of the top of the tree . They cut a branch of a bow and bind it hard , and hang and earthen pot upon it , which they empty every morning and every evening , and still it and put in certain dried raisins , and it becomes very strong wine in short time .
