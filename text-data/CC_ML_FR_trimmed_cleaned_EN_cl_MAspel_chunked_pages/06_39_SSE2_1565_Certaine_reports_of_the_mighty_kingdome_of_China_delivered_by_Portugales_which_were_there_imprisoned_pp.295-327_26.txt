China was full of rivers , but now I mind to confirm the same anew : for the farther we went into the Country , the greater we found the rivers . Sometime we were so far off from the sea , that where we came no sea fish had be seen , and salt was there very deer , of fresh water fish yet was there great abundance , and that fish very good : they keep it good after this manner . Where the rivers do meet , and so pass into the sea , there lies great store of boats , specially where no salt - water comes , and that in March and April . These boats are so many that it seems wonderful , ne serve they for other then to take small fish . By the rivers sides they make leyres of fine and strong nets , that lie three handfuls under water , and one above to keep and nourish their fish in , until such time as other fishers do come with boats , bringing for that purpose certain great chests lined with paper , able to hold water , wherein they carry their fish up and down the river , every day renewing the chest with fresh water , and selling their fish in every City , town and village where they pass , unto the people as they need it : most of them have net leyres to keep fish in always for their provision . Where the greater boats cannot pass any further forward , they take lesser , and because the whole Country is very well watered , there is so great plenty of diverse sorts of fish , that it is wonderful to see : assuredly we were amazed to behold the manner of their provision .
