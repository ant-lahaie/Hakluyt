towns , only paying him a tribute , under the government of his Russe Captains . But by their conspiracies & attempts not long after , he was taught to deal more surely with them . And so coming upon them the second time , he killed and carried away with him , three parts of foure , which he gave or sold to the Tartars that served him in those wars , and in stead of them placed there his Russes , so many as might overmatch the rest , with certain garrisons of strength beside . Wherein notwithstanding this oversight was committed , for that ( taking away with him the upland , or country people that should have tilled the ground , & might easily have be kept in order without any danger , by other good policies ) he was driven afterwards many years together , to vitaile the country ( specially the great towns ) out of his own country of Russia , the soil lying there in the mean while wast , and untilled .
