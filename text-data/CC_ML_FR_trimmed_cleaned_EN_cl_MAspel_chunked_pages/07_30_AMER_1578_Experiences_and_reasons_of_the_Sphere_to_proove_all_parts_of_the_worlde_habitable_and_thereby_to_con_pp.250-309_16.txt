Wherefore I conclude , that the blackness proceedeth not of the hotenesse of the Climb , but as I said , of the infection of blood , and therefore this their argument gathered of the African ' s blackness is not able to destroy the temperature of the middle Zone . we may therefore very well be ascertained , 264 that under the Equinoctial is the most pleasant and delectable place of the world to dwell in ; where although the Sun for two hours in a year be direct over their heads , and therefore the heat at that time somewhat of force , yet because it comes so seidome , and continueth so small a time , when it comes , it is not to be weighed , but rather the moderate heat of other Greatest tem - times in all the year to be remembered .
