and other provision , which the Spaniards threw in for that purpose : yet , God be thanked , by the great and diligent foresight of the Master it did not harm at all . In every of the Galleys there were about 200 . soldiers : who together with the shot , spoiled , rend , and battered the Centurion very soar , shot through her main Mast , and slew 4 . of the men in the said ship , the one of them being the Master ' s ' mate . Ten other persons were hurt , by means of splinters which the Spaniards shot : yea , in the end when their provision was almost spent , they were constrained to shoot at them hammers , and the chains from their slaves , and yet God be thanked , they received no more damage : but by spoiling and overwearying of the Spaniards , the Englishmen constrained them to ungrapple themselves , and get them going : and sure if there had be any other fresh ship or succour to have relieved and assisted the Centurion , they had slain , sunk , or taken all those Galleys and their Soldiers . The Dolphin lay a loof off and durst not come near , while the other two small ships fled away , so that one of the Galleys went from the Centurion and set upon the Dolphin , which ship immediately was set on fire with their own powder , whereby both men and ship perished : but whither it was with their good wills or no , that was not known unto the Cen - turion , but sure , if it had come forward , and be and aid unto the Centurion , it is to be supposed that it had not perished . Five hours and a half this fight continued , in which time both were glad to depart only to breath themselves , but when the Spaniards were gone , they never durst return to fight : yet the next day sixe other Galleys came and looked at them , but durst not at any hand meddle with them . Thus God delivered them from the hands of their enemies , and gave them the victory : for which they heartily praised him , and not long after safely arrived in London . There were present at this fight Master John Hawes Merchant , and sundry other of good account .
