A letter of the said M . John Davis written to M . Sanderson of London concerning his forewritten voyage . Ood M . Sanderson , with Gods great mercy I have made my safe return in health , with all my company , and have sailed threescore leagues further then my determination at my departure . I have be in 73 degrees , finding the sea all open , and forty leagues between land and land . The passage is most probable , the execution easy , as at my coming you shall fully know . Yesterday the 15 of September I landed all weary ; therefore I pray you pardon my shortness . Sandridge this 16 of September anno 1587 . Yours equal as mine own , which by trial you shall best know , John Davis .
