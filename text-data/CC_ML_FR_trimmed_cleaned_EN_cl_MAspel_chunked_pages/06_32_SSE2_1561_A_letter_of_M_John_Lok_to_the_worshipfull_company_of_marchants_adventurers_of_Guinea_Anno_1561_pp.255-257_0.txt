A letter of M . John Lok to the worshipful company of Merchants adventurers for Guinie , written 1561 , showing reasons for his not proceeding in a voyage then intended to the foresaid country . Orshipfull sirs ; since the arrival of M . Pet and Buttoil Monjoy ( as I understand ) for the voyage it is concluded that the Minion shall proceed on her voyage , if within 20 days she may be repaired of those hurts she hath received by the last storm : or in the month of January also , if the wind will serve therefore . Wherefore for that your worships shall not be ignorant of my determined purpose in the same , with the reasons that have persuaded me thereunto ; I have thought good to advertise you thereof , trusting that your worships will weigh them , as I uprightly and plainly mean them . And not for any fear or discouragement that I have of my self by the raging of the storms of the sea , for that ( I thank the Lord ) these have not been the first that I have abiden , neither trust I they shall the last . First the state of the ship , in which , though I think not but M .

For though that at Harwich she was both bound and caulked as much as might be , both within and without , yet for all that she left not , afore this flaw , in other weathers , being stressed , to open those seams , and become in the state she was before ; I mean , in wetting her men : notwithstanding her new work . And my judgement , with that
