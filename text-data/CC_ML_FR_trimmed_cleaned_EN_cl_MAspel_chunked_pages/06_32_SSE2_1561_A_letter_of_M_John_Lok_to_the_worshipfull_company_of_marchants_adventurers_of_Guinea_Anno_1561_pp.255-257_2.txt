worships might understand the whole cause why I do not proceed , I have troubled you at this time with this my long Letter . And , as God is my Judge , not for fear of the Portugals , which there we shall meet ( and yet alone without aid ) as here is a ship which was in Lisbon , whose men say that there are in a readiness ( only to meet us ) foure great ships , of 2s6 the which one is accounted 700 tons , & other pinnaces : yet not for fear of them , nor raging of the seas ( whose rage God is above to rule ) but only for the premises : the sequel whereof must by reason turn to a great [ II ii . 54 . ] misery to the men : the which I for my part ( though it might turn me to as much gain as the whole comes to ) yet would I not be so tormented , as the sighed thereof would be a corrosive to my heart , and the more , because foreseeing the same , I should be so lewd , as yielding , to have run into the danger thereof , and therefore I have absolutely determined with my self not to go this voyage . Howbeit if in a seasonable time of the year I had but one ship sufficient , though much less by the half , I would not refuse ( as trial being made thereof should appear ) or if I had ability of my self to venture so much , it should well be seen . And this I speak to give you to understand that I refuse not this for fear : If you purpose to proceed herein , send some one whom you please ; to whom I will not only deliver the articles which I have received , but also will give some particular notes which I have noted in the affairs which you have committed unto me , with the best help and counsel I can . Thus the living God keep your worships all . Bristoll this 11 of December 1561 . Your worships to command to his power John Lok .
