Mattel in the 25 leagues , whither we were determined to go upon intelligence we had of a Portugal , ( during our abided in S . Johns ) who was himself present , when the Portugals ( above thirty years passed ) did put into the same Island both Neat and Swine to breed , which were since exceedingly multiplied . This seemed unto us very happy tidings , to have in and Island lying so near unto the main , which we intended to plant upon , such store of cattle , whereby we might at all times conveniently be relieved of victuali , and served of store for breed . In this course we trended along the coast , which from Cape Raze stretcheth into the Northwest , making a bay which some called Trepassa . Then it goes out again towards the West , and makes a point , which with Cape Raze lies in manner East and West . But this point inclineth to the North : to the West of which goes in the bay of Placentia . We sent men on land to take view of the soil along this coast , whereof they made good Good soil . report , and some of them had will to be planted there . They saw Pease growing in great abundance every where . The distance between Cape Raze and Cape Briton is 87 leagues . In which Navigation we spent 8 days , having many times the wind indifferent good : yet could we never attain sighed of any land all that time , seeing we were hindered by the current . At last we fell into such flats and dangers , that hardly any of us escaped : where nevertheless we lost our Admiral with all the men and provision , not knowing certainly the place . Yet for inducing men of skill to make conjecture , by our course and way we held from Cape Raze thither ( that thereby the flats and dangers may be inserted in sea Cards , for warning to others that may follow the same course hereafter ) I have set down the best reckonings that were kept by expert men , William Cox Master of the Hind , and John Paul his mate , both of Limehouse .
