in reals of plate and gold , and employ it here in this river in commodities : and when here are no commodities to be had for money in this place , then these merchant ' s of Peru are constrained to go to Baia and Fernambuc , and there to employ their money . I would I had brought good store of silks , and not these kind of commodities which I did bring . For here is more profit to be had a great deal then in the voyage of Angola . For here with five hundred ducats in five months space a man may get sixe thousand ducats . And this is no fable , but most true , and a great deal more then I can express . For a rapier which doth cost in Spaine foure and twenty and sixe and twenty reals , is sold here for forty and fifty ducats : a bridle for a horse is sold for fifteene ducats : a lock of a door and the key is sold for ten ducats : a pound of benjamin is sold for fifteene ducats : a yard of velvet is sold for twenty and five and twenty ducats : taffataes are sold for sixe and seven ducats the vare : and ounce of musk is sold for forty ducats : and all kind of commodities after this rate . So one 41 A . D . 1596 . The shortness of the retume of the voyage to Peru . This rich trade was begun in the year 1595 . The voyage of Angola in Africa . Gain often thousand ducats for the laying out of one thousand . A trade of buying Negroes in Angola . Broad cloth excellently well sold . Vinegar . Olives . Taffataes . Velvets . thousand ducats of Spanish commodities will gain tenne thousand ducats . Thus I hope in God to make more profit and gain this voyage , then in two voyages to Angola : for I have sold most of my hats for two ducats and a half and for three ducats . The rest I will carry to Angola , to help to fell the rest of my commodities , which I cannot fell in this river . And I have sold and hundred cubits of broad cloth for five hundred and five hundred and fifty and sixe hundred reys the cubit . If I would have sold all my cloth for ready money
