little made something , and learned not only the manners , conditions 8c customs of the people , but also he learned of all kind of commodities in those regions how they may be bought at the most advantage , that gain may 198 be made of them : So that I confess , if he hath given intelligence to the right Wor . company , then have they no need to speak with me or any other for to learn of those countries ( except it be to hear mine opinion ) which in truth I will always open unto them .

Therefore if they will maintain Lappia , others the Russia trade with advantage , then ought they to toil prevent look to this in time , and so may they keep the Russia trade as it is , and likewise make a trade in Lappia more profitable then that , and therefore this is to be considered , rather then to prohibit Englishmen from The trade of the trade of Vedagoba .
