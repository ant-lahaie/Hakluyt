- l between our Emperors Majesty , and your Queens Majesty , their love and amity may not be separated at any time , but to continue : and you request me that I should be good unto the English merchant ' s , and to defend them from all such domages hereafter : your honours loving letter I have therein thoroughly considered : and as I have be heretofore , so I will still continue to be a mean betwixt our Lord and kings Majesty , and your great Lady the Queen her highness , for the maintaining of brotherly love and amity , most joyfully and willingly , as God knoweth , aswell hereafter as I have be heretofore : praying you to do the like also . Mine only desire is for your most excellent Princess sake , to do all that lies in me for the aiding , helping and protecting of her Majesties merchant ' s , by the order and commandment of our Lord and king his Majesty . 437 And to that end , I have given order to all our authorised people to be careful over them , and to defend them in all causes , and to give them free liberty to traffic at their own wills and pleasures . It may be that your merchant ' s do not certify you the truth of all things , nor make known unto your honour my readiness to protect them : And how my Letters and Commissions are sent to all authorised people for them , that they should aid and assist them according to the tenor or my Letters , to all others that be in authority under the said Officers or otherwise . Also your honour writeth of the debarring of your merchant ' s at the Sea port from their accustomed liberty of interchangeable traffic and bartar . Touching which complaint search and inquisition hath be made , and commandment given , that your Queens Majesties merchant ' s at the Seaside , and in all places where the trade is , do not sustain any damage or hindrance hereafter , but that they shall at liberty without any hindering or letting , either in the Mosco , the Treasurehouse , or else where by any of our authorised people , but absolutely to be at free liberty at their own will and pleasure . And also I will continue to be their protector and defendor in all causes , by our Lord and kings Majesties order and commandment : as it shall known and certified you by your people resident here in the Mosco . Written in our Kings Majesties royal city of Mosco from the beginning of the world 7101 . year , in the month of January .
