defences , and to cast earth out of the ditches , and in all works they were necessary at our needs . How the great Turke arrived in person before Rhodes . THe 25 day of the said month many of our men went out for to skirmish in the field and made great murder of Turks , and in likewise did our artillery . And it is to be noted that the 28 day of the same month the great Turke in person passed le Fisco a haven in the main land with a galley and a fust , and arrived about noon , where his army lay , the which day may be called unhappy for Rhodes . For his coming , his presence and continual abiding in the field is and hath been cause of the victory that he hath had . When the galley that he came in was arrived , all the other ships of the host hanged banners aloft in their tops and on their sail yards . Soon after that the Turke was arrived , he went to land , and mounted on his horse , and road to his pavilion which was in a high place called Megalandra , foure or five miles from the town out of the danger of the gun shot . And on the morrow , as it was reported to us , he came to a Church nigh the town called Saint Steven , for to view the Town and fortresses , whereas they had set up mantellets for to lay their ordinance . THe last day of July , one of our brigandines went out with a good company of men arrayed as Turkes , and some of them could speak Turkish , and went by night to land through the Turkes host , and demanded 21 if there were any that would pass over into Turkey , that they should haste them to come . The Turkes weening that they had been of Turkey , there entered a 12 . persons , the which were carried to Rhodes , by whom we knew what they did in the camp .
