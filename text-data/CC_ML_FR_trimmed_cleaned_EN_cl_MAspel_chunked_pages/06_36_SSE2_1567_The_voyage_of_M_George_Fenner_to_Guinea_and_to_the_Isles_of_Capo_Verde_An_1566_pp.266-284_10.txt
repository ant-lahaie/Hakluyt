The last day of Januarie our general with certain of his men went a shore in the Bay to the houses , where he found 12 Portugals . In all the Island there were not Banished above 30 persons , which were banished men for a time , Portu & a ^- some for more years , some for less , and among them there was one simple man which was their captain . They live upon goats flesh , cocks , hens , and fresh water : other victuals they have none , saving fish , which they esteem not , neither have they any boats to take them . They reported that this Island was given by the king of Portugall to one of his gentlemen , who hath let it forth to rend for one hundreth ducats a year , which rend is reared only in goats skins . For by their Great steer of speeches there hath be sent forth of the said Island SPates - into Portugall 40000 skins in one year . We were to these men marvelously welcome , and to their powers very well entertained , and they gave us the flesh of as many hee - goates as we would have , and took much pains for us in taking them , and bringing them from the mountains upon their asses . They have there great store of the oil of Tortoises , which Tortoise is a fish which swimmeth in the Sea , with a shell on his back as broad as a target . It rains not in this Island but in three months of the year , from the midst of July to the midst of October , and it is here always very hight . Kine have be brought hither , but by reason of the heat and drought they have died . The 3 of February we departed from this Island , and the same day fell with another Island called the Island of The lie of Maiyo , which is 14 leagues from the other Island : there hois in the midst of the way between these two Hands a danger which is always to be seen . We anchored
