Islands there is a large entrance or straight , called Frobishers straight , after the name of our general , the first finder thereof . This strni said straight is supposed to have passage into the sea of Sur , which I leave unknown as yet . It seems that either here , or not far hence , the sea should have more large entrance , then in other parts within the frozen or untemperate Zone : and that some contrary tide , either from the East or West , with main force casts out that great quantity of ice , which comes floating from this coast , even unto Friseland , causing that Country to seem more untemperate then others , much more Northerly then the same .

Before we came within the making of these lands we tasted cold storms , in so much that it seemed we had changed summer with winter , if the length of the days had not removed us from that opinion .
