. at the least , being ( in our judgement ) about 10000 . tons of shipping . There were in sighed of us at Porto Real about 40 . ships , beside those that fled from Cadiz . We found little ease during our abode there , by reason of their continual shooting from the Galleys , the fortresses , and from the shore : where continually at places convenient they planted new ordinance to offend us with : beside the inconvenience which we suffered from their ships , which , when they could defend no longer , they set on fire to come among us . Whereupon when the flood came we were not a little troubled to defend us from their terrible fire , which nevertheless was a pleasant sighed for us to behold , because we were thereby eased of a great labour , which lay upon us day and night , in discharging the victuals , and other provisions of the enemy . Thus by the assistance of the Almighty , and the invincible courage and industry of our general , this strange and happy enterprise was achieved in one day and two nights , to the great astonishment of the King of Spaine , which bred such a corrasive in the heart of the Marks of Santa Cruz high Admiral of Spaine , that he never enjoyed good day after , but within few months ( as may justly be supposed ) died of extreme grief and sorrow . Thus having performed this notable service , we came out of the Road of Cadiz on the Friday morning the 440 21 . of the said month of April , with very small loss not worth the mentioning . After our departure ten of the Galleys that were in the Road came out , as it were in disdain of us , to make some pastime with their ordinance , at which time the wind skanted upon us , whereupon we cast about again , and stood in with the shore , & came to anchor within a league of the town ; where the said Galleys , for all their former bragging , at length suffered us to ride quietly We now have had experience of Galley - fight : wherein I can assure you , that only these 4 . of her Majesties ships will make no account of 20 . Galleys , if they may be alone , and not busied to guard others
