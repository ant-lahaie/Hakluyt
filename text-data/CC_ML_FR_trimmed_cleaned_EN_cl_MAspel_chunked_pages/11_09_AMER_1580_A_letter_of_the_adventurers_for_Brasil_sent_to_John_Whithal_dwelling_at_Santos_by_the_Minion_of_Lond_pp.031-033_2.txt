A . D . 1580 . we have sent you copper cauldrons for your Ingenios , with iron and all other necessaries for your purpose , and artificers to set the same : and as we have at your request be at great charges in sending these men , so we pray you let us have lawful favour in like courtesy to further all our causes . And if any of our Mariners or passengers in any respect of displeasure against their company , or in hope of preferment of marriage or otherwise would procure to tarry and dwell there , and leave his charge and office , that then you will be a mean to the Justice that such fugitives should be sent aboard the ship as prisoners : for as you know , without our men we cannot bring home our ship . we have given order to our factors to use your counsel and help in their affairs , and to gratify you for the same as to your courtesy and faithful friendship shall appertain to your good liking : and in the mean time for a token of our good wills towards you , we have sent you a fieldbed of walnut tree , with the canopy , valens , curtains , and gilded knops . And if there be any commodity else that may pleasure you or your friends , we have given order that they shall have the refusing of it before any other , giving for it as it is worth . And thus to conclude , promising to perform all the foresaid things on our parts in every condition , we commit you to God , who ever preserve you with all his blessings .
