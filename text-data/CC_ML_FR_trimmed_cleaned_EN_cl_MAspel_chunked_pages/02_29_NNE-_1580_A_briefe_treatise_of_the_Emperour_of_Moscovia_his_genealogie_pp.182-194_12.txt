any affinity either with the Moscovian tongue , or with the tongues of any other nations . But whereas the Mosco - II 193 n vite pretendeth that there hath been usually paid a pension or tribute unto himself and his predecessors out of the whole province , it is as incredible as the former .. About the beginning of this tragical war , the Moscovite , to cloak his tyranny and ambition under some fair pretense , among other of his demands , made mention also of a tribute which should be due unto him out of the bishop of Dorpat his jurisdiction , whereof notwithstanding he could neither bring any just account , nor affirm any certainty : howbeit there is no man living to be found which either can tell of his own remembrance , or from the relation of others , that any such tribute was ever paid unto the Moscovite . What time therefore he referred all this negotiation unto the master of the Livonian order , and commanded him to get what knowledge he could thereof from the men of Dorpat , & urged the tribute , saying if it were worth but one hair , that he would not remit it : at length it was found recorded in the ancient Chronicles of Dorpat , that beyond the memory of man , when the territory of Plesco contained nothing but woods and forests for wild beasts , that the peasants of the liberty of Dorpat called Neuhus , by the consent of the Russian borderers , enjoyed Beehives in the said woods , and paid every year in lieu thereof unto the Russian governors , sixe shillings of Livonian coin . But so soon as the Russians had felled the woods and had built towns and villages in their place , the said pension ceased together with the trees which were cut down . Wherefore the said sixe shillings were never since that time either demanded by the Russes or paid by the Livonians . These things which I knew concerning the causes of the Livonian wars I thought good to signify unto you . Given the 22 . of May , in the year of our Lord 1576 .
