Here therefore we remained two days with great authority ; and considering that we Iconitmin cou ^ attempt nought against the city of Iconium , having tended have ost our warlike engines both for defence and for bene besieged , battery , for that the oxen which drew them were slain with the enemies weapons , falling as thick as hailstones : and also for because all our beasts in a manner were most grievously diseased ; our majesty Imperial accepted of the Sultans petition , league , and oath being made and taken under our ensigns , and granted our peace unto him . Then returned we into our own dominions , being greatly grieved for the loss of our deer kinsmen , and yielding unto God most humble 318 1190 . thanks , who of his goodness had even now given us the victory . We are right glad likewise that some of your Certaim noble majesties princes and nobles accompanied us in this mtnofthektng actium , who are able to report unto you all things which fa have happened . And albeit we were exceedingly grieved Emperor in for the loss of our people ; yet thought it we expedient his battle to signify unto you the success of our affairs , as unto gfl ^ tthe & ol - our well - beloved friend , & one who is very nearly allied anoflcmwm - unto our highness Imperial , by reason of the consanguinity of our children .
