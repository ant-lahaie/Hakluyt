A report of Master John Davis of his three Voyages made for the discovery of thee Northwest passage , taken out of a Treatise of his , Entitled the world's Hydrographical description . 
 The 1. voyage . 
 Owe there only rests the North parts of America , upon which coast my self have had most experience of any in our age : for thrice I was that way employed for the discovery of this notable passage , by the honourable care and some charge of Sir Francis Walsingham knight , princi 
 pali secretary to her Majesty , with whom diverse noble men and worshipful merchants of London joined in purse and willingness for the furtherance of that attempt , but when his honour died the voyage was friendless , and men's minds alienated from adventuring therein . 
 In my first voyage not experienced of the nature of those climates , and having no direction either by Chart , Globe , or other certain relation in what altitude that passage was to be searched , I shaped a Northerly course and so sought the same towards the South , and in that my Northerly course I fell upon the shore which in ancient time was called Greenland , five hundred leagues distant from the Durseys Westnorthwest Northerly , the land being very high and full of mighty mountains all covered with snow , no view of wood , grass or earth to be seen , and the shore two leagues ofF into the sea so full of ice as that not shipping could by any means come near the same . The loathsome view of the shore , and irksome noise of the ice was such , as that it bred strange conceits among us , so that we supposed the place to be wast and void of any sensible or vegetable creatures , whereupon I called the same Desolation : so coasting this shore towards the South in the latitude of sixtie degrees , I 440 
 found it to trend towards the West , I still followed the leading thereof in the same height , and after fifty or sixtie leagues it failed and lay directly North , which I still followed , and in thirtie leagues sailing upon the West side of this coast by me nam Desolation , we were passed all the ice and found many green & pleasant Isles bordering upon the shore , but the hills of the main were still covered with great quantities of snow , I brought my ship among those Isles and there mored to refresh our selves in our weary travel , in the latitude of sixtie foure degrees or there about . The people of the country having espied our ships came down unto us in their Canoas , & holding up their right hand to the Sun and crying Yliaout , would strike their breasts : we doing the like the people came aboard our ships , men of good stature , unbearded , small eyed and of tractable conditions , by whom as signs would permit , we understood that towards the North and West there was a great sea , and using the people with kindness in giving them nails and knives which of all things they most desired , we departed , and finding the sea free from ice supposing our selves to be passed all danger we shaped our course Westnorthwest thinking thereby to pass for China , but in the latitude of sixtie sixe degrees we fell with another shore , and there found another passage of twenty leagues broad directly West into the same , which we supposed to be our hoped straight , we entered into the same thirty or fortie leagues , finding it neither to wyden nor straighten , then considering that the year was spent ( for this was the fine of August ) not knowing the length of the straight and dangers thereof , we took it our best course to return with notice of our good success for this small time of search . And so returning in a sharp fret of Westerly winds the 29. of September we arrived at Dartmouth . And acquainting master Secretary Walsingham with the rest of the honourable and worshipful adventurers of all our proceedings , I was appointed again the second year to search the bottom of this straight ,

 because by all likelihood it was the place and passage by The z . voyage , us laboured for . In this second attempt the marcnants of Exeter , and other places of the West became adventurers in the actium , so that being sufficiently furnished for sixe months , and having direction to search these straights , until we found the same to fallen into another sea upon the West side of this part of America , we should again return : for then it was not to be doubted , but shipping with trade might safely be conveyed to China , and the parts of Asia . We departed from Dartmouth , and arriving upon the South part of the coast of Desolation coasted the same upon his West shore to the latitude of sixetie sixe degrees , and there anchored among the Isles bordering upon the same , where we refreshed our selves , the people of this place came likewise unto us , by whom I understood through their signs that towards the North the sea was large . At this place the chief ship whereupon I trusted , called the Mermaid of Dartmouth , found many occasions of discontentment , and being unwilling to proceed , she there forsook me . Then considering how I had given my faith and most constant promise to my worshipful good friend master William Sanderson , who of all men was the greatest adventurer in that actium , and took such care for the performance thereof , that he hath to my knowledge at one time disbursed as much money as any five others whatsoever , out of his own purse , when some of the company have be slack in giving in their adventure : And also knowing that I should lose the favour of M. Secretary Walsingham , if I should shrink from his direction ; in one small bark of 30 Tons , whereof M. Sanderson was owner , alone without farther company I proceeded on my voyage , and arriving at these straights followed the same 80. leagues , until I came among many Islands , where the water did ebb and flow sixe fathom upright , and where there had be great trade of people to make train . But by such things as there we found , we knew that they were not Christians of Europe that had used 
 442 
 that trade : in fine by searching with our boat , we found small hope to pass any farther that way , and therefore recovered the sea and coasted the shore towards the South , and in so doing ( for it was too late to search towards the North ) we found another great inlet near 40 leagues broad , where the water entered in with violent swiftness , this we also thought might be a passage : for no doubt the North parts of America are all Islands by North ought that I could perceive therein : but because I was ali alone in a small bark of thirtie tons , and the year jsian^ â€™ spent , I entered not into the same , for it was now the seventh of September , but coasting the shore towards the South we saw and incredible number of birds : having diverse fishermen aboard our bark they all concluded that there was a great skull of fish , we being unprovided of fishing furniture with a long spike nail made a hook , and fastened the same to one of our sounding lines , before the bait was changed we took more then fortie great Cods , the fish swimming so abundantly thick about our bark as is incredible to be reported , of which with a small portion of salt that we had , we preserved some thirtie couple , or thereabouts , and so returned for England . And having reported to M. Secretary Walsingham the whole success of this attempt , he commanded me to present unto the most honourable Lord high Treasurer of England , some part of that fish : which when his Lordship saw , & herd at large the relation of this second attempt , I received favourable countenance from his honour , advising me to prosecute the actium , of which his Lordship conceived a very good opinion . The next year , although diverse of the adventurers fell from the Actium , as all the Western merchants , and most of those in London : yet some of the adventurers both honourable & worshipful continued their willing favour and charge , so that by this means the next year two ships were appointed for the fishing and one pinnace for the discovery . 
 Departing from Dartmouth , through Gods merciful The ^ . voyage . 443 
 favour , I arrived at the place of fishing , and there according to my direction I left the two ships to follow that business , taking their faithful promise not to depart until my return unto them , which should be in the fine of August , and so in the bark I proceeded for the discovery : but after my departure , in sixeteene days the two ships had finished their voyage , and so presently departed for England , without regard of their promise : my self not distrusting any such hard measure proceeded for the discovery , and followed my course in the free and open sea between North and Northwest to the latitude of 67 degrees , and there I might see America West from me , and Gronland , which I called Desolation , East : then when I saw the land of both sides I began to distrust it would prove but a gulf : notwithstanding desirous to know the full certainty I proceeded , and in 68 degrees the passage enlarged , so that I could not see the Western shore : thus I continued to the latitude of 73 degrees , in a great sea , free from ice , coasting the Western shore of Desolation : the people came continually rowing out unto me in their Canoas , twenty , forty , and one hundred at a time , and would give me fish dried , Salmon , Salmon peal , Cod , Caplin , Lump , Stone-base and such like , beside diverse kinds of birds , as Partridge , Pheasant , Gulls , Sea birds and other kinds of flesh : I still laboured by signs to know from them what they knew of any sea towards the North , they still made signs of a great sea as we understood them , then I departed from that coast , thinking to discover the North parts of America : & after I had sailed towards the West 40 leagues , I fell upon a great bank of ice : the wind being North and blue much , I was constrained to coast the same towards the South , not seeing any shore West from me , neither was there any ice towards the North , but a great sea , free , large very salt and blue , & of and unsearchable depth : So coasting towards the South I came to the place where I left the ships to fish , but found them not . Then being forsaken & left in this distress referring my self to the merciful providence of God , I shaped my course for England , & unhoped for of any , God alone relieving me , I arrived at Dartmouth . By this last discovery it seemed most manifest that the passage was free & without impediment towards the North : but by reason of the Spanish fleet & unfortunate time of M. Secretary's death , the voyage was omitted & never since attempted . The cause why I use this particular relation of all my proceedings for this discovery , is to stay this objection , why hath not Davis discovered this passage being thrice that ways employed ? How far I proceeded & in what form this discovery lies , does appear upon the Globe which M. Sanderson to his very great charge hath published , for the which he deserveth great favour & commendations .
