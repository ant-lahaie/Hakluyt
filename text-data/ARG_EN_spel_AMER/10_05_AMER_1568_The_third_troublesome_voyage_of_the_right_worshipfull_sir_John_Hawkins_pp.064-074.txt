The third troublesome voyage made with the Jesus of Lubeck , the Minion , and foure other ships , to the parts of Guinea , and the West Indies , in the years 1567 and 1568 by M. John Hawkins .

 and the Jesus our chief ship , in such case , as not thought able to serve the voyage : whereupon in the same storm we set our course homeward , determining to give over the voyage : but the eleventh day of the same month , the wind changed with fair weather , whereby we were animated to foil owe our enterprise , and so did , directing our course with the Hands of the Canaries , where according to and order before prescribed , all our ships before dispersed , met at one of those Hands , called Gomera , where we took water , and departed from thence the fourth day of November , towards the coast of Guinea , and arrived at Cape Verde , the eighteenth of November : where we landed 150 men , hoping to obtain some Negroes , where we god but few , and those with great hurt and damage to our men , which chiefly proceeded of their envenomed arrows : and although in the beginning they seemed to be but small hurts , yet there hardly escaped any that had blood drawn of them , but died in strange sort , with their mouths shut some tenne days before they died , and after their wounds were whole ; where I my self had one of the greatest 64 
 1567. wounds , yet thanks be to God , escaped . From thence we passed the time upon the coast of Guinea , searching with all diligence the rivers from Rio Grande , unto Sierra Leona , till the twelfth of Januarie , in which time we had not got together a hundreth and fiftie Negroes : yet notwithstanding the sickness of our men , and the late time of the year come - manded us away : and thus having nothing wherewith to seek the coast of the West Indias , I was with the rest of our company in consultation to go to the coast of the Mine , hoping there to have obtained some gold for our wares , and thereby to have defrayed our charge . But even in that present instant , there came to us a Negro , sent from a king , oppressed by other Kings his neighbours , desiring our aid , with promise that as many Negroes as by these wars might be obtained , aswell of his part as of ours , should be at our pleasure : whereupon we concluded to give aid , and sent 120 of our men , which the 15 of Januarie , assaulted a town of the Negroes of our town of Allies adversaries , which had in it 8000 Inhabitants , 8°°° ” * 8 ™ being very strongly impaled and fenced after their ' manner , but it was so well defended , that our men prevailed not , but lost sixe men and fortie hurt : so that our men sent forthwith to me for more help : whereupon considering that the good success of this enterprise might highly further the commodity of our voyage , I went my self , and with the help of the king of our side , assaulted the town , both by land and sea , and very hardly with fire ( their houses being covered with dry Palm leaves ) obtained the town , put the Inhabitants to flight , where we took 250 persons , men , women , & children , and by our friend the king of our side , there were taken 600 prisoners , whereof we hoped to have had our choice : but the 
 Negro ( in which nation is seidome or never found 5 in truth ) meant nothing less : for that night he re - Negroes . moved his camp and prisoners , so that we were

 feign to content us with those few which we had got our selves . 
 Now had we obtained between foure and five hundred Negroes , wherewith we thought it somewhat reasonable to seek the coast of the West Indies , and there , for our Negroes , and other our merchandise , we hoped to obtain , whereof to countervail our charges with some gains , whereunto we proceeded with all diligence , furnished our watering , took fuel , and departed the coast of Guinea the third of Februarie , continuing at the sea with a passage more hard , then before hath be accustomed till the 27 day of March , which day we had sighed of and Hand , called Dominica , upon the coast of the West Indies , in fourteene degrees : from thence we coasted from place to place , making our traifike with the Spaniards as we might , somewhat hardly , because the king had straightly commanded all his Governors in those parts , by no means to suffer any trade to be made with us : notwithstanding we had reasonable trade , and courteous entertainment , from the He of Margarita unto Cartagena , without any thing greatly worth the noting , saving at Capo de la Vela , in a town called Rio de la Hacha ( from whence come all the pearls ) the treasurer who had the charge there , would by no means agree to any trade , or suffer us to take water , he had fortified his town with diverse bulwarks in all places where it might be entered , and furnished himself with and hundred Harquebusiers , so that he thought by famine to have enforced us to have put a land our Negroes : of which purpose he had not greatly failed , unless we had by force entered the town : which ( after we could by no means obtain his favour ) we were inforced to do , and so with two hundred men brake in upon their bulwarks , and entered the town with the loss only of two men of our parts , and no hurt done to the Spaniards because after their voley of shot discharged , they all fled . 
 Thus having the town with some circumstance , as 66 
 partly by the Spaniards desire of Negroes , and partly by friendship of the Treasurer , we obtained a secret trade : whereupon the Spaniards resorted to us by night , and bought of us to the number of 200 Negroes : in all other places where we traded the Spaniards inhabitants were glad of us and traded willingly . 
 At Cartagena the last town we thought to have Cartagena . seen on the coast , we could by no means obtain to deal with any Spaniard , the governor was so straight , and because our trade was so near finished we thought not good either to adventure any landing , or to detract further time , but in peace departed from thence the 24 of July , hoping to have escaped the time of their storms which then soon after began to reign , the which they call Furicanos , but passing by the West Furicanos . end of Cuba , towards the coast of Florida there happened to us the 12 day of August and extreme storm which continued by the space of foure days , which so beatrice the Jesus , that we cut down all her higher buildings , her rudder also was soar shaken , and withal was in so extreme a leak that we were rather upon the point to leave her then to keep her any longer , yet hoping to bring all to good pass , we sought the coast of Florida , where we found no place nor Haven for our ships , because of the shalownesse of the coast : thus being in greater despair , and taken with a new storm Storm . which continued other 3 days , we were enforced to take for our succour the Port which serves the city of Mexico called Saint John de Ullua , which stands in 19 degrees : in seeking of which Port we took in our way 3 ships which carried passengers to the number of and hundred , which passengers we hoped should be a mean to us the better to obtain victuals for our money , Sc a quiet place for the repairing of our fleet . 
 Shortly after this the 16 of September we entered the [ I3J - 523d Port of Saint John de Ullua and in our entry the °a Spaniardes thinking us to be the fleet of Spaine , the chief officers of the Country came aboard us , which 
 The Spaniards being deceived of their expectation were greatly disdeceived . mayed : but immediately when they saw our demand was nothing but victuals , were recomforted . I found also in the same Port twelve ships which had in them by report two hundred thousand pound in gold & silver , all which ( being in my possession , with the kings Hand as also the passengers before in my way thitherward stayed ) I set at liberty , without the taking from them the weight of a groat : only because I would not be delayed of my dispatch , I stayed two men of estimation and sent post immediately to Mexico , which was two hundred miles from us , to the Presidents and Councell there , showing them of our arrival there by the force of weather , and the necessity of the repair of our Our requests , ships and victuals , which wants we required as friends to king Philip to be furnished of for our money : and that the Presidents and Councell there should with all convenient speed take order , that at the arrival of the Spanish fleet , which was daily looked for , there might not cause of quarrel rise between us and them , but for the better maintenance of amity , their commandment might be had in that behalf . This message being sent away the sixteenth day of September at night , being the very day of our arrival , in the next morning which was the seventeenth day of the same month , we saw open of the Haven thirteene great ships , The fleet of and understanding them to be the fleet of Spaine , I Spaine . sent immediately to advertise the general of the fleet of my being there , doing him to understand , that before I would suffer them to enter the Port , there should some order of conditions pass between us for our safe being there , and maintenance of peace . Now it is to The manner be understood that this Port is made by a little Hand stones not three foot above the water in the highest one ua . piace , and ( j but a bow-shoot of length any way , this Hand stands from the main land two bow shoots or more , also it is to be understood that there is not in all this coast any other place for ships to arrive in safety , 68 
 because the North wind hath there such violence , that unless the ships be very safely mored with their anchors fastened upon this Hand , there is no remedy for these North winds but death : also the place of North winds the Haven was so little , that of necessity the ships must ride one aboard the other , so that we could not give place to them , nor they to us : and here I began to bewail that which after followed , for now , said I , I am in two dangers , and forced to receive the one of them . That was , either I must have kept out the fleet from entering the Port , the which with Gods help I was very well able to do , or else suffer them to enter in with their accustomed treason , which they never fade to execute , where they may have opportunity , to compass it by any means : if I had kept them out , then had there be present shipwreck of all the fleet which amounted in valve to sixe Millions , which was in valve of our money 1800000. li . which I considered i8ooz&w*W I was not able to answer , fearing the Queens Majesties Poundindignation in so weighty a matter . Thus with my self revolving the doubts , I thought rather better to abide the Jutt of the uncertainty , then the certain tie . 
 The uncertain doubt I account was their treason which by good policy I hoped might be prevented , and therefore as choosing the least mischief I proceeded to conditions . Now was our first messenger come and returned from the fleet with report of the arrival of a Viceroy , so that he had authority , both in all this A Viceroy . Province of Mexico ( otherwise called Nueva Espanna ) and in the sea , who sent us word that we should send our conditions , which of his part should ( for the better maintenance of amity between the Princes ) be both Fare words favourably granted , and faithfully performed , with many fair words how passing the coast of the Indies he had understood of our honest behaviour towards the inhabitants where we had to do , aswell elsewhere as in the same Port , the which I let pass : thus following our demand , we required victuals for our money , and Our requests . 
 licence to fell as much ware as might furnish our wants , and that there might be of either part twelve gentlemen as hostages for the maintenance of peace : and that the Hand for our better safety might be in our own possession , during our abided there , and such ordinance as was planted in the same Hand which were eleven pieces of brass : and that no Spaniard might land in the Hand with any kind of weapon : these conditions at the first he somewhat misliked , chiefly the guard of the Hand to be in our own keeping , which if they had had , we had soon known our fare : for with the first North wind they had cut our cables and our ships had gone ashore : but in the end he concluded to our request , bringing the twelve hostages to ten , which with all speed of either part were received , with a writing from the Viceroy signed with his hand and sealed with his seal of all the conditions concluded , & forthwith a trumpet blown with commandment that none of either part should be mean to violate the peace upon pain of death : and further it was concluded that the two Generals of the fleets should meet , and give faith each to other for the performance of the premises which was so done . Thus at the end of 3 days all was concluded & the fleet entered the Port , saluting one another as the manner of the sea does require . Thus as I said before , thursday we entered the Port , Friday we saw the fleet , and on munday at night they entered the Port : then we laboured 2. days placing the English ships by themselves & the Spanish ships by themselves , the captains of each part & inferior men of their parts promising great amity of all sides : which even as with all fidelity it was meant on our part , so the Spaniards meant nothing less on their parts , but from the main land had furnished themselves with a supply of men to the number of 1000 , and meant the next thursday being the 23 of September at dinner time to set upon us on all sides . The same Thursday in the morning the treason being at hand , some appearance showed , as shifting of weapon from ship to ship , planting and bending 
 of ordinance from the ships to the Hand where our men warded , passing too and from of companies of men more then required for their necessary business , & many other ill likelihoods , which caused us to have a vehement suspicion , and therewithal ! sent to the Viceroy to inquire Viceroy what was meant by it , which sent immediately straight commandment to plant all things suspicious , and also ■ them ' sent word that he in the faith of a Viceroy would be our defence from all villainies . Yet we being not satisfied with this answer , because we suspected a great number of men to be hid in a great ship of 900 tons , which was mored next unto the Minion , sent again to the Viceroy the master of the Jesus which had the Spanish tongue , and required to be satisfied if any such thing were or not . The Viceroy now seeing that the treason must The treason be discovered , forthwith stayed our master , blew the brake fourth . Trumpet , and of all sides set upon us : our men which warded a shore being stricken with sudden fear , gave place , fled , and sought to recover succour of the ships ; 
 the Spaniardes being before provided for the purpose landed in all places in multitudes from their ships which they might easily do without boats , and slew all our men a shore without mercy , a few of them escaped aboard the Jesus . The great ship which had by the estimation three hundred men placed in her secretly , immediately fell aboard the Minion , but by Gods The Minion appointment , in the time of the suspicion we had , which es / a was only one half hour , the Minion was made ready you to avoid , and so leesing her hedfasts , and hailing away by the sternefastes she was got out : thus with Gods help she defended the violence of the first brunt of these three hundred men . The Minion being passed out , they came aboard the Jesus , which also with very much a doe and the loss of many of our men were defended and kept out . Then there were also two other ships that assaulted The Jesus the Jesus at the same instant , so that she had hard getting lose , but yet with some time we had cut our head-fasts and got out by the stern-fasts . Now when the 
 Jesus and the Minion were got about two ships Sharp wars , length from the Spanish fleet , the fight began so hot on all sides that within one hour the Admiral of the Spaniards was supposed to be sunk , their Viceadmiral 
 3. ships of the burned and one other of their principali ships supposed to consumed sun^e > so that the ships were little able to annoy us . 
 SU ’ Then it is to be understood , that all the Ordinance upon the Island was in the Spaniardes hands , which did us so great annoyance , that it cut all the masts and yards of the Jesus , in such sort that there was no hope A hard case , to carry her away : also it sunk our small ships , whereupon we determined to place the Jesus on that side of the Minion , that she might abide all the battery from the land , and so be a defence for the Minion till night , and then to take such relief of victuali and other necessaries from the Jesus , as the time would suffer us , and to leave her . As we were thus determining , and had placed the Minion from the shot of the land , suddenly the Spaniards had fired two great ships which were coming directly with us , and having no means to avoid the fire , it bred among our men a marvellous fear , so that some said , let us depart with the Minion , other said , let us see whither the wind will carry the fire from us . But to be short , the Minions men which had always their sails in a readiness , thought to make sure work , and so without either consent of the Captain or Master cut their sail , so that very hardly I was received into the Minion . 
 The most part of the men that were left alive in the Jesus , made shift and followed the Minion in a small boat , the rest which the little boat was not able to receive , were enforced to abide the mercy of the Spaniards t0 ( which I doubt was very little ) so with the Minion tyrants^ on^ and JU ( iith ( a small bark of 50 tun ) we A storm , escaped , which bark the same night forsook us in our great misery : we were now removed with the Minion from the Spanish ships two bowshootes , and there road all that night : the next morning we recovered and Hand a mile from the Spaniardes , where there took us a North 
 1568. wind , and being left only with two anchors and two cables ( for in this conflict we lost three cables and two anchors ) we thought always upon death which ever was present , but God preserved us to a longer time . 
 The weather waxed reasonable , and the Saturday we set sail , and having a great number of men and little victuals our hope of life waxed less and less : some ^es desired to yield to the Spaniards , some rather desired to obtain a place where they might give themselves to the Infidels , and some had rather abide with a little pittance Hard choice . the mercy of God at Sea : so thus with many sorrowful hearts we wandered in and unknown Sea by the space of 14 days , till hunger enforced us to seek the land , for hides were thought very good meat , rats , cats , mice and Misery's . dogs , none escaped that might be got , parrats and monkeys that were had in great price , were thought there very profitable if they served the turn one dinner : thus in the end the 8 day of October we came to the land in the bottom of the same bay of Mexico in 23 degrees and a half , where we hoped to have found inhabitants of the Spaniards , relief of victuals , and place for the repair of our ship , which was so soar beaten with shot from our enemies and bruised with shooting ofF our own ordinance , that our weary and weak arms were scarce able to defend and keep out water . But all things happened to the contrary , for we found neither people , victuali , nor haven of relief , but a place where having fair weather with some peril we might land a boat : our people being forced with hunger desired to be set on land , whereunto I consented . 
 And such as were willing to land I put them apart , and such as were desirous to go homewards , I put apart , so that they were indifferently parted a hundred of one side hundred and a hundred of the other side : these hundred men we set a land with all diligence in this little place beforesaid , an^a which being landed , we determined there to take in fresh half . water , and so with our little remain of victuals to take the sea . 
 The next day having a land with me fiftie of our 73 
 hundreth men that remained for the speedier preparing of our water aboard , there arose and extreme storm , so that in three days we could by no means repair aboard our ship : the ship also was in such peril that every hour we looked for shipwreck . 
 But yet God again had mercy on us , and sent fair weather , we had aboard our water , and departed the sixteenth day of October , after which day we had fair and prosperous weather till the sixteenth day of November , which day God be praised we were clear from the coast of the Indies , and out of the channel and gulf of Bahama , which is between the Cape of Florida , and the Islands of Lucayo . After this growing near to the cold country , our men being oppressed with famine , died continually , and they that were left , grew into such weakness that we were scantly able to manage our ship , and the wind being always ill for us to recover England , we determined to go with Galicia in Spaine , with intent there to relieve our company and other extreme wants . And being arrived the last day of December in a place near unto Vigo called Ponte Vedra , our men with excess of fresh meat grew into miserable diseases , and died a great part of them . This matter was born out as long as it might be , but in the end although there were none of our men suffered to go a land , yet by access of the Spaniards , our feebleness was known to them . Whereupon they ceased not to seek by all means to betray us , but with all speed possible we departed to Vigo , where we had some help of certain English ships and twelve fresh men , wherewith we repaired our wants as we might , and departing the 20 day of January 1568 arrived in Mounts bay in Cornewall the 25 of the same month , praised be God therefore . 
 If all the misery's and troublesome affairs of this sorrowful voyage should be perfectly and thoroughly written , there should need a painful man with his pen , and as great a time as he had that wrote the lives and deaths of the Martyrs . John Hawkins .
