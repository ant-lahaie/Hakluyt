And act against the exaction of money or any other thing by any officer for licence to traffic into Iseland & Newfoundland , made in An. 2. Edwardi sexti . 
 Orasmuch as within these few years now last passed , there have be levied , perceived & taken by certain of the officers of the Admiralty , of such Merchants , and fishermen as have used and practised the adventures and journeys into Iseland , New - 
 foundland , Ireland , and other places commodious for fishing , and the getting of fish , in and upon the Seas or otherwise , by way of Merchants in those parties , diverse great exactions , as sums of money , doles or shares of fish , and such other like things , to the great discouragement & hindrance of the same Merchants and fishermen , and to no little damage of the whole common wealth , and thereof also great complaints have be made , & informations also yearly to the kings Majesties most honourable council : for reformation whereof , and to the intent also that the said Merchants and fishermen may have occasion the rather to practise & use the same trade of merchandizing , & fishing freely without any such charges and exactions , as are before limited , whereby it is to be thought that more plenty of fish shall come into this Realm , and thereby to have the same at more reasonable princes : Be it therefore enacted by the king our sovereign Lord , and the lords and commons in this present parliament assembled , and by authority of the same , that neither the Admiral , nor any officer , or minister , officers or ministers of the Admiralty for the time being , shall in any wise hereafter exact , receive , or take by himself , his servant , deputy , servants , or deputies of any such Merchant or fisherman , any sum or sums of money , doles or shares of fish , or any other reward , benefit or advantage whatsoever it be , for any licence to pass this Realm to the said voyages or any of them , nor upon any respect concerning the said voyages , nor any of them , upon pain to forfeit for the first offence triple the sum , or triple the valve of the reward , benefit or advantage , that any such officer or minister shall hereafter have or take of any such Merchants or fishermen . For the which forfeiture the party grieved , and every other person or persons whatsoever he or they be , shall and may sue for the same by information , bill , plaint , or actium of debt in any of the kings courts of record : The king to have the one moiety , and the party complaining the other moiety : in which suit 
 no essoigne , protection , or wager of law shall be allowed . And for the second offence the party so offending not only to loose and forfeit his or their office or offices in the Admiralty , but also to make fine and ransom at the kings will and pleasure . 
 By this act it appears , that the trade out of England to Newfound land was common and frequented about the beginning of the reign of Edward the 6. namely in the year 1548. and it is much to be marveiled , that by the negligence of our men , the country in all this time hath be no better searched .
