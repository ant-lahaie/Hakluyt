a letter of Sir Francis Walsingham to Master Thomas Aidworth merchant , and at that time Mayor of the Ci tie of Bristoll , concerning their adventure in the Western discovery . 
 Fter my hearty commendations , I have for certain causes deferred the answer of your letter of November last till now , which I hope comes all in good time . Your good inclination to the Western discovery I cannot but much commend . And for that sir Humfrey Gilbert , as you 
 have herd long since , hath be preparing into those parts being ready to embark within these 10. days , who needs some further supply of shipping then yet he hath , I am of opinion that you shall do well if the ship or 2. barks you write of , be put in a readiness to go alongst with him , or so soon after as you may . I hope this travel will prove profitable to the Adventurers and generally beneficial to the whole realm : herein I pray you confer with these bearer , M. Richard Hackluyt , and M. Thomas Steventon , to whom I refer you : And so bid you heartily farewell . Richmond the 11. of March . 1582. 
 Your loving Friend , Francis Walsingham .
