Inter eos quasi nuUa placita sunt, & quamvis multum inebrientur, tamen in ebrietate sua nunquam contendunt. Nullus alium spernit, sed juvat & promo vet, quantum congrue potest. Castae sunt eorum mulieres, nee aliquid inter eos auditur de ipsarum impudicitia. Quaedam tamen ex iis verba turpia satis habent & impudica. Porro erga caeteros homines iidem Tartari superbissimi sunt, omnesque nobiles & ignobiles quasi pro nihilo reputantes despiciunt. Unde vidimus in curia Imperatoris magnum Russiae ducem, & filium regis Georgianorum, ac Soldanos multos & magnos nullum honorem debitum recipere apud eos. Quinetiam Tartari eisdem assignati, quantumcunque viles essent illos antecedebant, semperque primum locum & summum tenebant, imo etiam saepe oportebat illos post eorum posteriora sedere. Praeterea iracundi sunt, & indignantis naturae, multum erga caeteros homines, & ultra modum erga In principio quidem blandi sunt, sed eosdem mendaces. postmodum ut Scorpiones pungunt. Subdoli enim & fraudulent sunt, & omnes homines si possunt astutia circumveniunt. Quicquid mali volunt eis facere, miro modo occultant, ut sibi non possint providere, vel contra eorum astutias remedium invenire. Immundi quoque sunt in cibo & potu sumendis, & in caeteris factis suis. Ebrietas apud illos est honorabilis : cumque multum aliquis biberit, ibidemque rejicit, non ideo cessat, quin iterum bibat. Ad petendum maximi sunt exactores, tenacissimi retentores, parcissimi donatores. occisio apud illos est pro nihilo. De legibus & consuetudinibus eorum. Cap. 6. Aliorum hominum AupodoKia. HOc autem habent in lege sive consuetudine, ut Poena occidant viros & mulieres, si quando inveniantur in adulter'tu adulterio manifeste. Similiter etiam virginem, si fornicata fuerit cum aliquo, occidunt earn cum eo. Praeterea si aliquis in praeda vel furto manifesto invenitur, sine ulla Furtu miseratione occiditur. Item si quis denudavit consilia, maxime quando volunt ad bellum procedere, dantur ei super posteriora centum plagse, quanto majores unus Arcani rusticus cum magno baculo potest dare. Similiter cum wulgatu aliqui de minoribus offendunt in aliquo, non eis a majoribus suis parcitur, sed verberibus graviter affliguntur. Matrimonio autem generaliter conjunguntur omnibus, Leges matrietiam propinquis carne, excepta matre & filia & sorore ex moniorufn- eadem matre. Nam sororem tantum ex patre, & uxorem quoque patris, post ejus mortem solent ducere. Uxorem etiam fratris alius frater junior, post ejus mortem, vel alius de parentela, tenetur ducere. Unde dum adhuc Andreas Dux essemus in terra, Dux quidam Russise, Andreas nomine, Russia. apud Baty, quod equos Tartarorum de terra educeret, & ^Ftde Her' f   J alus venderet, accusatus est: quod licet non esset pro- rebus Mos_ batum, occisus est. Hoc audiens junior frater, & uxor chovipag.%.b. occisi, pariter venerunt ad praefatum Ducem, supplicare volentes, ne terra auferretur eisdem. At ille parvo praecepit, ut fratris defuncti duceret uxorem, mulieri quoque ut ilium in virum duceret, secundum Tartarorum consuetudinem. Quas respondit, se potius occidi velle, quam sic contra legem facere. At ille nihilominus earn illi tradidit quamvis ambo renuerent, quantum possent. Itaque ducentes eos in lectum, clamantem puerum & plorantem super illam posuerunt, ipsosque commisceri pariter coegerunt. Denique post mortem maritorum, uxores Tartar- orum non de facili solent ad secunda conjugia transire, nisi 99 bersteintum de 1  J. j. j. forte quis velit sororiam aut novercam suam ducere. Nulla vero differentia est apud eos inter filium uxoris & concubinae, sed dat pater quod vult unicuique. Itaque si sunt etiam ex Ducum genere, ita fit Dux filius concubinae, sicut filius uxoris legitimas. Unde cum rex Georgian duos filios Melkh y David fratres nuipCr^ u n um scilicet nomine Melich legitimum, alterum eorgiam. ^^ David ex adulterio natum haberet, moriensque terras partem adulterae filio reliquisset, Melich, cui etiam ex parte matris regnum obvenerat, quia per foeminas tenebatur, perrexit ad Imperatorem Tartarorum, eo quod & David iter arripuerat ad ilium. Ambobus igitur ad curiam venientibus, datisque maximis muneribus, petebat adulteras filius, ut fieret ei justitia secundum morem Tartarorum. Dataque est sententia contra Melich, ut David, qui major erat natu, subesset, ac terram a patre sibi concessam quiete ac pacifice possideret. Cumque Tartarorum unus habet uxorum multitudinem, unaquasque per se suam habet familiam & stationem. Et una die Tartarus comedit & bibit & dormit cum una, altera die cum alia. Una tamen inter casteras major habetur, cum qua frequentius quam cum aliis commoratur. Et licet, ut dictum est, sint multas, nunquam tamen de facili contendunt inter se. [I. 40.] De superstitiosis traditionibus ipsorum. Cap 7. Uibusdam vero traditionibus indifferentia quaedam esse peccata dicunt, quas vel ipsi vel antecessores eorum confinxerunt. Unum est, cultellum in ignem figere, vel quocunque modo ignem cultello tangere, vel etiam de caldaria cum cultello carnes extrahere, vel cum securi juxta ignem incidere. Credunt enim, quod sic auferri debeat caput igni. Aliud est appodiare se ad flagellum, quo percutitur equus : ipsi enim non utuntur calcaribus. Item flagello sagittas tangere, juvenes aves capere vel occidere, cum fraeno equum percutere, os cum osse alio frangere. Itemque lac, vel aliquem potum aut cibum super terram effundere, in statione mingere. Quod si voluntarie facit, occiditur, si autem aliter, oportet quod fiunt. In principio lunationis vel pecuniam multam incantatori solvat, a quo purificetur. Qui etiam faciat, ut statio cum omnibus, quae in ipsa sunt, inter duos ignes transeat. Antequam sic purificetur, nullus audet intrare, nee aliquid de ilia exportare. Praeterea si alicui morsellus imponitur, quern deglutire non possit, & ilium de ore suo ejicit, foramen sub statione fit, per quod extrahitur, ac sine ulla miseratione occiditur. Iterum si quis calcat super limen stationis Ducis alicujus, interficitur. Multa etiam habent his similia, quae reputant peccata. At homines occidere, aliorum terras invadere, ac res illorum diripere, & contra Dei praecepta vel prohibitiones facere, nullum apud eos est peccatum. De vita aeterna & damnatione perpetua nihil sciunt. Credunt tamen, quod post mortem in alio seculo vivant, gregesque multiplicent, comedant & bibant, & caetera faciant, quae hie a viventibus plenilunio incipiunt, quic quid novi agere volunt, ipsamque Lunam Imperatorem magnum appellant, eamque deprecantes genua flectunt. Omnes, qui morantur in stationibus suis, oportet per ignem purificari. Quas scilicet puri- ficatio fit hoc modo. Duos quidem ignes faciunt, & duas Lustratimis hastas juxta eos, unamque cordam in summitate hastarum illam quasdam de ponunt. Bucaramo scissiones, sub qua scilicet corda & ligaturis inter illos ignes transeunt homines, ac bestiae ac stationes. Sunt etiam duae mulieres, una hinc, & alia inde aquam projicientes, ac quaedam carmina recitantes. Caeterum si aliquis a fulgure occiditur, oportet praedicto modo per ignes transire omnes illos, qui in illis stationibus morantur. Statio siquidem ac lectus & currus, filtra & vestes, & quicquid talium habent, a nullo tanguntur, sed ab hominibus tanquam immunda respuuntur. Et ut breviter dicam, omnia purificari credunt per veniunt ad eos nuncii, vel Principes, aut qualescunque personae, oportet ipsos & munera sua per duos ignes, e-^cacttas' ut purificentur, transire, ne forte veneficia fecerint, aut venenum seu aliquid mali attulerint. ignem.

Homines quoque suas gentis inclinavit ad se, qui tanquam Ducem sequebantur ipsum ad male agendum. Coepit autem pugnare cum Sumongal, sive cum Tartaris, & Ducem eorum interfecit, multoque bello sibi Tartaros omnes subjecit, & in servitutem redegit. Post hasc cum istis omnibus contra Merkatas, juxta terram positos Tartarorum pugnavit, quos etiam bello sibi subjecit. Inde procedens contra Metritas pugnam exercuit, & illos etiam obtinuit.

Unde Chingi praedicto modo jam exaltato, nihilominus in terras prasdictas faciebant insultum, & habitatores occidebant, ac diripiebant praedam eorum. Quod audiens Chingis, omnes sibi subjectos congregavit.

Dumque moram in terra ilia protraherent, Canes in alia fluvii parte convenerunt. Et cum esset hyems asperrima omnes se in aquam projecerunt. Post haec incontinenti sponte in pulverem volvebantur, sicque pulvis admixtus aquae super eos congelabatur, & ut ita pluries fecerunt, glacie super eos depressata, cum impetu magno contra Tartaros ad pugnam convenerunt. At vero cum illi sagittas super eos jaciebant, ac si super lapides sagittassent, retro sagittae redibant. Alia quoque arma eorum in nullo eos laedere poterant. Ipsi vero Canes insultum in Tartaros facientes, morsibus vulneraverunt multos, & occiderunt, sicque illos de suis finibus ejecerunt. Unde adhuc inter illos est proverbium de hoc facto, quod dicunt ad invicem ridendo : Pater meus vel frater meus a illorum, quas Canibus fuit occisus. Mulieres autem ceperant, ad terram suam duxerunt, & usque ad diem mortis eorum ibidem fuerunt. Cum autem exercitus ille Mongalorum rediret, venit ad terram Burithabeth, cujus habitatores pagani sunt, & hos Tartari bello vicerunt. Hi consuetudinem habent mirabilem, imo potius miserabilem. Cum enim alicujus pater humanae naturae solvit debitum, congregant omnem parentelam, & comedunt eum. Hi pilos in barba non habent, imo ferrum quoddam in manibus, sicut vidimus, portant, cum quo semper barbam, si forte crinis aliquis in ea crescit, depilant. Multum etiam deformes sunt.

Cumque ad attentassent, minime potuerunt: quia nubes quaedam erat posita ante ipsos, ultra quam ire nullatenus poterant. Omnino quippe visum amittebant, statim ut ad illam perveniebant. Tartari ad illos accedere formidarent, insultum contra eos Hasem fecerunt, sed statim ut pervenerunt ad nubem propter r^^m^e qua causam praedictam, procedere non potuerunt. Ac vero Haythonus antequam ad montes praedictos pervenirent Tartari, plus- cap. \o. quam per mensem per vastam solitudinem transierunt, & inde procedentes adhuc contra Orientem, plusquam per Itaque mensem per magnum desertum perrexerunt. pervenerunt ad quandam terram, in qua vias quidem tritas videbant, sed neminem invenire poterant. Tandem quaerentes, unum hominem cum uxore sua repererunt, quos in praesentiam Chingischam adduxerunt. Qui cum interrogasset illos, ubi homines illius terrae essent, responderunt, quod in terra sub montibus habitarent. Tune Troglodyte. Chingischam retenta uxore, misit ad eos virum ilium, mandans illis, ut venirent ad ipsius mandatum. Qui pergens ad illos, omnia narravit, quae Chingischam eis mandavit. Illi vero respondentes dixerunt, quod die tali venirent ad ipsum, ut facerent ejus mandatum. Ac ipsi medio tempore per vias occultas sub terra se congregantes, ad pugnam contra illos venerunt, & subito super eos irruentes, plurimos occiderunt. Solis quoque sonitus in Fabulosus ortu suo sustinere non poterant, imo oriebatur, oportebat eos unam aurem ad terram ponere, & 50mtuSt superiorem fortiter obturare, ne sonum ilium terribilem audirent. Nee sic tamen cavere poterant, quin hac de causa plurimi ex eis interirent. Videns ergo Chingischam & sui, quod nihil proficerent, sed potius homines suos 107 perderent, fugerunt, ac terra ilia exierunt. Ilium tamen virum cum uxore sua secum deduxerunt, qui etiam usque ad mortem in terra eorum fuerunt. Interrogati vero, cur in regione sua sub terra soleant habitare, dixerunt, quod ibi quodam tempore anni, aim oritur Sol, tantus fit sonitus, ut homines nulla ratione valeant sustinere. Quin etiam tune in organis & tympanis caeterisque musicis instrumentis percutere solent, ut sonitum ilium non audiant. De statutis Chingischam, et morte ipsius, et filiis ac Ducibus. Cap. 13. tantum Ideoque CUm autem de terra ilia reverteretur Chingischam, defecerunt eis victualia, famemque patiebantur maximam. Tune interiora unius bestiae recentia casu inven- erunt: quae accipientes, depositis stercoribus, decoxerunt, & coram Chingischam deportata pariter statuit Chingischam, ut nee comederunt. sanguis, nee interiora, nee aliquid de bestia, quae manducari potest, projiciatur, exceptis stercoribus. lnde ergo in terram propriam reversus est, ibique leges & statuta edidit, quae Tartari inviolabiliter observant, de quibus scilicet jam alias superius dictum est. Post hoc ab ictu tonitrui occisus est. Habuit autem quatuor filios : Occoday vocabatur primus, Thossut Can secundus, Thiaday tertius, quarti nomen ignoramus. Ab his iiii. descenPrimus filiorum derunt omnes Duces Mongalorum. Occoday est Cuyne, qui nunc est Imperator. Hujus fratres Cocten & Chyrenen. Ex filiis autem Thossut Can sunt Bathy, Ordu, Siba, Bora. Bathy post Imperatorem omnibus ditior est ac potentior. Ordu vero omnium Ducum senior. Filii Thiaday, sunt Hurin & Cadan. Filii autem alterius filii Chingischam, cujus ignoramus nomen, sunt, Mengu & Bithat & alii plures. Hujus Mengu mater Seroctan est, Domina magna inter Tartaros, excepta Imperatoris matre plus nominata, omnibusque potentior, excepto Bathy. Haec autem sunt nomina Ducum: Ordu, qui fuit in Polonia, & Hungaria, Bathy 108 [i. 43.] Chingis lex. Interitus. Libert. Nepotes. quoque & Huryn & Cadan & Syban & Ouygat, qui omnes fuerunt in Hungaria. Sed & Cyrpodan, qui adhuc est ultra mare contra quosdam Soldanos Sarracenorum, & alios habitatores terrae transmarinae. Alii vero remanserunt in terra, scilicet Mengu, Chyrenen, Hubilai, Sinocur, Cara, Gay, Sybedey, Bora, Berca, Corrensa. Alii quoque Duces eorum plures sunt, quorum nomina nobis ignota sunt. De potestate Imperatoris & Ducum ejus. Cap. 14. in om~ POrro Imperator eorum, scilicet Tartarorum, super Imperatoris omnes habet mirabile dominium. Nullus enim audet Tartarorum in aliqua morari parte, nisi ubi assignaverit ipse. Et ipse sew\e quidem assignat Ducibus ubi maneant. Duces autem loca Millenariis assignant, Millenarii vero Centenariis, & Centenarii Decanis. Quicquid autem eis praecipitur, quocunque tempore, quocunque loco, sive ad bellum, sive ad mortem, vel ubicunque, sine ulla obediunt contradictions Nam etsi petit alicujus filiam virginem, vel sororem, mox ei sine contradictione exponunt earn, imo frequenter coUigit virgines ex omnibus Tartarorum finibus, & si vult aliquas retinere, sibi retinet, alias vero dat suis hominibus. Nuncios etiam quoscunque & ubicunque transmittat, oportet quod dent ei sine mora equos & expensas. Similiter undecunque veniant ei tributa vel nuncii, oportet equos & currus & expensas tribui. Ac Inhumanitas vero nuncii, qui aliunde veniunt, in magna miseria, & r &a Le&atosvictus & vestitus penuria sunt. Maximeque quando veniunt ad Principes, & ibi debent moram contrahere. Tune adeo parum datur decem hominibus, quod vix inde possent duo vivere. Insuper & si aliquae illis injurias fiunt, minime conqueri facile possunt. Multa quoque munera tam a principibus quam a casteris ab illis petuntur : quae si non dederint, vilipenduntur, & quasi pro nihilo reputantur. Hinc & nos magnam partem rerum, quae nobis pro expensis a fidelibus erant datae, de necessitate oportuit in muneribus dare. Denique sic omnia sunt in manu Imperatoris, quod nemo audet dicere, Hoc meum est vel illius, sed omnia, scilicet res & jumenta ac homines, sunt ipsius. Super hoc etiam nuper emanavit statutum ejusdem. Idem quoque per omnia dominium habent Duces super sibi subditos homines. De electione Imperatoris Occoday, & legatione Ducis Bathy. Cap. 15. MOrtuo, ut supra dictum est, Cyngischam, convenerunt Duces, & elegerunt Occoday, filium ejus Imperatorem. Qui habito consilio Principum, divisit exercitus. Misitque Bathy, qui in secundo gradu attingebat eum, contra terram Altissodan & contra terram Bisminorum, qui Sarraceni erant, sed loquebantur Comanicum. Qui terram illorum ingressus, cum eis pugnavit, eosque sibi bello subjecit. Quaedam autem civitas, nomine Barchin, diu restitit eis. Cives enim in circuitu civitatis foveas multas fecerant, propter quas non poterant a Tartaris capi, donee illas replevissent. Cives autem urbis Sarguit hoc audientes, exierunt obviam eis, sponte in manus eorum se tradentes. Unde civitas eorum destructa non fuit, sed plures eorum transtulerunt, acceptisque spoliis, occiderunt, & alios urbem aliis hominibus repleverunt, & contra civitatem Orna perrexerunt. Hsec erat nimium populosa & divitiis copiosa. Erant enim ibi plures Christiani, videlicet Gasari & Rutheni, & Alani, & alii nee non & Sarraceni. Eratque Sarracenorum civitatis dominium. Est etiam posita super quendam magnum fluvium, & est quasi portus, habens forum maximum. Cumque Tartari non possent eos aliter vincere, fluvium, qui per urbem currebat, praeciderunt, & illam cum rebus & hominibus submerserunt. Quo facto, contra Russiam perrexerunt, & magnam stragem in ea fecerunt, civitates & castra destruxerunt, & homines occiderunt. Kioviam, Russiae metropolin, diu obsederunt, & tandem ceperunt, ac cives interfecerunt. Unde quando per illam terram ibamus, innumerabilia capita & ossa hominum mortuorum, jacentia super campum, inveniebamus. Fuerat enim urbs valde magna & populosa, nunc quasi ad no Occoday surrogatur patri. Bathy ejusque expeditio. Barchin civitas. Sarguit civitas. Orna civitas. [I. 44O WtdeMechovium, lib. 1.

Quorum consuetudo talis est, ut cum alicujus pater moritur, pras dolore quasi unam corrigiam in signum lamenti ab aure usque aurem de facie sua levet. His autem devictis, Dux Cyrpodan contra Armenios ivit ad meridiem cum suis. Qui cum transirent per deserta quaedam, monstra invenerunt, effigiem humanam habentia, quae non nisi unum brachium cum manu in medio pectoris, & unum pedem habebant, & duo cum uno arcu sagittabant, adeoque fortiter currebant, quod equi eos investigare non poterant. Currebant autem super unum pedem ilium saltando, & cum essent fatigati, taliter eundo ibant super manum & pedem, se tanquam in circulo revolvendo. Cumque sic etiam fesse essent, iterum secundum priorem modum currebant. Hos Isidorus Cyclopedes appellat. Et ex eis Tartari nonnullos occiderunt. Et sicut nobis a Ruthenis Clericis in curia dicebatur, qui morantur cum Imperatore praedicto, plures ex eis nuncii venerunt in legatione ad curiam Imperatoris, superius annotati, ut possent habere pacem cum illo. Inde procedentes venerunt in Armeniam, quam bello devicerunt, & etiam Georgiae partem. Alia vero pars venit ad mandatum eorum, & singulis annis dederunt, & adhuc dant ei pro tributo xx. millia Yperperarum. Hinc ad terram Soldani Deurum, potentis & magni, processerunt, cum quo etiam pugnantes, ipsum devicerunt. Denique processerunt ulterius debellando ac vincendo usque ad terram Soldani Halapiae, & nunc etiam terram obtinent, alias quoque terras ultra illas proponentes impugnare: nee postea reversi sunt in terram suam usque hodie. Idemque exercitus contra terram Caliphi Baldach perrexit, quam etiam sibi subdidit, & ut CCCC. Byzantios, exceptis Baldekinis caeterisque muneribus, ei quotidie pro tributo daret, obtinuit. Sed & quolibet anno mittunt nuncios ad Caliphum, ut ad eos veniat. Qui cum tributo munera magna trasmittens, ut eum supportent, rogat.

Decem quoque millenariis praeponunt unum, cunctoque nihilominus exercitui duos aut tres Duces, ita tamen ut ad unum habeant respectum. Cumque in bello contra aliquos congrediuntur, nisi communiter cedant, omnes qui fugiunt, occiduntur. Et si [I. 45.] unus aut duo, vel plures ex decem audacter accedunt ad pugnam, alii vero ex illo Denario non sequuntur, similiter occiduntur. Sed etiam si unus ex decem vel plures capiuntur, socii eorum si non eos liberant, ipsi etiam occidun- tur. Porro arma debent habere talia. Duos arcus vel Armatura. unum bonum ad minus. Tresque pharetras sagittis plenas, & unam securim & funes ad machinas trahendas. Divites autem habent gladios in fine acutos, ex una parte tantum incidentes, & aliquantulum curvos. Habent & equos armatos, crura etiam tecta, galeas & loricas. Verum loricas & equorum cooperturas quidam habent de corio, super corpus artificiose duplicato vel etiam triplicato. Galea vero superius est de chalybe, vel de ferro: sed illud, quod in circuitu protegit collum & gulam, est de corio. Quidam autem de ferro habent omnia supradicta, in hunc modum formata. Laminas multas tenues ad unius digiti latitudinem & palmae longitudinem faciunt, & in qualibet octo foramina parvula facientes, interius tres corrigias strictas & fortes ponunt. Sicque laminas, unam alii quasi per gradus ascendendo, supponunt. Itaque laminas ad corrigias, tenuibus corrigiolis per foramina praedicta immissis, ligant, & in superiori parte corrigiolam unam ex utraque parte duplicatam cum alia corrigiola consuunt, ut laminae simul bene firmiterque cohaereant. Haec faciunt tarn ad cooperturas equorum, quam ad armaturas hominum. Adeoque faciunt ilia lucere, quod in eis potest homo faciem suam videre. Aliqui vero in collo ferri lanceae uncum habent, cum quo de sella, si possunt, hominem detrahant. Sagittarum eorum ferramenta sunt acutissima, ex utraque parte quasi gladius biceps incidentia, semperque juxta pharetram portant limas ad acuendum sagittas. Habent vero scuta de viminibus, aut de virgulis facta. Sed non credimus, quod ea soleant portare, nisi ad castra & ad custodiam Imperatoris ac principum, & hoc tantum de nocte. In bellis astutissimi sunt: UsusbeUorum. quia per annos xlii. cum caeteris gentibus dimicarunt. Cum autem ad flumina pervenerunt, majores habent Mos tranandi rotundum ac leve corium, in cujus summitate per circui- 113 fli 1 turn ansas crebras facientes, funem imponunt ac stringunt, ita quod in circuitu quasi ventrem efficiunt, quern vestibus ac rebus caeteris replent, fortissimeque ad invicem comprimunt. In medio autem ponunt sellas & alias res duriores: ibi quoque sedent homines. Hujusmodi navim ad equi caudam ligant, & hominem, qui equum regat, pariter natare faciunt, vel habent aliquando duos remos, cum quibus remigant. Equo igitur in aquam impulso, omnes alii equi sequuntur ilium, & sic transeunt fluvium. Pauperior autem quilibet unam bursam vel saccum de corio bene consutum habet, in quo res suas omnes imponit, & in summitate fortiter ligatum, ad equi caudam suspendit, sicque modo praedicto transit. Qualiter resistendum sit eis. Cap. 18. N1 rUllam aestimo provinciam esse, quae per se possit eis resistere : quia de omni terra potestatis suae solent homines ad bellum congregare. Et siquidem vicina provincia non vult eis opem ferre, quam impugnant, delentes illam, cum hominibus, quos ex ilia capiunt, contra aliam pugnant. Et illos quidem in acie primos ponunt, & si Ti^ r . . {-,, m a ^ e P ^ g n a n t ) Itaque si Chnstiani eis resistere volunt, oportet quod Principes ac rectores terrarum in unum conveniant, ac de communi consilio eis resistant.

Ferramentum. menta vero sagittarum more Tartarorum, quando sunt calida, temperare debent in aqua, cum sale mixta, ut fortia sint ad penetrandum illorum arma. Gladios etiam & lanceas cum uncis habeant, qui volunt, ad detrahendum illos de sella, de qua facillimfe cadunt. Habeant & galeas & arma caetera, ad protegendum corpus & equum ab armis & sagittis eorum, & si qui non ita sunt armati, debent more illorum post alios ire, & contra ipsos arcubus vel balistis trajicere. Et sicut dictum est supra de Tartaris, debent acies suas ordinare, ac legem pugnantibus imponere. Quicunque conversus fuerit ad praedam ante victoriam, maximam debet poenam subire : talis enim apud illos occiditur absque miseratione. Locus ad praelium, si fieri potest, eligendus est planus, ut undique possint videre, nee omnes debent in unum convenire, sed acies multas & divisas, nee tamen nimis distantes ab invicem, facere. Contra illos, qui primi veniunt, debent unam aciem mittere, & alia parata sit ad juvandum illam opportuno tempore. Habeant & speculators ex omni parte, qui videant, quando veniunt acies caeterae. Nam ide6 semper debent aciem contra aciem, ut ei occurrant, mittere, quoniam illi semper nituntur adversarios in medio concludere. Hoc autem acies caveant, ne si etiam illi fugere videantur, diu post illos currant, ne forte, sicut facere solent, ipsos ad paratas insidias trahant : quia plus fraudulentia quam fortitudine pugnant. Et iterum ne fatigentur equi eorum : quia nostri multitudinem non habent equorum. Tartari ver6 quos equitant die una, non ascendunt tribus diebus, vel quatuor postea. Praeterea si cedunt Tartari, non ideo debent nostri recedere, vel ab invicem separari : quoniam hoc simulando faciunt, ut exercitus [I. 46.] dividatur, & sic ad terrae destructionem liberfe ingrediantur. Caeterhm Duces nostri die noctiique facere debent exercitum custodiri : nee jacere spoliati, sed semper ad pugnam parati : quia Tartari quasi Daemones semper vigilant, excogitantes artem nocendi. Porro si aliqui Tartarorum in bello de suis equis projiciuntur, statim capiendi sunt, quia quando sunt in terra fortiter sagittant, & equos hominesque vulnerant. De itinere Fratris Johannis de Piano carpini usque ad primam custodiam Tartarorum. Cap. 19. NOs igitur ex mandato sedis Apostolicae cum iremus ad Orientis nationes, elegimus prius ad Tartaros proficisci : quia timebamus, ne per illos in proximo Ecclesiae Dei periculum immineret.

Audito autem, quod oporteret nos illis munera dare, quasdam pelles castorum & aliorum animalium fecimus emi, de hoc, quod datum nobis fuerat in eleemosynam ad subsidium * Grimiskua, viae. Quod agnoscentes Dux Conradus & * Ducissa utMechovius Cracoviae, & Episcopus & quidam milites, plures etiam / . 1. cap. 9. n o k j s dederunt hujusmodi pelles. Denique Dux Wasilico a Duce Cracoviae, & Episcopo atque Baronibus pro nobis attente rogatus, secum nos in terram suam duxit, & ut aliquantulum quiesceremus, aliquot diebus nos in expensis suis detinuit. Et cum rogatus a nobis, fecisset Episcopos suos venire, legimus eis literas Domini Papae, monentis eos, ad sanctae matris JbLcclesiae unitatem redire. Ad idem quoque nos ipsi monuimus eos, & induximus, quantum potuimus, tarn Ducem quam Episcopos & alios. Sed quia Lt*e Fa^ ad Russos. A 1  j 1  & .. , .

Post hasc Dux Wasilico transmisit nos usque in Kioviam metropolin Russiae, cum serviente uno. Ibamus tamen in periculo capitis semper propter Lituanos, qui saepe faciebant insultum super terram Russiae, & in illis maxime locis, per quos debebamus transire. At per praedictum servientem eramus securi a Ruthenis, quorum etiam maxima pars occisa vel captivata erat a Tartaris. tune infirmati in vehiculo per nivem & frigus magnum trahi nos fecimus. Cum ergo Kioviam pervenimus, habuimus de via nostra consilium cum millenario ac caeteris ibidem nobilibus. Qui responderunt nobis, quod si duceremus equos illos, quos tune 116 in Danilone usque ad mortem fuimus. Nihilominus tamen Porr6 habebamus, ad Tartaros, chm essent magnae nives, morerentur omnes : quia nescirent herbam fodere sub nive, Pabulum equo- sicut equi faciunt Tartarorum, nee inveniri posset aliquod rum crartancpro eis ad manducandum, cum Tartari nee stramina nee foenum habeant, nee pabulum. Itaque decrevimus eos illic dimittere cum duobus pueris, deputatis eorum custodiae. Ideoque nos oportuit millenario dare munera, ut ipsum haberemus propitium, ad dandum nobis equos subductitios & conductum. Secundo igitur die post festum Purificationis cepto itinere, venimus ad villam Canovae, quae sub Tartaris erat immediate. Cujus praefectus nobis dedit equos & conductum usque ad aliam, in qua reperimus prasfectum Micheam, omni malitia plenum. Qui tamen Micheas acceptis a nobis muneribus secundum velle suum, duxit irdyKaK0Snos usque ad primam custodiam Tartarorum. Qualiter primo cum sociis suis receptus est a Tartaris. Cap. 20. CUm ergo in prima sexta feria post diem cinerum, Sole ad occasum tendente, hospitaremur. Tartari super nos armati horribiliter irruerunt, quasrentes cujusmodi homines essemus : cumque respondissemus, quod Domini Papas nuncii essemus, quibusdam cibariis a nobis acceptis, continuo discesserunt. Porro mane facto, cum surgentes aliquantulum processissemus, majores illorum, qui erant in custodia, nobis occurrerunt, interrogantes, cur ad eos veniremus ? & quid negotii haberemus ? Quibus respondimus, Domini Papae nuncii sumus, qui Christianorum pater FaPa Ckristi- est ac Dominus. Hie nos idcirco tarn ad Regem quam ad P«*r .rrincipes, omnesque lartaros, mittit, quia placet ei, quod omnes Christiani Tartarorum sint amici, & pacem habeant cum ipsis. Desiderat insuper, ut apud Deum in coelo sint Legationis magni, & idcirco monet eos tarn per nos quam per literas ni^ndataJ suas, ut efficiantur Christiani, fidemque recipiant Domini nostri Jesu Christi, quia non possunt aliter salvari. Mandat praeterea, quod miratur de tanta occisione hominum, & maxime Christianorum, ac potissime Hungarorum, Montanorum, & Polonorum, qui sunt ei subjecti, facta per 117 Corrensa.

Super his etiam rogat, ut ei rescribant, quid facere velint de caetero, & quae sit eorum intentio. Quibus auditis, & intellectis, dixerunt Tartari, se velle equos nobis subductitios usque ad Corrensam & ducatum praebere. Statimque munera petierunt, & a nobis acceperunt. Equis igitur acceptis, de quibus descenderant ipsi, cum eorum ducatu ad Corrensam arripuimus iter eundi. Ipsi tamen velociter equitantes, nuncium unum praemiserunt ad praefatum Ducem cum his verbis, quae dixeramus eisdem. Est autem Dux iste Dominus omnium, qui positi sunt in custodia contra omnes Occidentis populos, ne forte subit6 & improviso irruant aliqui super illos. Et iste dicitur habere sexaginta millia hominum armatorum sub se. Qualiter recepti sunt apud Corrensam. Cap. 21. CUm ergo pervenissemus ad ejus curiam, fecit nobis longe a se poni stationem, & misit ad nos procuratores suos, ut quaererent a nobis, cum quo ei vellemus inclinare, id est, quae ei munera inclinando vellemus offerre. Quibus respondimus, quod Dominus Papa non mittebat aliqua munera ; quia non erat certus, quod ad illos pervenire possemus, & insuper veneramus per loca valde periculosa. Veruntamen in quantum de his, quae habebamus ex gratia Dei & Domini Papae ad victum nostrum, sicut poterimus, honorabimus ipsum. Acceptisque muneribus duxerunt nos ad ordam sive tentorium ipsius, & instructi fuimus, ut ante ostium stationis ter cum sinistro genu inclinaremus, & caveremus attente, ne pedem super limen ostii poneremus.

Cum igitur ad Ordam pervenissemus, interrogati a procuratore ipsius Eldegay, cum quo inclinare vellemus ? idem quod prius apud Corrensam respondimus, datisque muneribus & acceptis, auditis etiam itineris causis, introduxerunt nos in stationem Principis, prius facta inclinatione, & audita de limine non calcando, sicut Ingressi autem flexis genibus, verba nostra proposuimus, deinde literas obtulimus, & ut nobis darentur interpretes ad transferendum eas, rogavimus. Qui etiam in die Parasceve dati fuerunt nobis, & eas in litera Ruthenica, Sarracenica & in Tartarica diligenter cum interpretatio Bathy ipsis praesentata legit, & attente notavit. Tandem ad nostram stationem reducti fuimus, sed nulla cibaria nobis dederunt, nisi semel aliquantulum millii in una scutella, scilicet in prima nocte quando venimus. transtulimus.

Tentoria quoque de panno lineo habet pulchra & magna satis, quae fuerunt Hungarian regis. Nee aliquis ad ejus tentorium audet accedere praeter familiam, nisi vocatus, quantumcunque sit potens & magnus, nisi forte sciatur, quod sit voluntas ipsius.

Sed cum rediissent usque ad Montii Ducem supradictum, ibi retenti fuerunt usque ad reditum nostrum. Nos autem in die Paschae officio dicto, & facta comestione qualicunque cum duobus Tartaris, qui nobis apud Corrensam fuerant assignati, cum multis lacrymis recessimus, nescientes utrum ad mortem vel vitam pergeremus. Eramus tamen ita infirmi corpore, quod vix poteramus equitare. In tota siquidem ilia quadragesima fuerat cibus noster millium cum aqua & sale tantum, & in aliis similiter diebus jejuniorum.

Post haec intravimus terram Kangittarum, quae magnam habet in plurimis locis penuriam aquarum, in qua etiam homines pauci morantur propter aquae defectum. Unde homines Jeroslai, Ducis Russiae, cum ad ipsum in terram Tartarorum perrexerunt, plures eorum in illo deserto prae siti mortui sunt.

Sic tandem ad primam Imperatoris curiam venimus, in qua Prima curia erat una de uxoribus ipsius. In terra vero ilia Imperatoris. Qualiter ad ipsum Cuyne, Imperatorem futurum pervenerunt. Cap. 25.

Idcirco de mane surgentes, ibamus usque ad noctem sine comestione, & saepius tarn tarde veniebamus, quod non comedebamus in sero, sed quod manducare debebamus in vespere, dabatur nobis in mane.

Interpretatio tamen literarum Domini Papae, ac verba etiam a nobis dicta, a prasdicto Baty erant ei mandata. Cum ergo stetissemus ibi per quinque vel sex dies, ad matrem suam nos transmisit, ubi adunabatur curia solennis. Et cum Tentorium venissemus illuc, tarn extensum erat tentorium magnum, je alba purpura prasparatum, eratque tarn grande nostro return. judicio, quod plusquam duo millia hominum poterant esse sub illo. Et in circuitu factum erat ligneum tabulatum Illuc ergo perreximus cum variis imaginibus depictum.

Et tune venit Cuyne ad tentorium illud. Porro tertia die fuerunt omnes in blaueis purpuris, & quarta in optimis Baldakinis. In illo autem tabulato juxta tentorium erant duae majores portae, per quarum unam solus Imperator debebat intrare, & ad illam nulla erat custodia, quamvis esset aperta, quia per illam nullus audebat ingredi vel exire: per aliam omnes, qui admittebantur, intrabant, & ad illam custodes cum gladiis & arcubus & sagittis erant. Itaque si quis tentorio propinquabat ultra terminos, qui positi erant, si capiebatur, verberabatur, si fugiebat, sagitta sive ferro sagittabatur. Multique ibi erant, qui in fraenis, pectoralibus, sellis & hujusmodi, judicio nostro, auri circiter viginti marcas habebant. Sic Duces infra tentorium colloquebantur, & de Imperatoris electione tractabant, ut a nobis creditur. Alius autem universus populus longe extra tabulatum collocabatur, & ita fere usque ad meridiem morabantur. Tune incipiebant lac jumentinum bibere, & usque ad vesperas tantum bibebant, quod erat visu mirabile. Nos autem vocaverunt interius, Symposium & dederunt nobis cerevisiam: quia jumentinum lac non Procerum* bibebamus. Et hoc quidem nobis pro magno fecerunt honore: sed tamen nos compellebant ad bibendum, quod nullatenus poteramus propter consuetudinem sustinere. Unde ostendimus eis, hoc esse nobis grave, ideoque nos cessaverunt compellere. Foris autem erat Dux Jeroslaus Jeroslaus Dux de Susdal Russiae, pluresque Duces Kythaorum & Solan- ^usstagorum. Duo quoque nlii regis Georgiae, nuncius etiam Caliphi de Baldach, qui erat Soldanus, & plus quam decem nationum. alii Soldani Sarracenorum, ut credimus. Et sicut nobis a procuratoribus dicebatur, erant ibi nunciorum plus quam quatuor millia, inter illos, qui tributa portabant, & illos, qui deferebant munera, & Soldanos ac Duces alios, qui ad tradendum seipsos veniebant, & illos, pro quibus ipsi miserant, illosque, qui terrarum praefecti erant. Hi omnes 125 Imperil Cuynw primitive. Syra orda. Aurea orda. Augusti 15. Preces solennes. simul extra tabulatum ponebantur, eisque simul bibere praebebatur. Nobis autem & Duci Jerozlao fere semper ab eis dabatur superior locus, quando cum eis eramus exterius. Qualiter in imperium sublimatus fuit. Cap. 27. ET quidem, si bene meminimus, ibidem per septimanas circiter quatuor fuimus. Credimusque, quod ibi fiiit electio celebrata, non tamen ibidem fuit publicata. Propid maxime credebatur, quia semper, ter hoc autem quando Cuyne tentorio exibat, eidem cantabatur, & cum virgis speciosis, in summitate lanam coccineam habentibus, inclinabatur, quod alteri Ducum nulli fiebat, quousque exterius morabatur. Haec autem statio sive Curia nominatur ab eis Syra orda. Hinc exeuntes, unanimiter omnes equitavimus per tres aut quatuor leucas ad alium locum, ubi erat in quadam pulchra planicie juxta rivum inter montes aliud tentorium, quod apud ipsos appellatur Orda Ibi enim Cuyne debebat poni in sede aurea, praeparatum. in die Assumptionis Dominae nostrae. Sed propter grandinem nimiam, quae tune, ut supra dictum est, cecidit, res dilata fuit. Eratque tentorium in columnis positum, quae laminis aureis erant tectae, & clavis aureis cum aliis lignis fixae. Porro de Baldakino erat tectum superius, sed alii erant panni exterius. Fuimus autem ibi usque ad festum Beati Bartholomaei, in quo maxima multitudo convenit, & contra meridiem versis vultibus stetit. Et quidam ad jactum lapidis longe a caeteris erant, semperque orationes faciendo, ac genua flectendo, contra meridiem longius, & longius procedebant. Nos autem utrum incantationes facerent, aut genua Deo vel alteri flecterent, nescientes, nolebamus facere genu flexiones. Cumque diu ita fecissent, ad tentorium reversi sunt, & Cuyne in imperiali posuerunt, Ducesque coram eo genua sede fecit universus populus, flexerunt. Post hoc idem exceptis nobis, qui eis subditi non eramus. De astate ac moribus ac sigillo ipsius. Cap. 28.

Medio- ^ mreSm chnsttammicris erat staturae, prudens valde, nimis astutus multumque seriosus, & gravis in moribus. Nee unquam videbat eum homo de facili ridere, vel aliquam levitatem facere, sicut dicebant Christiani, qui cum ipso morabantur continue. Dicebant etiam nobis asserendo firmiter Christiani, qui erant de familia ejus, quod deberet fieri Christianus. Cujus signum erat, quod ipse Clericos Christianos tenebat, Siu^ium & expensas eis dabat. Habebat etiam semper capellam Christianorum ante majus tentorium suum, ubi cantant Clerici publice & aperte, ac pulsant ad horas, ut caeteri Christiani secundum mores Graecorum, quantacunque sit ibi multitudo Tartarorum, vel etiam aliorum hominum. Hoc tamen non faciunt alii Duces ipsorum. Est autem Majestas. mos Imperatoris ipsius, ut nunquam ore proprio loquatur cum extraneo, quantumcunque magnus sit, sed audit & [I. 51.] respondet per interpositam personam, & quandocunque negotium proponunt, vel Imperatoris responsionem audiunt illi, qui sub eo sunt, quantumcunque sint magni, flexis genibus usque ad finem verborum persistunt. Nee alicui de consuetudine super aliquo negotio loqui licitum est, postquam ab Imperatore definitum est. Habet autem Imperator praedictus procuratorem & protonotarios, atque scriptores, omnesque officiales in negotiis tarn publicis quam privatis, exceptis Advocatis. Nam sine litium vel Potestas judiciorum strepitu secundum arbitrium Imperatoris omnia ex^x "** fiunt. Alii quoque Principes Tartarorum de his, quae ad illos pertinent, idem faciunt. Hoc autem noverint universi, quia nobis tune existentibus in solenni curia, jam ex pluribus annis indicta, idem Cuyne Imperator, de novo electus, cum omnibus suis Principibus erexit vexillum Bellum in contra Ecclesiam Dei, ac Romanum Imperium, & contra ^hri5ttanos omnia regna Christianorum & populos Occidentis, nisi co®a u fortasse, quod absit, facerent ea, quae mandabat Domino Papae, atque potentibus, & omnibus Christianorum populis, videlicet ut ipsi subdantur eis. Nam excepta Christi- anitate, nulla est terra in orbe, quam timeant, & idcirco contra nos ad pugnam se praeparant. Hujus siquidem Imperatoris pater, scilicet Occoday, necatus fuerat veneno, & ob hoc a bellis quieverant tempore pauco. Intentio autem eorum, ut dictum est supra, est, sibi to turn subjicere mundum, sicut a Chingischam habent mandatum. Unde & ipse Imperator in literis suis ita scribit: Dei fbrtitudo, omnium hominum Imperator.

Cumque Chingay protonotarius ejus nomina nostra scripsisset, illorumque a quibus missi eramus, & Ducis Solangorum & aliorum, clamavit alta voce, recitans ilia coram Imperatore ac Ducum universitate. Quo facto, flexit unusquisque nostrum quater genu sinistrum, & monuerunt, ne tangeremus limen deorsum. Cumque pro cultellis nos diligentissime scrutati fuissent, & nullatenus invenissent, intravimus ostium ab Orientali parte: quia nullus ab Occidente, nisi solus imperator, audet intrare. Similiter & Dux ab ilia parte ingreditur solus, si est tentorium ejus. Minores autem non multum curant de talibus. Tune ergo primum in ejus praesentia suam intravimus stationem, videlicet postquam factus est Impera- tor ibidem. Omnes quoque nuncii tune ab eo recepti sunt, sed paucissimi tentorium ejus intraverunt. Ibi vero tanta Munera donaria ab ipsis nunciis fuerunt ei praesentata, quid quasi etdm ohlata' videbantur infinita, videlicet in samitis ac purpureis & baldakinis ac cingulis sericis cum auro praeparatis, pellibus etiam nobilibus, caeterisque muneribus. Quoddam etiam Solinum, sive tentoriolum, quod super caput Imperatoris portatur, fuit eidem praesentatum, quod totum erat cum gemmis praeparatum. Quidam vero praefectus unius provinciae adduxit ei Camelos multos cum Baldakinis tectos. Similiter sellae positas cum instrumentis quibusdam erant, in quibus homines interius sedere valebant. Equos etiam multos & mulos adducebant eidem phaleratos & armatos, quosdam quidem de corio, & quosdam de ferro. Nos etiam requisiti fuimus, an ei munera dare vellemus: sed jam facultas non erat, quoniam omnia fere nostra consumpseramus. positi currus plusquam quingenti, qui omnes auro & er7(ra^ ^opOL' argento ac sericis vestibus erant pleni. Cunctique inter imperatorem & Duces divisi fuerunt, singulique Duces inter homines suos partes suas, ut eis placuit, diviserunt. Ibidem longe a stationibus super montem erant Currus De loco divisionis Imperatoris & matris suae, & morte Jeroslai, Ducis Russiae. INde recedentes, venimus ad alium locum, ubi tentorium Tentorium mirabile, totum de purpura rufa, quod Kitay dederant, P^'Pureumerat positum. Illic interius introducti fuimus, & semper cum intrabamus nobis dabatur ad bibendum cerevisia vel vinum, & etiam carnes coctae, si volebamus, ad edendum.

Qualiter tandem Fratres ad Imperatorem accedentes, literas dederunt & acceperunt. Cap. 3 1DEnique Tartari nostri nos ad Imperatorem duxerunt: qui cum audisset per illos, nos ad eum venisse, jussit nos ad matrem redire. Volebat enim secundo die, sicut superius dictum est, contra totam Occidentis terram vexillum erigere, quod nos volebat ignorare. Itaque reversi stetimus paucis diebus, & iterum ad ipsum reversi sumus. Cum quo bene per mensem fuimus in tanta fame ac siti, quod vix vivere poteramus. Nam expensae, quae nobis pro diebus quatuor dabantur, vix uni sufficiebant. Nee invenire poteramus aliquid ad emendum, quia forum erat nimis remotum. Sed Dominus nobis quendam Ruthenum, nomine Cosmam, aurifabrum praeparavit, qui satis dilectus Imperatori, nos in aliquo sustentavit. Et hie nobis ostendit thronum Imperatoris, quern ipse fecerat, antequam poneretur in sede, & sigillum ejusdem, quod etiam fabricaverat ipse. Post hoc Imperator pro nobis misit, nobisque per Chingay protonotarium suum dici fecit, ut verba nostra 130 Cuyne cum legatis dissimulanter agit. Cosmas Russus. Chingay & negotia scriberemus, eique porrigeremus. Quod & fecimus. Post plures dies nos iterum vocari fecit, & utrum essent apud Dominum Papam, qui Ruthenorum vel Sarracenorum, aut etiam Tartarorum literam intelligerent, interrogavit. Cui respondimus, quod nullam istarum literarum habebamus. Sarraceni tamen erant in terra, sed remoti erant a Domino Papa. Diximus tamen, quia nobis Prudens de expedire videbatur, quod in Tartarico scriberent, & nobis ?*ns con~ interpretarentur, nos autem in litera nostra diligenter scriberemus, & tarn literam quam interpretationem ad Domi- num Papam deferremus. Tune a nobis recesserunt, & ad Imperatorem iverunt. Porro a die Beati Martini fuimus vocati. Tune Kadac, totius imperii procurator, & Chingay & Bala, pluresque scriptores ad nos venerunt, nobisque literam de verbo ad verbum interpretati fuerunt. Et cum in Latina litera scripsissemus, faciebant sibi per singulas orationes interpretari, volentes scire, si nos in aliquo verbo erraremus. Cum igitur ambae literae fuissent scriptae, fecerunt nos semel ac secundo legere, ne forte minus aliquid haberemus. Dixerunt enim nobis, videte, quod omnia bene intelligatis, quia non expediret, quod non omnia bene intelligeretis. Literas etiam in Sarracenico scripserunt, ut aliquis in partibus nostris inveniri posset, qui eas, si opus esset, legeret. Qualiter licentiati fuerunt. Cap. 32. UT autem nobis Tartari nostri dixerunt, proposuit Imperator nuncios suos nobiscum mittere. Volebat tamen, ut credimus, quod nos id ab eo peteremus. Sed cum unus de Tartaris nostris, qui senior erat, nos ad hoc petendum hortaretur, nobis quidem, ut venirent, ne quaquam bonum videbatur. non erat nostrum petere, sed si sponte ipse Imperator mit- a Ideoque respondimus ei, quod Legati v , r J r j v r - r \- rrhorrent a J -* artarorum teret eos, libenter eos secure conduceremus, Domino ad- ad Ckristianos juvante.

Itaque tertia die post hoc, scilicet in festo beati Briccii fuit, timebamus eos exploratores terrae fieri. Tertia vero, quia timebamus eos interfici. Gentes enim nostrae arrogantes sunt & superbae. Unde quando servientes, qui stant nobiscum, ex rogatu Cardinalis, legati scilicet Alemanniae, in habitu Tartarico ibant ad ipsum, in via fer£ lapidati sunt a Teutonicis, & coacti sunt deponere habitum ilium. Consuetudo autem est Tartarorum, ut cum illis, qui nuncios eorum occiderint, nunquam faciant pacem, nisi sumant de ipsis ultionem. Quarta etiam causa fuit, quia timebamus ne nobis auferrentur vi. Quinta vero causa erat, quia de adventu eorum nulla foret utilitas, cum nullum haberent aliud mandatum vel potestatem, nisi quod literas Imperatoris ad Dominum Papam & ad Principes deferrent, quas videlicet literas ipsi nos habebamus, & malum ex eorum adventu posse contingere credebamus. nobis dederunt licentiam & literam, Imperatoris sigillo munitam, mittentes nos ad ipsius Imperatoris matrem, quae unicuique nostrum dedit pelliceum unum de pellibus vulpinis, quod habebat pilos de foris, & purpuram unam. De quibus Tartari nostri furati sunt ex unaquaque unum passum. De ilia quoque, quae dabatur servienti, meliorem medietatem sunt furati. Quod nos quidem non ignoravimus, sed inde verba movere noluimus. Qualiter ab illo itinere redierunt. Cap. 33. TUnc iter ad revertendum arripuimus, ac per totam hyemem venimus, jacentes in desertis saspiiis in nive, nisi quantum poteramus nobis cum pede locum facere. Ibi quippe non erant arbores, sed planus campus. Et saepe mane nos inveniebamus totos nive, quam ventus pellebat, coopertos. Sic venientes usque ad Ascensionem Domini pervenimus ad Bathy. A quo cim inquireremus, quid responderet Domino Papas, dixit se nolle aliud, nisi quod Imperator diligenter scripserat, demandare. Datisque nobis de conductu literis, ab eo recessimus, & sabbatho infra octavas Pentecostes usque ad Montii pervenimus, ubi erant socii nostri, ac servientes, qui fuerant retenti, 132 i. 530 Honorantur commeatu lautiis.

Of the first sending of certaine Friers Predicants and Minorites unto the Tartars, taken out of the 32. Booke of Vincentius Beluacensis his Speculum Historiale: beginning at the second Chapter. i ,, . _ jBout this time also, Pope Innocentius the fourth sent Frier Ascelline being one of the order of the Praedicants, together with three other Friers (of the same authoritie whereunto they were called) consorted with him out of divers Covens of their order, with letters Apostolicall unto the Tartars campe : wherein hee exhorted them to give over their bloudie slaughter of mankinde, and to receive the Christian faith. And I, in verie deede, received the relations concerning the deedes of the Tartars onelie, (which, according to the congruence of times, I have above inserted into this my woorke) from a Frier Minorite, called Simon de Sanct. Quintin, who lately returned from the same voyage. And at that verie time also, there was a certaine other Frier Minorite, namely Frier John de Piano Carpini, sent with certaine associates unto the Tartars, who likewise (as himselfe witnesseth) abode and conversed with them a yeere and three moneths at the least. For both he & one Frier Benedict a Polonian being of the same order, and a partaker of all his miserie and tribulation, received straight commaundement from the Pope, that both of them shoulde diligently searche out all things that concerned the state of the Tartars. And therefore this Frier John hath written a litle Historie (which is come to our hands) of such things, as with his owne eyes hee sawe among the Tartars, or which he heard from divers Christians worthy of credit, remaining there in captivitie. Out of which historie I Ascellinus. Simon Quintinianus. John de piano Carpini. Benedictus Polonus. thought good by way of conclusion, to insert somewhat for the supply of those things which are wanting in the said Frier Simon. Of the situation and qualitie of the Tartars land, By Johannes de Piano Carpini. Chap. 3. THere is towards the East a land which is called Mon- A description gal or Tartaria, lying in that part of the worlde which of Tartaria. In some part thereof it is ®ceanis thought to be most North Easterly. On the East part it hath the countrey of Kythay and of the people called Solangi : on the South part the countrey of the Saracens : on the South east the land of the Huini : and on the West the province of Naimani : but on the North side it is The North invironed with the Ocean Sea. full of mountaines, and in other places plaine and smoothe grounde, but everie where sandie and barren, neither is the hundreth part thereof fruitefull. For it cannot beare fruite unlesse it be moistened with river waters, which bee verie rare in that countrey. Whereupon they have neither villages, nor cities among them, except one which is called Cracurim, and is said to be a proper towne. We our selves sawe not this towne, but were almost within halfe a dayes journey thereof, when we remained at Syra Orda, Syra Orda. which is the great court of their Emperour. And albeit the foresaid lande is otherwise unfruitfull, yet is it very commodious for the bringing up of cattell. In certaine places thereof are some small store of trees growing, but otherwise it is altogether destitute of woods. Therefore the Emperour, and his noble men and all other warme themselves, and dresse their meate with fires made of the doung of oxen, and horses. The ayre also in that The countrey is verie intemperate. For Sommer there be great thunders and lightnings, by the which many men are slaine, and at the same time there falleth great abundance of snowe. There bee also such mightie tempestes of colde windes, that sometimes men are not able to sitte on horsebacke. Whereupon, being j^^at Qra>a neere unto the Orda (for by this name they call the signified. habitations of their Emperours and noble men) in regarde of the great winde we were constrained to lye groveling on the earth, and could not see by reason of the dust. There is never any raine in Winter, but onely in Sommer, albeit in so little quantitie, that sometimes it scarcely sufficeth to allay the dust, or to moysten the rootes of the grasse. There is often times great store of haile also. Insomuch that when the Emperour elect was to be placed in his Emperiall throne (my selfe being then present) there fell such abundance of haile, that, upon the sudden melting thereof, more then 160. persons were drowned in the same place : there were manie tentes and other thinges also caried away. Likewise, in the Sommer season there is on the sudden extreame heate, and suddenly againe intollerable colde. Of their forme, habite, and maner of living. Chap. 4. The shape of HTVHe Mongals or Tartars, in outward shape, are unlike the Tartars. A. to all other people. For they are broader betweene the eyes, and the balles of their cheekes, then men of other nations bee. They have flat and small noses, litle eyes, and eye liddes standing streight upright, they are shaven on the crownes like priests. They weare their haire somewhat longer about their eares, then upon their it growe long like foreheads : but behinde they let Their habite. womans haire, whereof they braide two lockes binding eche of them behind either eare. They have short feet also. The garments, as well of their men, as of their women are all of one fashion. They use neither cloakes, hattes, nor cappes. But they weare Jackets framed after a strange manner, of buckeram, skarlet, or Baldakines. Like unto Fro- Their shoubes or gownes are hayrie on the outside, and hshers men. O p en behinde, with tailes hanging downe their to hammes. They use not to washe their garments, neither will in any wise suffer them to bee washed, especially in the time of thunder. Their habitations bee rounde and cunningly made with wickers and staves in manner of Their tabernacles. a tent. But in the middest of the toppes thereof, they have a window open to convey the light in and the smoake out. For their fire is alwayes in the middest. Their walles bee covered with felt. Their doores are made of felte also. Some of these Tabernacles may quickely be taken asunder, and set together againe, and are caried upon beastes backes. Other some cannot be taken insunder, but are stowed upon carts. And whithersoever they goe, be it either to warre, or to any other place, they transport their tabernacles with them. They are very rich in cattel, as in camels, oxen, sheep, and Their cattell goats. And I thinke they have more horses and mares then all the world besides. But they have no kine nor other beasts. Their Emperors, Dukes, & other of their nobles doe abound with silk, gold, silver, and precious stones. Their victuals are al things that may be eaten : Their for we saw some of them eat lice. They drinke milke in victuals. great quantitie, but especially mares milke, if they have L  55-J it: They seeth Mill also in water, making it so thinne, that them they may drinke thereof. Every one of drinkes off a cup full or two in a morning, and sometime they eate nought else all the day long. But in the evening each man hath a little flesh given him to eate, and they drinke the broath thereof. Howbeit in summer time, when they have mares milke enough, they seldome eate flesh, unles perhaps it be given them, or they take some beast or bird in hunting. Of their manners both good and bad. Chap. 5. THeir manners are partly prayse-worthie, and partly Their detestable : For they are more obedient unto their obed^nc^ lords and masters, then any other either clergie or laie-people in the whole world. For they doe highly reverence them, and will deceive them, neither in wordes nor deedes. They seldome or never fall out among themselves, and, as for fightings or brawlings, wounds or manslaughters, they never happen among them. There Their Their courtesie. Their chastity. Their insolencie against strangers. in exceedingly, they not quarell found, and therefore the tabernacles and cartes of them that have any treasures are not strengthened with lockes or barres. If any beast goe astray, the finder thereof either lets it goe, or driveth it to them that are put in office for the same purpose, at whose handes the owner of the said beast demaundeth it, and without any difficultie receiveth it againe. One of them honoureth another and bestoweth banquets very familiarly and liberally, notwithstanding that good victuals are daintie and scarce among them. They are also very hardie, and when they have fasted a day or two without any maner of sustenance, they sing and are merry as if they had eaten their bellies full. In riding, they endure much cold and extreme heat. There be, in a maner, no contentions among them, and although they use commonly to be drunken, yet doe their drunkennes. Noe one of them despiseth another but helpeth and furthereth him, as much as conveniently he can. Their women are chaste, neither is there so much as a word uttered concerning their dishonestie. Some of them will notwithstanding speake filthy and immodest words. But towards other people, the said Tartars be most insolent, and they scorne and set nought by all other noble and ignoble persons whatsoever. For we saw in the Emperours court the great duke of Russia, the kings sonne of Georgia, and many great Soldanes receiving no due honour and estimation among them. So that even the very Tartars assigned to give attendance unto them, were they never so base, would alwaies goe before them, and take the upper hand of them, yea, and sometimes would constraine them to sit behinde their backes. Moreover they are angrie and of a disdainefull nature unto other people, and beyond all measure deceitfull, and treacherous towards them. They speake fayre in the beginning, but in conclusion, they sting like scorpions. For craftie they are, and full of falshood, circumventing all men whom they are able, by their sleights. Whatsoever mischiefe they entend to practise against a man, they keepe it wonderfully secrete, so that he may by no meanes provide for himselfe, nor find a remedie against their conspiracies. They are unmanerly also and uncleanly in taking their meat and their drinke, and in other actions. Drunkennes is honourable among them, and when any of them hath taken more drinke then his stomacke can well beare, hee casteth it up and falles to drinking againe. They are most intollerable exacters, most covetous possessours, and most nigardly givers. The slaughter of other people is accompted a matter of nothing with them. MOreover, Of their lawes and customes. Chap. 6. law or custome, they have this that Punishments whatsoever man or woman be manifestly taken of adultery. to in of theft. that hath committed their neare kinsfolkes except their mother, matrtmoni^ in adultery, they are punished with death. A virgine they slay likewise fornication, together with her mate. Whosoever be taken robberie or theft, is put to death without all pitie. Also, of secretes if any man disclose their secrets, especially in time of disclosed. warre, he receiveth an hundreth blowes on the backe with a bastinado, layd on by a tall fellow. In like sort when any inferiours offend in ought, they finde no favour at their superiours handes, but are punished with grievous stripes. They are joyned in matrimony to all in generall, yea, Lawes of ^ even daughter and sister by the mothers side. For they use to marrie their sister by the fathers side onely, and also the wife of their father after his decease. The yonger brother also, or some other of his kindred, is bound to marry the wife of his elder brother deceased. For, at the time of our aboad in the countrey, a certaine duke of Andreas duke Russia named Andreas, was accused before duke Baty for °fRusstaconveying the Tartars horses out of the land, and for selling them to others : and although it could not be prooved, yet was he put to death. His yonger brother and the wife of the party deceased hearing this, came Melich ^ Z7iT° T HE ENGLISH VOYAGES they both the dukedome of Russia might not be taken from them. But he commanded the youth to marrie his deceased brothers wife, and the woman also to take him unto her husband, according to the custome of the Tartars. She answered, that she had rather die, then so haynously transgresse the law. Howbeit, hee delivered her unto him, although refused as much as they could. Wherefore carying them to bed, they constrained the youth, lamenting and weeping, to lie downe and commit incest with his brothers wife. To be short, after the death of their husbands, the Tartars wives use very seldome to marrie the second time, unlesse perhaps some man takes his brothers wife or his stepmother in mariage. They make no diiFerence betweene the sonne of their wife and of their concubine, but the father gives what he pleaseth unto each one : For of late the king of Georgia having two sonnes, one lawfully begotten called Melich ; in adulterie, at his death left b ut t he o t h er D a v i d> b o r ne part of his lande unto his base sonne. Hereupon Melich (unto whome the kingdome fell by right of his mother, because it was governed before time by women) went unto the Emperour of the Tartars, David also having taken his journey unto him. Nowe both of them comming to the court and proffering large giftes, the sonne of the harlot made suite, that he might have justice, according to the custome of the Tartars. Well, sentence passed against Melich, that David being his elder brother, should have superioritie over him, and should quietly and peaceably possesse the portion of land granted unto him by his father. Whensoever a Tartar hath many wives, each one of them hath her family and dwelling place by her selfe. And sometime the Tartar eateth, drinketh and lieth with one, and sometime with another. One is accompted chiefe among the rest, with whom hee is oftener conversant, then with the other. And notwithstanding (as it hath bin said) they are many, yet do they seldome fal out among themselves. Of their superstitious traditions. Chap. 7. BUt by reason of certain traditions, which either they Ridiculous or their predecessors have devised, they accompt tra^itions' some things indifferent to be faults. One is to thrust a knife into the fire, or any way to touch the fire with a knife, or with their knife to take flesh out of the cauldron, or to hewe with an hatchet neare unto the fire. For they think by that means to take away the head or force from the fire. Another is to leane upon the whip, wherewith they beate their horses : for they ride not with spurs. Also, to touch arrowes with a whip, to take or kill yong birds, to strike an horse with ye raine of their bridle, and to breake one bone against another. Also, to powre out milke, meate, or any kinde of drinke upon the ground or to make water within their tabernacle : which whosoever doth willingly, he is slaine, but otherwise he must pay a great summe of money to the inchanter to be purified. Who likewise must cause the tabernacle with all things therein, to passe betweene two fiers. Before it be on this wise purified, no man dare once enter into it, nor conveigh any thing thereout. Besides, if any man hath a morsell given him, which he is not able to swallow, and for that cause casteth it out of his mouth, there is an hole made under his tabernacle, by which hee is drawen forth and slaine without all compassion. Likewise, whosoever treads upon the threshold of any of their dukes tabernacles, he is put to death. Many other things there be, like unto these, which they take for heinous offences. But to slay men, to invade the dominions of other people, and to rifle their goods, to transgresse the commaundements and prohibitions of God, are with them no offences at all. They know nothing concerning eternall life, and everlasting damnation, and yet they thinke, that after death they shall live in another world, that they shall multiply their cattell, that they shal eate and drinke and doe other things which living men performe here upon earth. At a new moone, or a full moone, they begin all enterprises moon/. that they take in hand, and they call the moone the Great Emperour, and worship it upon their knees. All men that abide in their tabernacles must be purified with Their custome fire : Which purification is on this wise, They kindle two of purifying, £res^ a n (j pitch two Javelines into the ground neere unto the said fires, binding a corde to the tops of the Javelines. And about the corde they tye certaine jagges of buckram, under which corde, and betweene which fires, men, beastes, and tabernacles do passe. There stand two women also, one on the right side, and another on the left casting water, and repeating certaine charmes. If any man be slaine by lightning, all that dwell in the same tabernacle with him must passe by fire in maner aforesaid. For their tabernacles, beds, and cartes, their feltes and garments, and whatsoever such things they have, are touched by no man, yea, and are abandoned by all men as things uncleane. And to bee short, they thinke that all things are to be purged by fire. Therefore, when any ambassadours, princes, or other personages whatsoever come unto them, they and their giftes must passe betweene two fires to be purified, lest peradventure they have practised some witchcraft, or have brought some poyson or other mischiefe with them. Of the beginning of their empire or government. Chap. 8. [I. 57-] The people of Tartaria. The original y the exploits of Chingis. THe East countrie, whereof wee have entreated, which is called Mongal, is reported to have had of olde time foure sortes of people. One of their companions was called Yeka Mongal, that is the great Mongals. The second company was called Sumongal, that is, the themselves Tartars of a Water-Mongals, who called certaine river running through their countrey named Tartar. The third was called Merkat, and the fourth Metrit. All these people had one and the same person, attire of body and language, albeit they were divided by princes and provinces. In the province of Yeka Mongal, there was a certaine man called Chingis. This man became a mighty hunter. For he learned to steale men, & to take them for a pray. He ranged into other countries taking as many captives as he could, and joining them unto himselfe. Also hee allured the men of his owne countrey unto him, who followed him as their captaine and ringleader to doe mischiefe. Then began he to make warre upon the Sumongals or Tartars, and slewe their captaine, and after many conflicts, subdued them them all into bondage. unto himselfe, and brought to fight against the Afterward he used their helpe Merkats, dwelling by the Tartars, whom also hee vanquished in battell. Proceeding from thence, he fought against the Metrites, and conquered them also. The The Naimani. Naimani hearing that Chingis was thus exalted, greatly disdeined thereat. For they had a mighty & puissant Emperour, unto whom all the foresaid nations payed tribute. Whose sonnes, when he was dead, succeeded him in his Empire. Howbeit, being young and foolish, they knew not howe to governe the people, but were The discord of divided, and fell at variance among themselves. Now hrethrenChingis being exalted, as is aforesaid, they neverthelesse invaded the forenamed countries, put the inhabitants to the sword, and carried away their goods for a pray. Which Chingis having intelligence of, gathered all his subjects together. The Naimani also, and the people called Karakitay assembled and banded themselves at a certaine straight valley, where, after a battell foughten they were vanquished by the Mongals. And being thus vanquished, they were, the greater part of them, slaine ; and others, which could not escape, were carried into In the land of the foresayd Karakytayans, captivitie. Occoday Cham, the sonne of Chingis Cham, after he was Occoday created Emperour, built a certaine citie, which he called ^h Chanyl. Neare unto which citie, on the South side, there is an huge desert, wherein wilde men are certainely reported to inhabite, which cannot speake at all, and are destitute of joynts in their legges, so that if they fall, they cannot rise alone by themselves.

Of the mutuall victories betweene them, and the people of Kythay. Chap. 9. BUt the Mongals returning home into their owne countrey, prepared themselves to battell against the *Kythayans : Which their Emperour hearing, set forward against them with his armie, and they fought a cruell battell, wherein the Mongals were overcome, and all their nobles in the armie, except seven, were slaine. And for this cause, when they, purposing to invade anie region, are threatned by the inhabitants thereof to be slaine, they doe, to this day, answere : in old time also our whole number besides being slaine, we remayned but seven of us alive, and yet notwithstanding we are now growen unto a great multitude, thinke not therefore to daunt us with such brags. But Chingis and the residue that remained alive, fled home into their countrey : And having breathed him a little, he prepared himselfe to warre, and went forth against the people called Huyri : These men were Christians of the sect of Nestorius. And these also the Mongals overcame, and received letters or learning from them : for before that time they had not the arte of writing, and nowe they call it the hand or letters of the Mongals. Immediately after, hee marched against the countrey of Saruyur, and of the Karanites, and against the land of Hudirat; all which he vanquished. Then returned he home into his owne countrey, and breathed himselfe. Afterward, assembling his warlike troupes, they marched with one accord against the Kythayans, and waging warre with them a long time, they conquered a great part of their land, and shut up their Emperour into his greatest citie : which citie they had so long time besieged, that they began to want necessary provision for their ( th e '^T^ armie. And when they had no victuals to feede upon, Chingis Cham commaunded his souldiers, that they should eate every tenth man of the companie. But they of the [I. 58.] citie fought manfully against them, with engines, dartes, and arrowes, and when stones wanted they threw silver, Sifver cast at and especially melted silver : for the same citie abounded with great riches. Also, when the Mongals had fought a long time and could not prevayle by warre, they made a great trench underneath the ground from the armie unto the middest of the citie, and there issuing foorth they fought against the citizens, and the remnant also without the walles fought in like manner. At last, breaking open the gates of the citie, they entred, and putting the Emperour, with many other to the sworde, they tooke possession thereof and conveighed away the golde, silver, and all the riches therein. And having appointed certaine deputies over the countrey, they returned home into their owne lande. This is the first time, when the Emperour of the Kythayans being vanquished, Chingis Cham ob- Chingis Cham tayned the Empire.

But he sent his other sonne with an armie India minor. against These Indians are the blacke Saracens, which are also called ^Ethiopians. But here the armie marched forward to fight against Christians dwelling in India major. Which the King of that countrey hearing (who is commonly called Presbiter John) gathered his souldiers together, and came jle s et eack Q£ ^iQm upon a saddle on horsebacke, and put fire within them, and placed a man with a paire of bellowes on the horse backe behinde every image. And so with many horses and images in such sorte furnished, they marched on to fight against the Mongals or Tartars. And comming neare unto the place of the battell, they first of all sent those horses in order one after another. But the men that sate behind laide I wote not what upon the fire within the images, and blew strongly with their bellowes. Whereupon it came to passe, that the men and the horses were burnt with wilde fire, and the ayre was darkened with smoake. Then the Indians cast dartes upon the Tartars, of whom many were wounded and slain. And so they expelled them out of their dominions with great confusion, neither did we heare, that ever they returned thither againe. How being repelled by monstrous men shapen like dogs, they overcame the people of Burithabeth. Chap. 11. BUt returning through the deserts, they came into a certaine countrey, wherin (as it was reported unto us in the Emperours court, by certaine clergie men of Russia, and others, who were long time among them, and that by A strange strong and stedfast affirmation) 1/ ir they found certaine report of ceri_  *r i_ 1 J tain monstrous tain monstrous womn anj monsters resembling women : who being asked by many wom interpreters, where the men of that land were, they dogs. answered, that whatsoever women were borne there, were indued with the shape of mankinde, but the males were like unto dogges. And delaying the time, in that countrey they met with the said dogges on the other side of the river. And in the midst of sharpe winter, they cast themselves into the water : Afterward they wallowed in the dust upon the maine land, and so the dust being mingled with water, was frozen to their backes, and having often times so done, the ice being strongly frozen upon them, with great fury they came to fight against the Tartars. And when the Tartars threwe their dartes, or shot their arrowes among them, they rebounded backe againe, as if they had [I. 59.] lighted upon stones. And the rest of their weapons coulde by no meanes hurt them. Howbeit, the Dogges made an assault upon the Tartars, and wounding some of them with their teeth, and slaying others, at length they drave them out of their countries. And thereupon they have a Proverbe of the same matter, as yet rife among them, which they speake in jesting sorte one to another ; My father or my brother was slaine of Dogges. The women which they tooke, they brought into their owne countrey, who remayned there till their dying day. And in traveiling homewardes, the sayd armie of the Mongals came unto The re&on °f the lande of Burithabeth (the inhabitants whereof are BurithabethPagans) and conquered the people in battell. These of the people. Another THE ENGLISH VOYAGES custome. For when anie mans father deceaseth, he assembleth all his kindred, and they eate him. These m en have no beards at all, for we saw them carie a certaine iron instrument in their hands, wherewith, if any haires growe upon their chinne, they presently plucke them out. They are also very deformed. From thence the Tartars armie returned to their owne home. How they had the repulse at the Caspian mountaynes, and were driven backe by men dwell- ing in caves. Chap. 12. Oreover Chingis Cham, at the same time when he s e nt o t h er t he East> h ee hi*nselfe a r m i es a g a i n st marched with a power into the lande of Kergis, which notwithstanding, he conquered not in that expedition, and as it was reported unto us, he went on forward even to the Caspian mountaines. But the mountaines on that part where they encamped themselves, were of adamant, and therefore they drew unto them their arrowes, and weapons of iron. And certaine men contained within those Caspian mountaynes, hearing, as it was thought, the noyse of the armie, made a breach through, so that when the Tartars returned unto the same place tenne yeeres after, they found the mountaine broken. And attempting to goe unto them, they could not : for there stood a cloud before them, beyond which they were not able to passe, being deprived of their sight so soone as they approched thereunto. But they on the contrary side thinking that the Tartars durst not come nigh them, gave the assault, & when they came at the cloud, they could not proceed for the cause aforesaid. Also the Tartars, before they came unto the said mountaines, passed for the space of a moneth and more, through a vast wildernes, & departing thence towards the East, they were above a moneth travelling through another huge desert. At length, they came unto a land wherin they saw beaten waies, but could not find any people. Howbeit, at the last, diligently seeking, they found a man & his wife, whom they presented before Chingis Cham : and demanding of them where the people of that countrey were, they answered, that the people inhabited under the ground in mountains. Then Chingis Cham keeping still the woman, sent her husband unto them, giving them charge to come at his command. And going unto them, he declared all things that Chingis Cham had commanded them. But they answered, that they would upon such a day visite him, to satisfie his desire. And in the meane season, by blinde & hidden passages under the earth, assembling themselves, they came against the Tartars in warlike manner, and suddenly issuing forth, they slewe a great number of them. This people were not able to endure the terrible noise, which in that place the Sunne made at his uprising : for at the time of the A fabulous Sunne rising, they were inforced to lay one eare upon the nefrrattonof ground, and to stoppe the other close, least they should heare that dreadfull sound. Neither could they so escape, for by this meanes many of them were destroyed. Chingis Cham therefore and his company, seeing that they prevailed not, but continually lost some of their number, fled and departed out of that land. But the man and his wife aforesaid they caried along with them, who all their life time continued in the Tartars countrey. Being demaunded why the men of their countrey doe inhabite under the ground, they sayd, that at a certeine time of the yeare, when the sunne riseth, there is such an huge noyse, that the people cannot endure it. Moreover, they use to play upon cymbals, drums, and other musicall instruments, to the ende they may not heare that sounde. Of the statutes of Chingis Cham, of his death, of his sonnes, and of his dukes. Chap. 13. BUt as Chingis Cham returned out of that countrey, his people wanted victuals, & suffered extreme famin. Then by chance they found ye fresh intrails of a beast : which they tooke, & casting away the dung therof, caused it to be sodden, brought it before Chingis Cham, & did The iawe of eat therof. And hereupon Chingis Cham enacted ; that The death of Chingis. His sonnes. His graundchildren. The Tartartan dukes. THE ENGLISH VOYAGES neither the blood, nor the intrails, nor any other part of a beast which might be eaten, should be cast away, save onely the dunge. Wherefore he returned thence into his owne land, and there he ordayned lawes and statutes, which the Tartars doe most strictly and inviolably observe, of the which we have before spoken. He was afterward slaine by a thunderclap. He had foure sonnes : the first was called Occoday, the second Thossut Can, the third Thiaday : the name of the fourth is unknowen. From these foure descended all the dukes of the Mongals. The first sonne of Occoday is Cuyne, who is now Emperour : his brothers be Cocten and Chyrinen. The sonnes of Thossut Can are Bathy, Ordu, Siba, and Bora. Bathy, next unto the Emperour, is richer and mightier then all the rest. But Ordu is the seignior of all the dukes. The sonnes of Thiaday be Hurin and Cadan. The sonnes of Chingis Cham his other sonne, whose name is unknowen, are Mengu, Bithat, and certaine others. The mother of Mengu was named Seroctan, and of all others most honoured among the Tartars, except the Emperors mother, and mightier then any subject except Bathy. These be the names of the dukes : Ordu, who was in Poland and in Hungarie : Bathy also & Hurin & Cadan, and Siban, and Ouygat, all which were in Hungarie. In like maner Cyrpodan, who is as yet beyond the sea, making war against certaine Soldans of the Saracens, and other inhabitants of farre countries. Others remained in the land, as namely Mengu, Chyrinen, Hubilai, Sinocur, Cara, Gay, Sybedey, Bora, Berca, Corrensa. There be many other of their dukes, whose names are unknowen unto us.

For no XRmper7urover m an ^a re a&de in any place, unles he hath assigned him his subjects. to be there. Also he himselfe appointeth to his dukes wonderfull dominion over all his subjects. where they should inhabite.

Whatsoever is given them in charge, whensoever, or wheresoever, be it to fight or to lose their lives, or howsoever it be, they obey without any gainsaying. For if he demandeth any mans daughter, or sister being a virgine, they presently deliver her unto him without all contradiction : yea, often times he makes a collection of virgines throughout all the Tartars dominions, and those whom he meanes to keepe, he retaineth unto himselfe, others he bestoweth upon his men. Also, whatsoever messenger he sendeth, or whithersoever, his subjects must without delay finde them horses and other necessaries. In like sorte, from what countrey soever tribute payers, or ambassadours come unto him, they must have horses, carriages, and expenses allowed them. Notwithstanding ambassadours comming from other places do suffer great misery, and are in much wante both of victuals, and of apparel : especially when they come to any of the dukes, and there they are constrayned to make some lingering abode. Then ten men Their are allowed so little sustenance, that scarcely two could ^ar^arous live thereof. Likewise, if any injuries be offered them, Awards' ** they cannot without danger make complaint. Many gifts ambassadours. also are demaunded of them, both by dukes and others, which if they doe not bestow, they are basely esteemed, and set at nought. And hereupon, wee were of necessitie enforced to bestowe in giftes a great part of those things which were given us by well disposed people, to defray our charges. To be short, all things are so in the power and possession of the Emperour, that no man dare say, This is mine, or, this is my neighbours ; but all, both goods, cattell and men are his owne. Concerning this matter also he published a statute of late. The very same authority and jurisdiction, doe the dukes in like ceeded his father. The expedition of Bathy. The citie of Barchin. [i. 6I. Ornc. T HE ENGLISH VOYAGES Of the election of Emperour Occoday, and of the expedition of duke Bathy. Chap. 15. AFter the death of Chingis Cham aforesayd, the dukes assembled themselves and chose Occoday his sonne to be their Emperour. And he, entering into consultation with his nobles, divided his armies, and sent duke Bathy his nephew against the countrie of Altisoldan, and against the people called Bisermini, who were Saracens, but spake the language of Comania. The Tartars invading their countrey, fought with them and subdued them in battel. But a certeine citie called Barchin resisted them a long time. For the citizens had cast up many ditches and trenches about their citie, in regard whereof the Tartars could not take it, till they had filled the said ditches. But the citizens of Sarguit hearing this, came foorth to meete them, yeelding themselves unto them of their citie was not their owne accord. Whereupon destroyed, but they slue manie of them and others they carried away captive, and taking spoyles, they filled the citie with other inhabitants, and so marched foorth against the citie of Orna. This towne was very populous and exceeding rich. For there were many Christians therein, as namely Gasarians, Russians, and Alanians, with others, and Saracens also. The government of the citie was in the Saracens hande. It standeth upon a mighty river, and is a kinde of porte towne, having a great marte exercised therein. And when the Tartars could not otherwise overcome it, they turned the said river, running through the citie, out of his chanell, and so drowned the citie with the inhabitantes and their goods. Which being done, they set forward against Russia, and made foule havocke there, destroying cities and castles and murthering the people. They layd siege a long while unto Kiow the chiefe citie of Russia, and at length they tooke it and slue the citizens. Whereupon, travelling through that countrey, wee found an innumerable multitude of dead they from thence, invaded towards Returning the maSnaFrom hence they proceeded them also. And so going on maSnaa very large and a populous citie, but it is nowe in a maner brought to nothing : for there doe scarce remaine 200. houses, the inhabitants whereof are kept in extreame bondage. Moreover, out of Russia and Comania, they proceeded forward against the Hungarians, and the Polonians, and there manie of them were slaine, as is aforesaid : and had the Hungarians manfully withstood them, the Tartars had beene confounded and driven backe. the countrey of the Morduans being pagans, and conquered The them in battell. Then they marched against the people Morduanscalled Byleri, or Bulgaria magna, & utterly wasted the Bulgaria countrey. North against the people called Bastarci or Hungaria Hungaria magna, and conquered further North, they came unto the Parossitse, who having Parossita. little stomacks and small mouthes, eate not any thing at all, but seething flesh they stand or sitte over the potte, and receiving the steame or smoke thereof, are therewith onely nourished, and if they eate anie thing it is very little. From hence they came to the Samogetae, who live Samogeta?. onely upon hunting, and use to dwell in tabernacles onely, and to weare garments made of beastes skinnes. From thence they proceeded unto a countrey lying upon the Ocean sea, where they found certaine monsters, who in The North all things resembled the shape of men, saving that their oceanfeete were like the feete of an oxe, and they had in deede mens heads but dogges faces. They spake, as it were, Northern? two words like men, but at the third they barked like monsters. dogges. From hence there some of them remaine unto this day. Of the expedition of duke Cyrpodan. Chap. 16. into Comania, and they retired AT the same time Occoday Can sent duke Cyrpodan Kergis. with an armie against Kergis, who also subdued them in battell. These men are Pagans, having no beardes at all. They have a custome when any of their drawe as it were, a leather thong overthwart their faces, from one eare to the other. This nation being conquered, duke Cyrpodan marched with his forces South- ward against the Armenians. And travailing through certain desert places, they found monsters in the shape of men, which had each of them but one arme & one hand growing out of the midst of their breast, and but one foote. Two of them used to shoote in one bowe, and they ran so swiftly, that horses could not overtake them. They ran also upon that one foote by hopping and leaping, and being weary of such walking, they went upon their hand and their foote, turning themselves round, as it were in a circle. And being wearie of so doing, they ran againe according to their wonted manner. Isidore calleth them Cyclopedes. And as it was told us in court, by the clergie men of Russia, who remaine with the foresayd Emperour, many ambassadours were sent from them unto the Emperours court, to obtaine peace. From thence they proceeded forth into Armenia, which they conquered in battell, and part also of Georgia. And the other part is under their jurisdiction, paying as yet every yeare unto them for tribute, 20000. pieces of coyne called Yperpera. From thence they marched into the dominions of the puissant and mighty Soldan called Deurum, whom also they vanquished in fight. And to be short, they went on farther sacking and conquering, even unto the Soldan of Aleppo his dominions, and now they have subdued that land also, determining to invade other countries beyond it : neither returned they afterward into their owne land unto this day. Likewise the same armie the Caliph of Baldach his marched forward against countrey, which they subdued also, & exacted at his handes the daylie tribute of 400. Byzantines, besides Baldakines and other giftes. Also every yeare they send messengers unto the Caliph moving him to come unto them. Who sending back great gifts together with his tribute beseecheth them to be favourable unto him. Howbeit the Tartarian Emperour receiveth al his gifts, Cyclopedes. Armenia Georgia conquered. The Soldan of Aleppo his land. The Caliph of & yet still nevertheles sends for him, to have him come. H ow the Tartars behave themselves in warre. Chap. 17.

And when they joine battel against any other nation, unles they do all with one consent give backe, every man that flies is put to death. And if one or two, or more of ten proceed manfully to the battel, but the residue of those ten draw backe & follow not the company, they are in like maner slaine. Also, if one among ten or more bee taken, their fellowes, if they rescue them not, are punished with death. Moreover they are enjoined to have these weapons following. Two long bowes or one Their good one at the least, three quivers full of arrowes, & one axe, and ropes to draw engines withal. But the richer sort have single edged swords, with sharpe points, and somewhat crooked. They have also armed horses with their shoulders and breasts defenced, they have helmets and brigandines. Some of them have jackes, and caparisons for their horses made of leather artificially doubled or trebled upon their bodies. The upper part of their helmet is of iron or steele, but that part which compasseth about the necke and the throate is of leather. Howbeit some of them have all their foresaide furniture of iron framed in maner following. They beate out many thinne plates a finger broad, and a handful long, and making in every one of them eight little holes, they put thereunto three strong and streight leather thongs. So they joine the plates one to another, as it that the said they skowre thong unto another, unto thongs, with other small and slender thongs, drawen through the holes aforesayd, and in the upper part, on each side therof, they fasten one small doubled the plates may firmely be knit together. These they make, as well for their horses caparisons, as for the armour of their men : And that a man may them so bright behold his face in them. Some of them upon the necke of their launce have an hooke, wherewithal! they attempt to pull men out of their saddles. The heads of their arrowes are exceedingly sharpe cutting both wayes like a two edged sworde, and they alwaies carie a file in their quivers to whet their arrowheads. They have targets made of wickers, or of small roddes. Howbeit they doe not (as we suppose) accustome to carrie them, but onely about the tents, or in the Emperours or dukes guardes, & that only in the night season. They are most politique in warres, having bene exercised Their experience fcf herein with other nations for cunning in zvarres Their maner °^ c o m P a n y have a round and of passing owr leather, about the borders whereof making many loopes, rivers. yeres.

This their boate they tye unto an horse tayle, causing a man to swimme before, & to guide over the horse, or sometime they have two oares to row themselves over. The first horse therefore being driven into the water, all the other horses of the company followe him, and so they passe through the river. But the poorer sort of common souldiers have every man his leather bag or sachell well sowen together, wherin he packs up all his trinkets, and strongly trussing it up hangs it at his horses tayle, and so passeth over, in maner aforesaid. Howe they may be resisted. Chap. 18. ^^ them it, with them, utterly wasting they greatly dread, & with if Christians would withstande Counsel how I Deeme not any one kingdome or province able to resist them : because they use to take up souldiers out of every countrey of their dominions. And if so be the neighbour province which they invade, wil not aide the inhabitants therof, whom they take from thence with them, they proceed on to fight against another countrey. And placing their captives in the forefront of the battell, if they fight not couragiously, they put to the sworde. Wherefore, them, it is expedient, that the provinces and governours t0 w?&e warre of countreies should agree in one, and so by common counsell, should give them resistance. Their souldiers also must be furnished with strong hand-bowes & crosbowes, which sufficient arrowes, with maces also of good iron, or an axe with a long handle or staffe. When they make their arrow A notable heads, they must (according to ye Tartars custome) dip temper of inn them red-hot into water mingled with sake, that they or 5teelemay be strong to pierce the enemies armour. They that wil may have swords also & lances with hooks at the ends, to pull them from their saddles, out of which they are easilie removed. They must have helmets likewise & other armour to defend themselves & their horses from the Tartars weapons & arrowes, & they that are unarmed, must (according to ye Tartars custome) march behinde their fellowes, and discharge at the enemie with [I. 63.] long bowes and cros-bowes. And (as it is above said of the Tartars) they must orderly dispose their bandes and lawes for their souldiers. Whosoever runneth to the pray or spoyle, before the victorie be atchieved, must undergoe a most severe punishment. For such a fellow is put to death among the Tartars without all pitie or mercie. The place of battel must be chosen, if it be possible, in a plaine fielde, where they may see round about, neither must all be in one company, but in manie and severall bandes, not very farre distant one from another. They which give the first encounter must sende one band before, and must have another in a readynesse to relieve and second the former in time convenient. They must have spies also on every side to give them notice when the rest of the enemies bandes approch. For therefore ought they alwayes to send forth band against band & troupe against troupe, because the Tartar ever practiseth to gette his enemie in the midst and so to environ him. Let our bands take this caveat also, if the enemie retire, not to make any long pursuit after him, lest peradventure (according to his custome) he might draw them into some secret ambush : for the Tartar fights more by policie then by maine force. And againe, lest our horses bee tired : for we are not so well stored with horses as they. Those horses which the Tartars use one day, they ride not upon three or the Tartars draw if foure dayes after. Moreover, homeward, our men must not therefore depart and casseir their bandes, or separate themselves asunder: because they doe this upon policie, namely to have our armie divided, that they may more securely invade and waste the countrey. And in very deede, our captaines ought both day and night to keepe their armie in a readines : and not to lie out of their armour, but at all assayes, to bee provided for battell. For the Tartars like divels are alwaies watching and devising howe to practise mischiefe. Furthermore, if in battell any of the Tartars be cast ofF their horse backes, they must presently bee layd holde on and taken, for being on foote they shoote strongly, wounding and killing both horses and men. * Johannes de piano Carpini Of the journey of frier *John unto the first g u a rd of h T h ^\\ 7"E therefore by the commaundement of the sea VV apostolique setting foorth towards the nations of the East, chose first to travel unto the Tartars, because W ate°$ that therefore, we came there might be great danger imminent The journey of them, by their fiierMn tf to the i/e we feared upon the Church of God next unto invasions. Proceeding on king of Bohemia, who being of our familiar acquaintance, advised us to take our journey through Polonia in Polonia, by For we had kinsfolkes and Russia. whose assistance, we might enter into Russia. Having given us his letters, hee caused our charges also to be defrayed, in all his chiefe houses and cities, till we came unto his nephew Boleslaus duke of Slesia, who Boleslaus duke also was familiar and well knowen unto us. The like °fSliestafavour he shewed us also, till wee came unto Conradus duke of * Lautiscia, unto whome then (by Gods especiall * Mazoma. towards us) lord Wasilico duke of Russia was favour come, large from whose mouth we heard more at concerning the deedes of the Tartars : for he had sent ambassadours thither, who were returned backe unto him. Wherefore, it being given us to understand, that we must bestow giftes upon them, we caused certaine skinnes of bevers and other beastes to be bought with part of that money, which was given upon almes to succour us by the way. Which thing duke Conradus and the * duches Grims/aua. of Cracow, and a bishop, and certaine souldiers being advertised of, gave us likewise more of the same skins. And to be short, duke Wasilico being earnestly requested by the duke of Cracow, and by the bishop and barons, on our behalfe, conducted us with him, unto his owne land, and there for certaine daies, enterteined us at his owne charges, to the ende that we might refresh our selves a while. And when, being requested by us, he had caused his bishops to resort unto him, we reade before them the Popes letters, admonishing them to returne unto the unitie of the Church. To the same purpose also, we our selves admonished them, and to our abilitie, induced as well the duke as the bishops and others thereunto. Howbeit because duke Daniel the Daniel brother of Wasilico aforesaid (having as then taken his broth^r unt0 journey unto Baty) was absent, they could not at that time, sent us forward with one of his servants as farre as Kiow the chiefe citie of Russia. Howbeit we went alwayes in danger of our lives by reason of the Lituanians, who did The Lithuanians, often invade ye borders of Russia, even in those verie places by which we were to passe. But in regard of the foresayd servant, wee were out of the Russians daunger, the greatest part of whome were either slaine, or caried into captivitie by the Tartars. Moreover, at Danilon wee were feeble even unto the death. (Notwithstanding wee caused our selves to bee carried in a waggon through the snowe and extreme colde.) And being come unto Kiow, wee consulted with the Millenary, & other noble men there concerning our journey. They told us, that if wee carried those horses, which wee then had, unto the Tartars, great store of snowe lying upon the ground, they would all dye : be cause they knew not howe to digge up the grasse under The fodder of the snow, as the Tartarian horses doe, neither could there the Tartarian bee OUght found for them to eate, the Tartars having neither orses' [I. 64.] hay nor strawe, nor any other fodder. We determined therefore to leave them behind at Kiow with two servants appointed to keepe them. And wee were constrayned to bestow gifts upon the Millenary, that we might obtaine his favour to allowe us poste horses and a guide. Wherefore beginning our journey the second daye after the feast of the Purification, wee arrived at the towne of Canow, which was immediatly under the dominion of the Tartars. The governour whereof allowed us horses and a guide unto Mkhteas the another towne, wherein wee found one Michaeas to be governour, a man full of all malice and despight. Who ma icious. notwithstanding, having received giftes at our handes, according to his maner conducted us to the first guarde of the Tartars. H ow he and his c o m p a ny were at the first received of the Tartars. C h a p. 20. WHerefore, the first Saturday next after Ash Wednesday, having about the Sunnes going downe, taken up our place of rest, the armed Tartars came rushing upon us in uncivil and horrible maner, being very inquisitive of us what maner of persons, or of what condition we were : & when we had answered them that we were the Popes Legates, receiving some victuals at our handes, they immediatly departed. Moreover in the morning rising and proceeding on our journey, the chiefe of them which were in the guard met with us, demaunding why, or for what intent and purpose we came thither ? and what busines we had with them ? Unto whom we answered, We are the legates of our lord the Pope, who is the father & lord of the Christians. He hath sent us as well unto your The contents Emperour, as to your princes, and all other Tartars for °fthe leSactethis purpose, because it is his pleasure, that all Christians should be in league with the Tartars, and should have peace with them. It is his desire also that they should become great or in favour with God in heaven, therfore he admonisheth them aswel by us, as by his own letters, to become Christians, and to embrace the faith of our Lord Jesu Christ, because they could not otherwise be saved. Moreover, he gives them to understand, that he much mar- veileth at their monstrous slaughters & massacres of mankind, & especially of Christians, but most of al of Hungarians, Mountaineirs, & Polonians, being al his subjects, having not injuried them in ought, nor attempted to doe them injurie. And because the Lord God is grievously offended thereat, he adviseth them from henceforth to beware of such dealing, & to repent them of that which they had done. He requesteth also, that they would write an answere unto him, what they purpose to doe hereafter, and what their intention is. All which things being heard and understood, the Tartars sayd that they would appoint us poste horses and a guide unto Corrensa. And immedi- Comma. ately demanding gifts at our hands, they obtained them. Then receiving the same horses, from which they dismounted, together with a guide wee tooke our journey unto Corrensa. But they riding a swift pace, sent a messenger before unto the sayd duke Corrensa, to signifie iheWesterne the message, which we had delivered unto them. This marches. 1 161 duke is governour of all them, which lie in guard against the nations of the West, least some enemy might on the sudden and at unawares breake in upon them. And hee is said to have 60000. men under him. H ow they were received at the court of Corrensa. Chap. 21. BEing come therefore unto his court, hee caused our tent to bee placed farre from him, and sent his agents to demaund of us with what we would incline unto him, that is to say, what giftes we would offer, in doing our obeisance unto him. Unto whome wee answered, that our lord the Pope had not sent any giftes at all, because he was not certaine that wee should ever bee able to come at them : for we passed through most dangerous places. Notwithstanding, to our abilitie, we will honour him with some part of those things, which have bene, by the goodnes of God, & the favour of the Pope, bestowed upon us for our sustenance. Having received our gifts, they conducted us unto the Orda or tent of the duke, & we were instructed to bow thrise with our left knee before the doore of the tente, and in any case to beware, lest wee set our foote upon the threshold of the sayd doore. And that after we were entred, wee should rehearse before the duke and all his nobles, the same wordes, which wee had before sayde, kneeling upon our knees. Then presented wee the letters of our lord the Pope : but our interpreter whome we had hired and brought with us from Kiow was not sufficiently able to interpret them, neither was there any other esteemed to bee meete for the same purpose. Here certaine poste horses and three Tartars were appoynted for us to conduct us from hence with al speede unto duke Bathy. This Bathy is the mightiest prince among them except the Emperour, & they are bound to obey him before all other princes. We began our journey towards his court the first tuesday in Lent, and riding as fast as our horses could trot (for we had fresh horses almost thrise or foure times a day) we posted from morning till night, yea very often in 162 The maner of saluting the Tartarian princes.

The fourth is called JIaec, upon %Rhymnus. which two Millenaries doe march, on each side of the river one. All these, in the winter time, descend down to the sea, & in summer ascend backe by the bankes of the said rivers up to the mountains. The sea last named is the II Great sea, out of which the arme of S. George proceedeth, \\Pontus which runneth by Constantinople.

Unto whom we answered, that to the end we might cleare ourselves from all suspition of any such matter, we were contented to passe through. When therefore we were come unto the Orda, being demanded by his agent Eldegay with what present or gift we would do our obeisance ? Wee gave the same answere which we did at the court of Corrensa. The gifts being given and received, the causes of our journey also being heard, they brought us into the tabernacle of the prince, first bowing our selves at the doore, & being admonished, as before, not to tread upon the threshold. And being entred, we spake unto him kneeling upon our knees, & delivered him our letters, and requested him to have interpreters to translate them. Who accordingly on good friday were sent unto us, and we together with them, diligently translated our sayd letters into the Russian, Tartarian, and Saracen languages. This interpretation was presented unto Bathy, which he read, & attentively noted. At length wee were conducted home againe unto our owne lodging, howbeit no victuals were given unto us, except it were once a litle Millet in a dich, the first night of our comming. This Bathy caries himselfe very stately & magnificently, having porters and all officers after the maner of the Emperour, and sittes in a lofty seate or throne together with one of his wives. The rest, namely, as well his brethren and sonnes, as other great personages sit underneath him in the midst upon a bench, and others sit downe upon the ground, behinde him, but the men on the right hand and the women on the left. He hath very faire and large tentes of linnen cloth also, which were once the kings of Hungaria. Neither dare any man come into his tent (besides them of his owne family) unles he be called, be he never so mighty and great, except perhaps it be knowen that it is his pleasure. Wee also, for the same cause, sate on the left hand; for so doe all ambassadors in going: but in returning from the Emperour, we were . . . '.  , . , , J J. A. alwaies placed on the right hand.

And alwaies, when hee rides, there is a canopie or small tent caried over his head upon the point of a javeline. And so doe all the great princes of the Tartars, & their wives also. The sayd Bathy is courteous enough unto his owne men, and yet is hee had in great awe by them : he is most cruel in fight: he is exceedingly prudent and politique in warre, because he hath now continued a long time in martiall affaires. How departing from Bathy, they passed through [I. 66.] the sound oj the land of Comania, and of the Kangittae. Chap. 23. MOreover, upon Easter even we were called unto the tent, and there came forth to meete us the foresaid agent of Bathy, saying on his masters behalfe, that we should go into their land, unto the Emperor Cuyne, deteining certaine of our company with this pretence, that they would send them backe unto the Pope, to whom we gave letters of al our afFaires to deliver unto him. But being come as farre as duke Montii aforesaid, there they They travelled were kept untill our returne. Upon Easter day, having post from 4-u Easter day to 0/ju/v A  A 4. 1 ^ A u 1 c i ' teares, not knowing Volga, said our praiers, and taken a slender breakfast, in the the22 company of two Tartars, which were assigned unto us by Eastward of Corensa we departed with many whether we went to death or to life. And we were so feeble in bodie, that we were scarce able to ride. For all that Lent through, our meat was Millet onely with a little water and sake. And so likewise upon other fasting dayes. Neither had we ought to drinke, but snowe melted in a skillet. And passing through Comania we rode most earnestly, having change of horses five times or oftener in a day, except when we went through deserts, for of Comania. The North Ocean. The land of the Kangitta. Jeroslaus duke of Russia. THE ENGLISH VOYAGES then we were allowed better and stronger horses, which could undergoe the whole labour. And thus farre had we travailed from the beginning of Lent untill eight dayes after Easter. The land of Comania on the North side immediately after Russia, hath the people called Morduyni is, Bulgaria magna, the Bastarci, that is, Byleri, that Hungaria magna, next unto the Bastarci, the Parositae and the Samogetae. Next unto the Samogetae are those people which are sayd to have dogges faces, inhabiting upon the desert shores of the Ocean. On the South side it hath the Alani, the Circassi, the Gazari, Greece and Constantinople ; also the land of Iberia, the Cathes, the Brutaches who are said to be Jewes shaving their heads all over, the landes also of Scythia, of Georgia, of Armenia, of Turkic On the West side it hath Hungaria, and Russia. Also Comania is a most large and long countrey. The inhabitantes whereof called Comani the Tartars slewe, some notwithstanding fled from them, and the rest were subdued under their bondage. But most of them that fled are returned againe. Afterward wee entred the lande of the Kangittae, which in many places hath great scarcetie of waters, wherin there are but fewe inhabitants by reason of the foresayd defect of water. For this cause divers of the servants of Jeroslaus duke of Russia, as they were traveiling towards him into the land of Tartaria, died for thirst, in that desert. As before in Comania, so likewise in this countrey, wee found many skulles and bones of dead men lying upon the earth like a dunghill. Through this countrey we were traveiling from the eight day after Easter untill Ascension day. The inhabitants therof were Pagans, and neither they nor the Comanians used to till the ground, but lived onely upon cattell, neither built they any houses but dwelled in tents. These men also have the Tartars rooted out, and doe possesse and inhabite their countrey, howbeit, those that remained are reduced into their bondage. How they came unto the first court of the new Emperour. Chap. 24. MOreover, out of the land of the Kangittae, we entered Tkelandoftke into the countrey of ye Bisermini, who speake the Btsermtm. language of Comania, but observe the law of the Saracens. In this countrey we found innumerable cities with castles ruined, & many towns left desolate. The lord of this country was called Soldan Alti, who with al his progenie, AM Soldanus. was destroyed by the Tartars. This country hath most huge mountains. On the South side it hath Jerusalem Huge mounand Baldach, and all the whole countrey of the Saracens. taines- In the next territories adjoyning doe inhabite two carnall brothers dukes of the Tartars, namely, Burin and Cadan, Burin and the sonnes of Thyaday, who was the sonne of Chingis CadanCan. On the North side thereof it hath the land of the blacke Kythayans, and the Ocean. In the same countrie The North Syban the brother of Bathy remaineth. Through this °*ean- . J Syban brother r A ^  -rr 1 ^ r  . countrie we were travelling rrom the reast or Ascension, £nt0 Bat^ until eight daies before the feast of S. John Baptist. And then we entred into the land of the blacke Kythayans, in The blacke which the Emperour built an house, where we were called ^ ayansin to drinke. Also the Emperours deputy in that place caused the chiefe men of the citie and his two sonnes to daunce before us. Departing from hence, wee founde a certaine small sea, upon the shore whereof stands a little A small sea, mountaine. In which mountaine is reported to be a hole, from whence, in winter time such vehement tempests of winds doe issue, that traveilers can scarcely, and with great In summer time, the danger passe by the same way. noise in deede of the winde is heard there, but it proceedeth gently out of the hole. Along the shores of the foresaid sea we travailed for the space of many dayes, which Many dayes. although it bee not very great, yet hath it many islandes, and wee passed by leaving it on our left hande. In this lande dwelleth Ordu, whome wee sayde to bee auncient unto all the Tartarian dukes. And it is the Orda or court of his father which hee inhabiteth, and one of his T HE ENGLISH VOYAGES wives beareth rule there. For it is a custome among the Tartars, that the Courts of Princes or of noble men are not dissolved, but alwayes some women are appointed to keepe and governe them, upon whom certain gifts are bestowed, in like sort as they are given unto their Lords. * rpr r . 1 he first court of the And so at length we arrived at the first court of the Emperour, Emperour, wherein one of his wives dwelt. ir 1 1 r , 1 i Howe they came unto Cuyne himselfe, who was to be chosen Emperour. Chap. forthwith B1>Ut because we had not as yet seene the Emperour, " they would not invite us nor admit us into his Orda, but caused good attendance and entertainement, after the Tartars fashion, to be given unto us in our owne tent, and they caused us to stay there, and to refresh our selves with them one day. Departing thence upon the even of The land of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, wee entered into the land of Naymani. fl\e Naymani, who are Pagans. But upon the very feast day of the saide Apostles, there fel a mightie snowe in that place, and wee had extreame colde weather. This lande is full of mountaines, and colde beyonde measure, and there is little plaine ground to bee seene. These two nations last mentioned used not to till their grounde, but, like unto the Tartars, dwelt in tents, which the sayde Tartars had destroyed. Through this countrey wee were travailing manie dayes. Then entered wee into the lande of the Mongals, whome wee call Tartars. Through the Tartars lande wee continued our travaile (as wee suppose) for the space of some three weekes, riding alwayes hastily and The 22. of with speede, and upon the day of Marie Magdalene we July. arrived at the court of Cuyne the Emperour elect. But therefore did we make great haste all this way, because our Tartarian guides were straightly commaunded to bring us unto the court Imperiall with all speede, which court hath beene these many yeeres, ordained for the election of the Emperour. Wherefore rising earely, wee travailed untill night without eating of any thing, and oftentimes wee came so late unto our lodging, that we had no time to eate the same night, but that which we should have eaten over night, was given us in the morning. And often changing our horses, wee spared no Horse-fleshe, but rode swiftly and without intermission, as fast as our horses could trot. H ow Cuyne enterteined the Minorite Friers. Chap. 26. BUt when wee were come unto the court of Cuyne, hee The curtesie of caused (after the Tartars manner) a Tent and all Cuynetowards ' -\ A r A i t- Ambassadors. . t expenses necessane to bee provided for us. And his people entreated us with more regarde and courtesie, then they did anie other Ambassadours. Howbeeit wee were not called before his presence, because hee was not as yet elected, nor admitted unto his empire. Notwithstanding, the interpretation of the Popes letters, and the message which we delivered, were sent unto him by the foresaid Bathy. And having stayed there five or sixe dayes, hee sent us unto his mother, under whome there was mainteyned a verie solemne and royall court. And being The tent roial come thither, we saw an huge tent of fine white cloth pitched, which was, to our judgement, of so great quantitie, that more then two thousand men might stand within it, and round about it there was a wall of planks set up, painted with divers images. Wee therefore with our A generall Tartars assigned to attende upon us, tooke our journey assemethither, and there were all the Dukes assembled, eche one of them riding up and downe with his traine over the hilles and dales. The first day they were all clad in white, but the second in skarlet robes. Then came Cuyne unto the saide tent. Moreover, the third day they were all in blew robes, and the fourth in most rich robes of Baldakin cloth. In the wall of boardes, about the tent aforesaid, were two great gates, by one of the which gates, the Emperour only was to enter, and at that gate there was no gard of men appointed to stand, although it stood continually open, because none durst go in or come out the same way : all that were admitted, entred by another gate, at which there stood watchmen, with bowes, swords, & arrowes. And whosoever approched unto the tent beyond the bounds and limit assigned, being caught, was beaten, but if he fled, he was shot at with arrowes or iron. There were many that to our judgement, had upon their bridles, trappers, saddles, and such like furniture, to the value of 20. markes in pure gold. The foresaid Dukes (as we thinke) communed together within the tent, and consulted about the election of their Emperor. But all the residue of the people were placed farre away without the walles of they staied almost til noone. board, & in this maner The banquet of Then began they to drink mares milk, & so continued the Nobles. drinking til even tide, and that in so great quantity, as it was wonderfull. And they called us in unto them, and gave us of their ale, because we could not drink their mares milke. And this they did unto us in token of great honor. But they compelled us to drink so much, that in regard of our customary diet, wee coulde by no means endure it. Whereupon, giving them to understand, that it was hurtful unto us, they ceassed to compel [I. 68.] JeroslausDuke us a n y m Ore. Without the doore stoode Duke Jeroslaus ofSusdal. Qf Susdal, in Russia, and a great many Dukes of the Kythayans, and of the Solangi. The two sonnes also of the king of Georgia, the ligier of the Caliph of Baldach, who was a Soldan, and (as we thinke) above ten Soldans Ambassadors of the Saracens beside. And, as it was tolde us by the of sundry na- agents, there were more then 4000. ambassadors, partly of such as paide tributes, and such as presented gifts, and other Soldans, and Dukes, which came to yeeld themselves, and such as the Tartars had sent for, and such as were governours of lands. All these were placed without the lists, and had drinke given unto them. But almost continually they all of them gave us and Duke Jeroslaus the upper hand, when we were abroad in their companie. How he was exalted to his Empire. Chap. 27. ANd to our remembrance, we remained there, about the space of foure weekes. The election was to our Thebeginnings thinking there celebrated, but it was not published and ofCuyne his proclaimed there. And it was greatly suspected so to be, emPtrebecause alwayes when Cuyne came forth out of the tent, he had a noyse of musicke, and was bowed unto, or honoured with faire wands, having purple wooll upon the tops of them, and that, so long as he remained abroad: which service was performed to none of the other Dukes. The foresaid tent or court is called by them Syra Orda. Syra Orda. Departing thence, wee all with one accord rode 3. or 4. leagues unto another place, where, in a goodly plaine, by a rivers side, betweene certaine mountaines, there was another tent erected, which was called the golden Orda. For The golden there was Cuyne to be placed in the throne Emperiall, upon the day of the Assumption of our Ladie. But, for The X5- °f the abundance of haile which fell at the same time, as is ^uSustabove said, the matter was deferred. There was also a tent erected upon pillars, which were covered with plates of golde, and were joyned unto other timber with golden nailes. there was other cloth spread over that, next unto the ayre. Wee abode there unto the feast of Saint Bartholomew, what time there was assembled an huge multitude standing with their faces towards the South. And a certaine number of them beeing a stones cast distant from the residue, making continuall prayers, and kneeling upon their knees, proceeded farther and farther towards the South. Howbeit wee, not knowing whether they used inchantments, or whether they bowed their knees to God or to some other, woulde not kneele upon the grounde with them. And having done so a long time, they returned to the tent, and placed Cuyne in his throne imperiall, and his Dukes bowed their knees before him. Afterwarde the whole multitude kneeled downe in like maner, except our selves, for wee were none of his subjects. It was covered above with Baldakin cloth, but WoUen doth. Of his age and demeanour, and of his seale. Chap. 28. T1 lHis Emperour, when hee was exalted unto his government, seemed to bee about the age of fourty or fourty five yeeres, He was of a meane stature, very wise and politike, and passing serious and grave in all his demeanour. A rare thing it was, for a man to see him laugh or behave himselfe lightly, as those Christians report, which abode continually with him. Certaine Christians of his familie earnestly and strongly affirmed unto us, that he himselfe was about to become a Christian. A token and argument whereof was, that hee reteined inclinaHis tion to Christianitie. d i y e rs Qeargie men of the Christians. Hee had likewise His majestie. doe the like. It is the manner of the Emperour never at all times a Chappell of Christians, neere unto his great Tent, where the Clearkes (like unto other Christians, and according to the custome of the Grecians) doe sing publiquely and openly, and ring belles at certaine houres, bee there never so great a multitude of Tartars, or of other people in presence. And yet none of their Dukes to talke his owne selfe with a stranger, though he be never so great, but heareth and answeareth by a speaker. And when any of his subjects (howe great soever they bee) are in propounding anie matter of importaunce unto him, or in hearing his answeare, they continue kneeling upon their knees unto the ende of their conference. Neither is it lawfull for any man to speake of any affaires, after they have beene determined of by the Emperour. The sayde Emperour, hath in his affaires both publike and private, an Agent, and Secretary of estate, with Scribes and all other Officials, except advocates. For, without the noyse of pleading, or sentence giving, all things are done according to the Emperours will and pleasure. Other Tartarian princes do the like in those things which belong unto them. But, be it known unto al men, that whilest we remained at the said Emperors court, which hath bin ordained and kept for these many yeeres, the 172 A lawlesse , -. those ^ saide Cuyne being Emperor new elect, together with al his princes, erected a flag of defiance against the Church of God, & the Romane empire, and against al Christian Warn /«kingdomes and nations of the West, unlesse peradventure *i Q^tians (which God forbid) they will condescend unto things, which he hath injoined unto our lord the Pope, & to all potentates and people of the Christians, namely, that they wil become obedient unto him. For, except Christendom, there is no land under heaven, which they stand in feare of, and for that cause they prepare themselves to battel against us. This Emperors father, namely Occoday was poisoned to death, which is the cause why they have for a short space absteined from warre. But their intent and purpose is (as I have above said) to subdue the whole world unto themselves, as they were commanded by Chingis Can. Hence it is that the Emperor in his letters writeth after this maner : The power of God, & Emperour of all men. Also, upon his seale, there is this posie ingraven : God in heaven, and Cuyne Can upon earth, the power of God : the seale of the Emperour of all men. Of the admission of the Friers and Ambassadours unto the Emperour. Chap. 29. IN the same place where the Emperour was established Cuyneheareth into his throne, we were summoned before him. And the Legates, Chingay his chiefe secretary having written downe our names, and the names of them that sent us, with the name of the Duke of Solangi, & of others, cried out with a loude voice, rehearsing the said names before the Emperour, and the assembly of his Dukes. Which beeing done, ech one of us bowed his left knee foure times, & they gave us warning not to touch the threshold. And after they had searched us most diligently for knives, and could not find any about us, we entred in at the doore upon the East side : because no man dare presume to enter at the West doore, but the Emperour onely. In like maner, every Tartarian Duke entreth on the West greatly regard such ceremonies. This therefore was the first time, when we entred into the Emperours tent in his presence, after he was created Emperour. Likewise all other ambassadours were there received by him, but very fewe were admitted into his tent. And there were preGifts presen- sented unto him such abundance of gifts by the saide ted unto him. Ambassadours, that they seemed to be infinite, namely in Samites, robes of purple, and of Baldakin cloth, silke girdles wrought with golde, and costly skinnes, with other gifts also. Likewise there was a certaine Sun Canopie, or small tent (which was to bee caried over the Emperours head) presented unto him, being set full of precious stones. And a governour of one Province brought unto him a companie of camels covered with Baldakins. They had saddles also upon their backs, with certaine other instruments, within the which were places for men to sitte upon. Also they brought many horses & mules unto him furnished w* trappers and caparisons, some being leather, and some of iron. And we were made of demanded whether we would bestow any gifts upon him or no ? But wee were not of abilitie so to doe, having in a maner spent all our provision. There were also upon an hill standing a good distance from the tents, 500. Cartsful more then 500. carts, which were all ful of silver and of of treasure. go\^ and silke garments. And they were all divided betweene the Emperour and his Dukes, and every Duke bestowed upon his owne followers what pleased him. A tent of purple. Of the place where the Emperor and his mother tooke their leaves one of another, and of Jeroslaus Duke of Russia. Chap. 30. TP\Eparting thence, we came unto another place, where \^J a wonderfull brave tent, all of red purple, given by the Kythayans, was pitched. Wee were admitted into that also, and alwaies when we entred, there was given unto us ale and wine to drinke, & sodden flesh (when we would) to eate. There was also a loftie stage built of boords, where the Emperours throne was placed, being lvortevery curiously wrought out of ivorie, wherein also there A thrme of was golde and precious stones, and (as we remember) there were certain degrees or staires to ascend unto it. And it was round upon the top. There were benches placed about the saide throne, whereon the ladies sate towarde the left hand of the Emperour upon stooles, (but none sate aloft on the right hande) and the Dukes sate upon benches below, the said throne being in the midst. Certaine others sate behinde the Dukes, and every day there resorted great companie of Ladies thither. The three tents whereof we spake before, were very large, but the Emperour his wives had other great and faire tentes made of white felt. This was the place where the Emperour parted companie with his mother : for she went into one part of the land, and the Emperour into another to execute justice. For there was taken a certaine Concubine of this Emperour, which had poysoned his father to death, at the same time when the Tartars armie was in Hungarie, which, for the same cause returned home. Moreover, upon the foresaide Concubine, and The death of many other of her confederats sentence of judgement was ®ccoda9 re~ pronounced, and they were put to death. At the same time Jeroslaus the great Duke of Soldal, which is a part Or susda/. of Russia, deceased. For being (as it were for honours [I.'70.] sake) invited to eate and drink with the Emperours mother, and immediatly after the banquet, returning unto his lodging, he fel sicke, and within seven dayes, died. And after his death, his body was of a strange blew colour, and it was commonly reported, that the said Duke was poisoned, to the ende that the Tartars might freely and totally possesse his Dukedome. How the Friers comming at length unto the Emperour, gave, and received letters. Chap. 31. T3 be short, the Tartars brought us unto Emperor, who when he had heard of them, that *£ajf* the we were come unto him, commanded that we should ofChingay. A.D. I246. THE ENGLISH VOYAGES return, unto his mother. For he was determined the next day, (as it is abovesaid) to set up a flag of defiance against al ye countreis of the West, which he would have us in no case to know. Wherefore returning, we staied some few dayes with his mother, and so returned backe again unto him. With whom we continued for the space of one whole moneth in such extreme hunger and thirst, that we could scarce hold life and soule together. For the provision allowed us for foure dayes, was scantly sufficient for one day. Neither could we buy us any sustenance, because the market was too farre off. Howbeit the Lorde provided for us a Russian goldsmith, named Cosmas, who being greatly in the Emperours favour, procured us some sustenance. This man shewed unto us the throne of the Emperour, which hee had made, before it was set in the proper place, and his seale, which he also had framed. Afterward the Emperor sent for us, giving us to understand by Chingay his chief Secretary, that wee should write downe our messages & affiiires, and should deliver them unto him. Which thing we performed accordingly. After many daies he called for us againe, demanding whether there were any with our Lord the Pope, which understood the Russian, the Sarracen, or the Tartarian language ? To whom we answered, that we had none of those letters or languages. Howbeit, that there were certaine Saracens in the land, but inhabiting a great distance from our Lord the Pope. And wee saide, that wee thought it most expedient, that when they had written their mindes in the Tartarian language, and had interpreted the meaning therof unto us, we should diligently translate it into our own tongue, and so deliver both the letter and the translation thereof unto our Lord the Pope. Then departed they from us, and went unto the Emperour. And after the day of S. Martine, we were called for againe. Then Kadac principal agent for the whole empire, and Chingay, and Bala, with divers other Scribes, came unto us, and interpreted the letter word for word. And having written it in Latine, they caused us to interprete unto them eche sentence, to wit if we had erred in any word. And when both letters were written, they made us to reade them over twise more, least we should have mistaken ought. For they said unto us : Take heed that ye understand all things throughly, for if you should not understand the whole matter aright, it might breed some inconvenience. They wrote the said letters also in the Saracen tongue, that there might be some found in our dominions which could reade and interprete them, if need should require. How they were licensed to depart. Chap. 32. i i / 1 \i 1 11 tOj nave any christtansANd (as our Tartars told us) the Emperour was pur- The Legates posed to send his ambassadors with us. Howbeit, a[e i i* Atnhe was desirous (as we thought) that we our selves should bassadours crave that favour at his hands. And when one of our sent from the Tartars being an ancient man, exhorted us to make the said Tartars to the petition, we thought it not good for us, that the Emperor should send his ambassadours. Wherfore we gave him answere, that it was not for us to make any such petition, but if it pleased the Emperour of his owne accord to send them, we would diligently (by Gods assistance) see them conducted in safetie. Howbeit, we thought it expedient for us, that they should not goe, and that for divers causes. First, because we feared, least they, seeing the dissentions and warres which are among us, should be the more encouraged to make warre against us. Secondly, we feared, that they would be insteade of spies and intelligencers in our dominions. Thirdly, we misdoubted that they would be slaine by the way. For our nations be arrogant and proud. For when as those servants (which at the request of the Cardinall, attended upon us, namely the legates of Almaine) returned unto him in the Tartars attire, they were almost stoned in the way, by the Dutch, and were compelled to put off those garments. And it is the Tartars custome, never to bee reconciled unto such as have slaine their Ambassadours, till they have revenged themselves. Fourthly, least they should bee taken from us 177 1 November 13. They are rewarded with gifts. The sore journeys of the Le- gates in returning. Bathy. Corrensa. THE ENGLISH VOYAGES by mayne force. Fiftly, because there could come no good by their ambassade, for they were to have none other commission, or authoritie, but onely to deliver their Emperours letter unto the Pope, and to the Princes of Christendome, which very same letters wee our selves had, and we knew right well, that much harme might ensue thereof. Wherefore, the third day after this, namely, upon the feast of Saint Brice, they gave us our passe-port and a Letter sealed with the Emperours owne seale, sending us unto the Emperours mother, who gave unto eche of us a gowne made of Foxe-skinnes, with the furre on the outside, and a piece of purple. And our Tartars stole a yarde out of every one of them. And out of that which was given unto our servant, they stole the better halfe. Which false dealing of theirs, we knew well inough, but would make no words thereof. H ow they returned homewards. Chap. 33. field. And oftentimes THen taking our journey to returne, we travailed all Winter long, lying in the deserts oftentimes upon the snow, except with our feete wee made a piece of ground bare to lye upon. For there were no trees, but in the the plaine champion morning, we found our selves all covered with snow driven over us by the winde. And so travailing till the feast of our Lordes Ascension, we arrived at the court of Bathy. Of whom when wee had enquired, what answere he would send unto our Lord the Pope, he said that he had nothing to give us in charge, but onely that we should diligently deliver that which the Emperour had written. And, having received letters for our safe conduct, the thirteenth day after Pentecost, being Saterday, wee were proceeded as farre as Montii, with whome our foresaide associates and servants remained, which were withheld from us, and we caused them to be delivered unto us. From hence wee travailed unto Corrensa, to whom, requiring gifts the second time at our hands, we gave none, because we had not wherewithall. And hee appointed us two Comanians, which lived among the common people of the Tartars, to be our guides unto the citie of Kiow in Russia. Howbeit one of our Tartars parted not from us, till we were past the utmost gard of the Tartars. But the other guides, namely the Comanians, which were given us by Corrensa, brought us from the last garde unto the citie of Kiow, in the space of sixe dayes. And there we arrived fifteene dayes before the feast of Saint John June 8. Baptist. Moreover, the Citizens of Kiow having intelli- How the] gence or our approch, came foorth all of them to meete com^ at us, with great joy. For they rejoyced over us, as over their retume. men that had bene risen from death to life. So like wise they did unto us throughout all Russia, Polonia, and Bohemia. Daniel and his brother Wasilico made us a Basilius and royall feast, and interteined us with them against our ®ael willes for the space of eight dayes. In the meane time, they with their Bishops, and other men of account, being in consultation together about those matters which we had propounded unto them in our journey towards the Tartars, answered us with common consent, saying : that they would holde the Pope for their speciall Lord and Father, and the Church of Rome for their Lady & mistresse, confirming likewise al things which they had sent concerning this matter, before our comming, by their Abbate. And for the same purpose, they sent their Ambassadours and letters by us also, unto our Lord the Pope.
