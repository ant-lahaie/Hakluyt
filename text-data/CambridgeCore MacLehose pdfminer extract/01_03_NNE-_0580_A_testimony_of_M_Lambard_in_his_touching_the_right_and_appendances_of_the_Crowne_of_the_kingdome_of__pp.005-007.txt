testimonie of the crowne of taken out of M. Lambard his MpKmovoixla, fol. 137. pag. 2. the right and appendances of the kingdome of Britaine, ARthurus qui fuit quondam inclytissimus Rex Britonum, vir magnus fuit & animosus, & miles illustris. Parum fuit ei regnum istud, non fuit animus ejus contentus regno Britanniae. Subjugavit igitur sibi strenue Scantiam totam, quae modo Norweia vocatur, & omnes insulas ultra Scantiam, scz. Islandiam, & Grenlandiam, quae sunt de appendiciis Norweiae, & Suechordam, & Hyberniam, & Gutlandiam, & Daciam, Semelandiam, Winlandiam, Curlandiam, Roe, Femelandiam, Wirelandiam, Flandriam, Cherelam, Lappam, & omnes alias terras & insulas, Orientalis Oceani usque Russiam (in Lappa scilicet posuit Orientalem metam regni Britanniae) & multas insulas ultra Scantiam, usque dum sub Septentrione, quae sunt de appendicibus Scantiae, quae modo Norweia vocatur. Fuerunt autem ibi Christiani occulte. Arthurus autem Christianus optimus fuit, & fecit eos baptizari, & unum Deum per totam Norweiam venerari, & unam fidem Christi semper inviolatam custodire, & suscipere. Ceperunt universi proceres Norweiae uxores suas de nobili gente Britonum tempore illo, unde Norwegienses dicunt se exiisse de gente & sanguine regni Impetravit enim temporibus illis Arthurus rex hujus. a domino Papa, & a Curia Romana, quod confirmata sit Norweia, in perpetuum coronae Britanniae in augmentum regni hujus, vocavitque illam dictus Arthurus Cameram Britannias. Hac vero de causa dicunt Norwegienses, se debere in regno isto cohabitare & dicunt se esse de corpore regni hujus, scilicet de corona Britanniae. Maluerunt enim manere in regno isto, quam in terra eorum propria. Terra enim eorum arida est, & montuosa, & sterilis, & non sunt ibi segetes nisi per loca. Ista vero opulenta est, & fertilis, & crescunt hie segetes, & caetera universa. Qua ex causa saepius per vices gesta sunt bella sunt innumerabiles. Occupaverunt vero Norwegienses terras multas & insulas regni hujus, quas adhuc detinent occupatas, nee potuerunt unquam postea penitus evelli. Tandem modo confederati sunt nobis fide, & sacramento, & per uxores suas, quas postea ceperunt de sanguine nostro, & per affinitates, & conjugia. Ita demum constituit, & eis concessit bonus rex Edouardus propinquus noster (qui fuit optimus filius pacis) per commune consilium totius regni. Qua de causa possent, & debent praedicti de caetero nobiscum cohabitare, & remanere in regno, sicut conjurati fratres nostri. The same in English. ARthur which was sometimes the most renowmed king of the Britains, was a mightie, and valiant man, and a famous warriour. This kingdome was too litle for him, & his minde was not contented with it. He therefore valiantly subdued all Scantia, which is now called Norway, and all the Islands beyond Norway, to wit, Island and Greenland, which are apperteining unto Norway, Sweveland, Ireland, Gotland, Denmarke, Semeland, Windland, Curland, Roe, Femeland, Wireland, Flanders, Cherilland, Lapland, and all the other lands & Islands of the East sea, even unto Russia (in which Lapland he placed the Easterly bounds of his Brittish Empire) and many other Islands beyond Norway, even under the North pole, which are appendances of Scantia, now called Norway. These people were wild and savage, and had not in them the love of God nor of their neighbors, because all evill commeth from the North, yet there were among them certeine Christians living in secret. But king Arthur was an exceeding good Christian, and caused them to be baptized, and thorowout all Norway to worship one God, and to receive and keepe inviolably for ever, faith in Christ onely. At that time all the noble men of Norway tooke wives of the noble nation of the Britaines, race and blood of this kingdome. The aforesayd king Arthur obteined also in those dayes of the Pope & court of Rome, that Norway should be for ever annexed to the crowne of Britaine for the inlargement of this kingdome, and he called it the chamber of Britaine. For this cause the Norses say, that they ought to dwell with us in this kingdome, to wit, that they belong to the crowne of Britaine : for they had rather dwell here then in their owne native countrey, which is drieand full of mountaines, [I. 3.] and barren, and no graine growing there, but in certeine places. But this countrey of Britaine is fruitfull, wherein corne and all other good things do grow and increase : for which cause many cruell battels have bene oftentimes fought betwixt the Englishmen and the people of Norway, and infinite numbers of people have bene slaine, & the Norses have possessed many lands and Islands of this Empire, which unto this day they doe possesse, neither could they ever afterwards be fully expelled. But now at length they are incorporated with us by the receiving of our religion and sacraments, and by taking wives of our nation, and by affinitie, and mariages. For so the good king Edward (who was a notable mainteiner of peace) ordeined and granted unto them by the generall consent of the whole kingdome, so that the people may, and ought from hencefoorth dwell and remaine in this kingdome with us as our loving sworne brethren. A testimonie out of the foresayd Galfridus Monumetensis, concerning the conquests of Malgo, king of England. Lib. 11. cap. 7. JiOrtiporio successit Malgo, omnium fere Britanniae pulcherrimus, multorum tyrannorum depulsor, Irobustus armis, largior caeteris, & ultra modum probitate praeclarus. Hie etiam totam Insulam obtinuit, & sex conprovinciales Oceani Insulas : Hyberniam videlicet, atque Islandiam, Gotlandiam, Orcades, Noruegiam, Daciam, adjecit dirissimis praeliis potestati suae.
