Augustissime & invictissime Caesar, accepimus invictissimae Caesareae vestrae celsitudinis literas, die decimoquinto Martii currentis anni ad nos scriptas Constantinopoli, ex quibus intelligimus quam benigne quamque clementer, literae supplices quae Caesareae vestrae celsitudini a quodam subdito nostro Guilielmo Hareborno in Imperiali Celsitudinis vestrae civitate Constantinopoli commorante offerebantur, literae profectionis pro se & sociis ejus duobus hominibus mercatoribus subditis nostris cum mercibus suis ad terras ditionesque Imperio vestro subjectas tarn per mare quam per terras, indeque reversionis veniae potestatisque humillimam complexae petitionem, ab invictissima vestra Caesarea celsitudine, acceptae fuerunt. Neque id solum, sed quam mira cum facilitate, dignaque augustissima Caesarea dementia, quod erat in dictis literis supplicibus positum, ei sociisque suis donatum & concessum fuit, pro ea, uti videtur, soHim opinione, quam de nobis, & nostra amicitia vestra celsitudo concepit. Quod singulare beneficium in dictos subditos nostros collatum tarn grate tamque benevole accepimus (maximas celsitudini vestrae propterea & agentes, & habentes gratias) nullo ut unquam patiemur tempore, pro facultatum nostrarum ratione, proque ea quam nobis insevit ter maximus mundi monarcha Deus (per quern & cujus auspiciis regnamus) naturae bonitate, qua remotissimas nos esse voluit, & abhorrentes ab ingratitudinis omni vel minima suspitione, docuitque nullorum unquam ut principum, ullis in nos meritis nos sineremus vinci, aut superari, ut apud ingratam principem tantum beneficium deposuisse, se vestra Celsitudo existimet. Proptereaque animum nostrum inprsesentiarum vestrae celsitudini emetimur, benb sentiendo & praedicando, quantopere nos obstrictas beneficii hujus in subditos nostros collati putemus memorii sempiterni : longe uberiorem, & ampliorem gratitudinis erga vestram celsitudinem nostrae testificationem daturae, cum tempora incident, ut possimus & a nobis desiderabitur. Quoniam autem quae nostris paucis subditis, eaque suis ipsorum precibus, sine ulla intercessione nostra concessa donatio est, in aeque libera potestate sita est ad omnes terras ditionesque Imperio vestro subjeetas, cum mercibus suis tarn per mare qu&m per terras eundi & redeundi, atque invictissimae Caesareae vestrae celsitudinis confoederatis, Gallis, Polonis, Venetis, atque adeo regis Romanorum subditis largita unquam aut donata fuit, celsitudinem [II. i. 139.] vestram rogamus ne tarn singularis beneficentiae laus in tarn angustis terminis duorum aut trium hominum concludatur, sed ad universos subditos nostros diffusa, propagataque, celsitudinis vestrae beneficium eo reddat augustius, quo ejusdem donatio latius patebit, & ad plures pertinebit. Cujus tarn singularis in nos beneficii meritum, e6 erit celsitudini vestrae minus poenitendum, quo sunt merces illae, quibus regna nostra abundant, tarn humanis & aliorum principum ditiones egent, tamque necessariae, nulla gens ut usibus commodae sit, quae eis carere queat, proptereaque longissimis, difficillimisque itineribus conquisitis non vehementer gaudeat. Carifts autem distrahunt aliis, quo ex labore suo quisque victum & quaestum quaeritat, adeo ut in earum acquisitione utilitas, in emptione autem ab aliis onus sit. Utilitas celsitudinis vestrae subditis augebitur libenl hac paucorum nostrorum hominum ad terras vestras profectione : onus minuetur, profectionis quorum- cunque subditorum nostrorum donatione. Accedet praeterea quae a nobis in celsitudinis vestrae subditos proficiscetur, par, aequaque mercium exercendarum libertas, quoties & quando voluerint ad regna dominiaque nostra mercaturae gratia accedere. Quam celsitudini vestrae pollicemur tarn amplam lateque patentem fore, quam est ulla a confoederatorum vestrorum ullis principibus antedictis, regibus videlicet Romanorum, Gallorum, Polonorum, ac republica Veneta, celsitudinis vestrae subditis ullo unquam tempore concessa & donata. Qua ab ea contendimus & rogamus, ea proposita praestitaque securitate, quae subditos nostros quoscunque ad dominia sua, terra, marique proficiscentes, indeque revertentes tutos & securos reddat ab omni quorumcunque subditorum suorum injuria, efficiemus, ut quse Deus opt. max. in regna dominiaque nostra contulit commoda (quae tarn singularia sunt, omnium ut principum animos pelliceant ad amicitiam, summaeque necessitudinis conjunctionem nobiscum contrahendam, stabiliendamque quo liberius tantis summi Dei beneficiis fruantur, quibus carere nequeunt) nostri subditi ad regna dominiaque Celsitudinis tamque cumulate, ut vestrae advehant tarn affluenter utrique incommodo praedicto necessitatis & oneris plenissime succurratur. Facit praeterea singularis ista Celsi- tudinis vestrae in nos Gentemque nostram summae benevolentiae significatio ac fides, ut eandem, in causam quorundam subditorum nostrorum, qui captivi triremibus vestris detinentur, interpellemus, rogemusque, ut quoniam nullo in celsitudinem vestram peccato suo, sive arma in earn ferendo, sive iniquius praeter fas & jus gentium se gerendo in suos subditos, in hanc calamitatem inciderint, soluti vinculis, & libertate donati, nobis pro sua fide & obsequio inservientes, causam uberiorem praebeant vestrae Celsitudinis in nos humanitatem praedicandi : & Deum ilium, qui solus, & supra omnia & omnes est acerrimus idololatriae vindicator, suique honoris contra Gentum & aliorum falsos Deos Zelotes, praecabimur, ut vestram invictissimam Caesaream Celsitudinem omni beatitate eorum donorum fortunet, quae sola & summi jure merito habentur desideratissima.

Most Imperiall and most invincible Emperour, wee have received the letters of your mightie highnesse written to us from Constantinople the fifteenth day of March this present yere, whereby we understand how gratiously, and how favorably the humble petitions of one William Hareborne a subject of ours, resident in the Imperial citie of your highnes presented unto your Majestie for the obteining of accesse for him and two other Marchants more of his company our subjects also, to come with marchandizes both by sea and land, to the countreis and territories subject to your government, and from thence againe to returne home with good leave and libertie, were accepted of your most invincible Imperiall highnesse, and not that onely, but with an extraordinarie speed and worthy your Imperiall grace, that which was craved by petition was granted to him, and his company in regard onely (as it seemeth) of that opinion which your highnesse conceived of us and our amitie : which singular benefit done to our aforesaid subjects, wee take so thankefully, and in so good part (yeelding for the same our greatest thanks to your highnesse) that we will pi. i. 140.] never give occasion to your said highnesse (according as time, and the respect of our aiFaires will permit) once to thinke so great a pleasure bestowed upon an ungratefull grace we reigne, hath planted in us this goodnesse of nature, that wee detest and abhorre the least suspition of ingratitude, and hath taught us not to suffer our selves to bee overmatched with the good demerits of other Princes. And therefore at this time wee doe extende our good minde unto your highnesse, by well conceiving, and publishing also abroad, how much we repute our selfe bound in an everlasting remembrance for this good pleasure to our Subjects, meaning to yeelde a much more large and plentiful! testification of our thankefulnesse, when time convenient shall fall out, and the same shall bee looked for at our handes. that But whereas that graunt which was given to a fewe of our Subjects, and at their onely request without any intercession of ours, standeth in as free a libertie of comming and going to and from all the lands and kingdoms subject to your Majestie, both by land & sea with marchandizes, as ever was granted to any of your Imperiall highnesse confederates, as namely to the French, the Polonians, the Venetians, as also to the subjects of the king of the Romanes, wee desire of your highnesse the commendation of such singular courtesie may not bee so narrowly restrained to two or three men onely, but may be inlarged to all our subjects in generall, that thereby your highnesse goodnesse may appeare the more notable, by reason of the graunting of the same to a greater number of persons. The bestowing of which so singular a benefit your highnesse shall so much the lesse repent you of, by howe much the more fit and necessary for the use of man those commodities the are, wherewith our kingdomes doe abound, and kingdomes of other princes doe want, so yl there is no nation that can be without them, but are glad to come by them, although by very long and difficult travels : and when they have them, they sell them much deerer to others, because every man seeketh to make profite by his labour : so that tin the getting of them there is profit, but in the buying of them from others there is losse. highnesse by this free accesse of a few of our subjects to your dominions, as also the losse and burden wilbe eased, by the permission of generall accesse to all our people. And furthermore we will graunt as equall and as free a libertie to the subjects of your highnesse with us for the use of traffique, when they wil, and as often as they wil, to come, and go to and from us and our kingdomes. Which libertie wee promise to your highnesse shalbe as ample, and as large as any was ever given or granted to your subjects by the aforesaide princes your confederats, as namely the king of the Romanes, of France, of Poland, and the common wealth of Venice. In which matter, if your most invincible Imperiall highnesse shall vouchsafe to incline to our reasonable request, and shall give order upon these our letters, that wee may have knowledge how the same is accepted of you, and whether it wilbe granted, with sufficient securitie for our subjects to go, and returne safe and secure from all violences and injuries of your people, we on the other side wil give order, those commodities which Almighty God hath bestowed upon our kingdomes (which are in deed so excellent, that by reason of them all princes are drawen to enter, and confirme leagues of amitie and good neighborhood with us, by that meanes to enjoy these so great blessings of God, which we have, and they can in no case want) our subjects shall bring them so abundantly and plentifully to the kingdomes and dominions of your highnesse, that both the former inconveniences of necessitie, and losse, shall most sufficiently be taken away. that Moreover the signification and assurance of your highnesse great affection to us and our nation, doeth cause us also to intreat and use mediation on the behalfe of certaine of our subjects, who are deteined as slaves and captives in your Gallies, for whom we crave, that forasmuch as they are fallen into that misery, not by any offence of theirs, by bearing of armes against your high177 v nesse, or in behaving of themselves contrary to honestie, and to the law of nations, they may be delivered from their bondage, and restored to libertie, for their service towardes us, according to their duetie: which thing shall yeeld much more abundant cause to us of commending your clemencie, and of beseeching that God (who onely is above all things, and all men, and is a most severe revenger of all idolatrie, and is jelous of his honour against the false gods of the nations) to adorne your most invincible Imperiall highnesse with all those gifts, which onely and deservedly are accounted most worthy of asking. the blessings of Given at our palace of Greenwich, neere to our Citie of London, the five and twentieth day of October, in the yeere of Jesus Christ our Saviour one thousand, five hundreth, seventie and nine, and of our reigne the one and twentieth.
