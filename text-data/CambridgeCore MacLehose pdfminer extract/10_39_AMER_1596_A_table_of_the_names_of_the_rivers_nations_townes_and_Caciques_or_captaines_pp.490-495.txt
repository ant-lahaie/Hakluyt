In one worde; The time serveth, the like occasion seldome happeneth in many ages, the former repeated considerations doe all joyntly together importune us, nowe, or never to make our selves rich, our posteritie happie, our Prince every way stronger then our enemies, and to establish our Countrey in a state flourishing and peaceable.

In this bay, & round about, so far as the mountaines do extend there is great store of Brasill wood, some of it bearing farre darker colour then other some. Here are also many sortes of other good woods. 14 These speake the language of the Indians of Dominica. They are but few, but very cruel to their enemies. For they bind, and eat them alive peecemeale. This torment is not comparable to the deadly paine that commeth of hurts, or woundes, made by those arrowes that are invenomed with the juice of ye herbe Wapototo. These Indians because they eate them whome they kill, use no poyson. The sea coast is nowhere populous, for they have much wasted themselves, in mutuall warres. But now in all parts so farre as Orenoque, they live in league and peace. 21. Neere the head of this river, Capeleppo falleth out of the plaines, and runneth into the Sea with Curitini.

They get their Moones, & other pieces of gold by exchange, taking for each one of their greater Canoas, one piece or image of golde, with three heades, and after that rate for their lesser Canoas, they receive pieces of golde of lesse value. One hatchet is the ordinarie price for a Canoa. They have every where divers sorts of drugs, gummes, and rootes, which I doubt not by farther trial, will be found medicinable.
