From hence toward the point called Punta de Intla and Dordaci there is a Bay 2. leagues distant, which though it be no special harbour, yet upon an extremity ships may come and ride there, as in times past they have done. This Bay on the right hand toward the North maketh a lake somewhat large towards the midst of the chanell, and in some parts deepe, but specially on the side of Cuahintla, but on either side it is but shallow. As you passe betweene the sea & certaine great and large woods of orenge trees, and trees of other nature which grow along the sea coast, which are of no great bredth, al the countrey appeareth very open: howbeit on the side of Cuahintla the mountaines have many creeks and a small lake called Tulaningo, and the countrey cannot be travelled, except you take the way betweene the sea and the end of this lake, which may be about two leagues of sandy way. 466 The Port of Tecuanapa.

These inconveniences being past (which in my judgement may be about one league) the river is more navigable, so that you may sayle in the same about 12. leagues. During the space of which 12. leagues, about a league and a halfe distance from the waters side, and in many other parts of the same river it hath great quantitie of woods which use to grow in hot soiles, fit for shiptimber, as Huber-trees, & Suchicuhitil, whereof they of Nicaragua make great profit. Also there be white Nicaragua. okes and Tehegurtes in great quantitie, and many other kinds of timber: and in the mountaines there be firretrees, okes, and cork-trees, which easily may bee they may be cut caried downe some 2, 3, 4, and 5. leagues from the river, and may be brought downe to the waters side with the service and helpe of those that dwell in the townes thereabout. the river, because At the head of these brooks where the river beginneth is the towne which is called Xicaian, belonging to the Xkaian, heires of Francis de Touer y de Guillen, containing about 350.

These are the best townes, and of the best traffique that are upon all this coast. The Indians are rich in Cacao and victuals, and in these townes doe the Indians of Niciecan principally trade. And in the towne of Ihualapa the chiefe Alguazil of the province is resident for the most part of the yeere. Ometepec. Ihualapa. Niciecan.

Ometepec is the towne called Pio, which was wont to be the towne of ancient inhabitants: one Graviel de Chiavez a citizen of Mexico hath the governement thereof: it is 4. leagues from Ihualapa, and 6. from the sea. A little below this is the towne of Huehuatlan in the Huehuatkn. selfe same governement standing one league from the river on certaine high hils : it hath 10. Indians, and is from the sea 5. leagues.

At the fountaines or heads of the rest of the brooks is the towne of Cacatepec being in the government of Cacatepec Raphael de Treyo: he and his tenants have under them some 700. Indians of Niciecan: it is from the sea some 22. leagues. The river which is called Tlacamama commeth from The river of the mountains of Atoyaque and Amusgos, which are Tlacamamasome 17. leagues from the sea. There it maketh a formed river, so big, that it is navigable to the sea with canoas and lighters: I say from a litle below Tolistlahuaca a mansion of Xicaian. It is navigable 8. moneths in the yeere, and the other 4. not, because that the sands of the plaines do soke and drink up the water in such wise, that there remaineth so little, that there is no passage: howbeit in small lighters timber may bee brought downe this river one league from the place where it is cut, unto the place that I have spoken of; whereas bigger vessels may bee made; for nigh unto that place other brooks and running waters doe joyne and meet, which make it a maine river. It hath nigh unto it in the mountaines of Atoyaque, Cacatepec, and Amusgos many woods of pine-trees, cork-trees, and okes of great bignesse: and beneath those mountaines in the warme countrey, neere unto the rivers there is much and carried downe unto Tecuanapa in the time before specified. This river hath likewise townes adjoyning to it; the first at the foote of the mountaines is the town of Atoiaque belonging to the king, & to the heires of Pronetto: their language is Niciecan, the countrey hot, the people politique, & it is from the sea 15. leagues. It hath about 200. Indians. One league from this towne, and 14. from the sea is the towne of Xicaian belonging likewise to the king, and to the heires of Pronetto. They are Niciecan people It hath by and very comely, and in a hot countrey. the in it account 300. Indians. There are resident Vicar and Justice; it is from the river a league and a halfe.

More toward the South 5. leagues from the river, and two from this towne, and 14. from the sea is the towne called Pinotespan del Rey: They are handsome people, but of slow speach: this towne conteineth about 100.

Neere upon this river are two farmes, the one belonging to Pedro Bravo, and the other to him that maketh this relation unto your Excellencie, which may be from the sea some 8. or 9. leagues all plaine ground. And in this territorie there is but one towne called Quesala Quesala. situate upon the sea; which in times past hath beene a great towne, and nowe hath but three Indians onely, and it is from the farmes 3. leagues. the river, and 6. leagues from The mansion house of Don Mattheo is more toward the South, standing in a large mountainous and waste countrey, which aboundeth with cattell being 3. leagues from the river; and as farre from Tecuanapa, as from the place where all the cattell is; and the sea that way is from it but one league. A little below this mansion about 4. leagues, and 7. leagues from the sea, is a garden of Alonso Pedraza which beareth Cacao. And 2. leagues from this garden and 6. leagues from the sea standeth the towne of Cuahintlan belonging to the Cuahintlan king, a towne of 19 housholds, but very rich, for they del Rey. gather much Cacao and the best in that countrey.

Hard by it is the towne of Tlacolula abovenamed; and Azoyoque. 3. leagues from it is the towne of Azoyoque an olde manour of Tlapa. The towne of Chilsiztlahuaca hath but 3.

For they may, as I have sayd, carrie the timber in lighters or rafts downe the rivers, and may use the Indians in the townes thereabout to fell, and draw the same out of the cold mountaines; for in the warm countreyes the most is plaine ground, whereas with very fewe men and oxen it may be brought unto the place where it should be imbarqued. There may come flat bottomes, and canoas unto the townes thereabout, and lade themselves with victuals: For they have already come by that river to the rode of Ometepec, & made there provision at the mansion of Don Mattheo, and at the farmes, at that time when his Majestie did people the plaines which are betweene these rivers, conteining a large and voyde countrey sufficient for the erecting of 20. manours, being a countrey well furnished with water and pasture without any danger or perill, according to the description hereunto annexed. This small harbour of Tecuanapa being seene and viewed, seemeth very commodious for to build shippes rivers, and with the service and victuals from the townes £2ld ships for thereabout, which be very good for coast townes. the South sea.
