horse drowned, although other rivers do remaine frozen a long time after. In the towne of Some also there are many warehouses, whereof we cannot be destitute for the reposing of our wares, as also as many barkes as you wil to transport your wares from thence to S. Nicholas road, and that for three pence a poods caryage : so that from the Citie of Novogrod unto S. Nicholas road you may have wares caried for two altines. The pood commeth unto 23. altines the tunne. Provided alwayes, that you buy your wares there your Novogrod selfe, and send it thence : for there is no hope that the wifinJ* natives will bring their wares from Novogrod to Some, in hope to sell unto us, considering the great trade that they have at the Narve, which is within 180 miles off them.
