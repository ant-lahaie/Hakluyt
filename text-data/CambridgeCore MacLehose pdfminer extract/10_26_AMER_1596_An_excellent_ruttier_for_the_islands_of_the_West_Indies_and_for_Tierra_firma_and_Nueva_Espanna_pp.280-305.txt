The marks to know it bee a certaine high land full of hilles. And seeing it when thou art farre off to the seaward, it maketh in the middest a partition; so that a man would thinke it devided the Island in two parts. And this Island standeth in 14 degrees and a halfe. I advise thee that if thou wouldest goe for Nueva Espanna, and so doest passe betweene Guadalupe and Monserate to the Westward, that being thus open off the entrance betwixt them thou shalt go Westnorthwest, know it be these.

Thou must marke that Cape de Cruz maketh an ende of the coast that commeth from the East to the West, and beginneth the course that goeth North and South, and standeth in 19. degrees, rather more then lesse. From Cape de Cruz thou must stirre Westnorthwest: and this way thou shalt have sight of the Isle de Pinos, and if thou have faire weather, then thou must goe Northwest, and by West, because of the currents that will set thee out to sea. And keeping this course thou I tell thee it is the shalt have sight of an high land. called the land of Zagueio: and then thou shalt goe West and by South: and if it bee by night, then goe Westsouthwest untill thou have brought thy selfe out from The Jardines.

And thou must also take good heed that thou have sight on the same coast of a white sandie Bay; and it is on the same coast that lyeth Northwest and Southeast. And these be the markes from Punta de las Arenas, or The poynt of the sands, to the Cape of Saint Anthonie, and from the Cape de Corrientes to Punta de las Arenas thou shalt have a great Bay, being so long, that if thou be not very neere the shore thou canst not see land, it is so low. And if thou see not the land well, it will shew to be a tuft of trees. And the Cape of S. Anthony standeth in 22. degrees. I Advise thee that going from Martinino or Dominica, if thou wouldest goe for Margarita, that thou stirre South and by West, because of the great currents that goe here, and set Northwest. And by this course thou shalt find the Testigos, which be 4 or 5 Islands: and The Testigos. if thou wilt not goe so much to windward, then thou shalt see Frailes, which bee three small Islands. And Frai/es. if thou wilt goe into the harbour of Manpater, it is presently in doubling of the point on the East side to the Southward.

A man may be bold to go betwixt this rocke and the maine. And going from this Cape to have sight of Cape del Aguja thou must stirre Southwest, and thou shalt have sight of the Ancones which lye at the ende of the hilles called Sierras Nevadas. And then presently thou shalt see the Cape del Aguja: the marks whereof are these: It is a low Cape, and upon it is a copple not very high, and there beginneth the high land of the Sierras Nevadas, or snowy mountaines. Take this for a warning that if thou goe for Cape de la Vela by night by the course abovesayd, and commest into a whitish water, then sound and thou shalt find 40. fathoms, and thy sound will be certaine smal sandy white oaze, and some smal weeds. And then thou mayest make account thou art North and that South with the river called Rio de Palominos, which commeth out of the midst of the Sierras Nevadas. And being benighted thou shalt go Westnorthwest, or West and by North until day: and being day then thou mayest hale in with sight of the land Southwest, because thou mayest be sure to come right in with it. If thou goe from Cape del Aguja for Cartagena, if it bee by day, thou shalt goe West and by South, and shalt goe to have sight of Morro Hermoso, that is The faire mountaine, which lyeth to the Westward of Rio grande. And being alone, and with a good ship of saile, and drawing towards night, then thou must come to anker behind Morro hermoso: and after the first watch thou must set saile, and go out West and by North, because thou must be sure to keep a seaboord from the Island de Arenas, which lyeth 2 leagues to seaward right against Samba. And if thou goe from Cape del Aguja by night, thou shalt goe West and by North : and so thou shalt goe without the force of the water of Rio Grande. And West of Rio Grande, and hath for markes, a face of a blacke land not very hie, and it is round. And if thou depart by day from Morro hermoso, thou must goe West, and must take heede,as I sayde before, of the Isle de Arenas, which lyeth North and South of Samba. Samba hath for a marke as it were a gallie towed.

And the Bay that goeth to Cartagena beginneth here, Cartagena. and lyeth Northeast and Southwest. And take this for a warning, that if thou be benighted against Samba, thou shalt take in thy sailes, & lye off to the offward until midnight without any saile abroad until midnight: and from midnight forward thou shalt lye so into the land without sayle : and if in the breake of day thou see no land, then goe Southwest, and if this way thou have sight of certaine white cliffes, make account it is Buio del Gato. Take this for a warning, if thy ship bee great come not nigh the land in the Bay: I meane thou mayest not with a great ship come nigh the land from the poynt de la Canoa untill thou come to Cartagena, because in many places there are not above 3 or 4 fathoms at the most. In all this Bay there is no hie land but the Gallie, which is right over the harbour of Cartagena. land And if it chance that any man come for this place that The land never was here before, then let him looke for a little marks °f hill like a towed gallie lying East and West, and all CartaZenathe trees.

And when thou findest thy selfe in deepe water, as in 30 fathoms and more, then the harbour will bee open before thee. And if thou have any fresh Northerne winds, then loofe up to the seaward, and lye with thy stemme Eastsoutheast, and so the thou mayest goe in East middest of the chanell: and though it bee by night, yet thou mayest goe in safely, because it is all cleere. And if the night be cleere thou shalt have sight of the Island called Cares, and it is an high land. through Comming from Cartagena to goe for Nombre de Dios in the time of the Northerne winds, thou must bring thy selfe to the offward of Sal medina : and thence stirre West till thou bring thy selfe North and South with Cabeza de Cativa; and then goe Southwest and by West, and thou shalt so fall with Rio de Francisco. It hath for markes a certaine land not very high, and within the land certaine high hils lying East and West. And on the West of the river of Francisco thou shalt see certaine cliffes that bee sixe leagues from Nombre de Dios, inclining toward the sea. I advise thee that going this course above written ; if thou see 3 or 4 Isles lying lowe with the sea, and also lying East and West, thou mayest make account that they be the Islands de Cativa, and then runne West, and so thou shalt go along the coast. And if thou see by this way a poynt of low land, make account it is Punta de Samblas : and upon it thou shalt see a row of hie rockie hils, and they be the mountaines of Santa Cruz.

I advise thee, that if thou come for Cartagena in the the wind will not suffer going thus if thou seest a great high Island full of mountaines, and on the North side thereof thou see a ledge of rocks two leagues into the sea, thou mayest be dgeof k Islafuerte. sure it is Isla fuerte : but if thou see not the rocks, Ale give them a good breadth: and if thou wilt come to anker, thou mayest ride well on the West side of them, betwixt the maine and them in fifteene fathomes; and the sounding is clay.

And if any man aske thee how thou knowest the Islands of Baru and San Barnardo, thou mayest answere truely, that the Isles of San Barnardo are full of high hilles, and certaine sandie bayes to seaward ; and the sayd Isles have a good depth two or three leagues La Badlla. to the sea : and this depth is called the Barilla. And these are all the markes for the Islandes of San Barnardo. And touching the Isles of Baru, they bee 3 or 4 little Islands and very even with the sea, and full of trees, and there is no good depth about them, but hard aboord them. A ruttier from Cartagena to Havana in Cuba.

I advise thee that if thou canst not passe on the West side, then thou must goe betwixt the sayd little copple that it is like a sayle and the shoald: for the passage is good. But if thou depart from the Serranilla to the Northwest, and seest a lowe land with the sea, and certaine white sandy bayes, and on the West side seest a low land, and on the Eastside a little coast lying East and West, thou mayest make account it is Cape Cape de Corrientes. de Corrientes.

And to be short, we went here on land in the same place that we first fell with in the evening before: and it was an Island called Cozumel, lying on the coast of Yucatan. And this Island was the land which we saw first, seeming by the marks to be the Cape de Corrientes.

I advise thee, that if it be by night, thou goe East; and finding the water to waxe shoalder, then goe Southwest, with a care to keepe thy lead going, untill thou loose ground, and come into great depth, because thou mayest fall to the North of the Tortugas. And going from this sound for Havana thou must stirre Southsoutheast, because of the currents that carrie The currents thee to the East.

And if the wind will not let thee go that course, thou must turne up till thou be upon the harbour of Havana. The marks of the poynt of Havana be these, that on the East side it hath an hie blacke land, which is sloping and as thou goest into the port, thou must keepe neere the high blacke land, and when thou art hard to it* strike thy toppe sayles in signe of peace to the castle, least it shoote at thee.

And the coast lieth East and West. The marks be these, it sheweth like heads of trees, and in some places certaine rocks with white sandy bayes. And if the wind be large, thou mayest go East and by South untill thou see the coast to lye Northeast and Southwest: and if the wind be scant, then go turning u p: and take good heed that every evening at Sunne going downe thou have sight of the land, and so thou must do being in the chanell, untill thou bring thy selfe into the middest of the chanell: and thou must lye off from the going downe of the sunne, untill the ende of the first watch with thy coarses alone, without any more sayle; and from midnight forwards cast about, and lye the other way with the like sayle untill day: and thus thou must doe untill thou bring thy selfe into the chanel.

And if thou be benighted, and comming into 8. or 9. fathoms, then I wish thee to come to anchor, untill it be day, and then call for a Pilote, that may by some meanes carie thee into harbour. I advise thee, if in the Winter time thou bee shot out of the narrowest of the Chanel of Bahama, and wouldest goe for Spaine, that thou must goe East Northeast, untill thou be in 30. degrees rather lesse then more; and then thou mayest goe East and by South, because of the variation of the Compasse. And stirring hence East Southeast, thou shalt goe on the Southside of Bermuda: and must goe with great care, because many have bene lost heere about this Island, because of their negligence. And when thou art sure thou art past this Island, then goe East Northeast, untill thou bee in the height of seven and thirtie degrees: which is in the height of the Island of Saint Marie. And going thus, and not seeing Land, but seeing the Sea to breake, make account it is the rocks called las Hormigas. And if thou thinke good to goe to Faial, thou shalt goe till thou be in 38. degrees J scant, and then thou shalt goe East, and so shalt have sight of Faial. The markes of it be these.* Comming out from Faial, and leaving all the Islandes, then all goe East and by South untill thou bring thy selfe in 37. degrees, which is the height of Cape Saint Vincent: and then goe East, and thou shalt see the Cape having the markes aforesayd. And from Cape S. Vincent thou must goe East Southeast, till thou be Northeast, and Southwest, with the barre of S. Lucar: and then goe Northeast for the Barre. Take this for a warning, that if going in 37. degrees thou have not sight of Cape S.

And from that poynt to Baracoa is 7. leagues. And being disposed to goe into Baracoa, keepe the Baracoa. weather-shore all along, untill thou open the Harbour. And to knowe if thou bee open of the Harbour, looke upon the South side; and thou shalt see an Hill by it selfe, which maketh as it were a crowne upon it. And if thou come along, it maketh as it were a Fort with Ports about it: And this is the marke if thou come out of the Sea. And this Hill is North and South of the Harbour, over the Harbour of Baracoa. And if thou wilt goe in, thou must take heede of a Shoald which Asholdonthe lyeth on the East side, and thou must keepe the West East 5tde °f side: and goe not much from the Shoald, because the Baracoafoote of the Shoald that shooteth Westward hath 5. fathoms water. And when thou art within the Shoalds, thou must goe a litle within them, and then let fall an anchor: and looke that thou come not much on the East side, for it is shoaldie. And comming out from Baracoa, being to passe the old chanel, you shal set your course through Northwest until you come with the Cayo de Moa, or CayodeMoa. the shoald of Moa, untill you thinke you are Northeast de Moa. For before you come at it by 2. leagues or more, you shall understand that it hath a poynt of lowe land, and upon the poynt it hath a Palme tree; which tree you shall see alwayes, before you see the point: and it is like a sayle. From thence to the Pracellas or Flats you shall stirre Northwest two parts of your way, that you have to runne from Cayo de Moa to the sayd Pracellas or Flats, and the one halfe part of the way North Northwest and by West. And this way you shall see the Pracellas or Flats in a cleane place of the shoald above the water, for all the breach of the sea. The Mosowes bee from the Pracell West, and you shall leave them to windward. looke that when you come from And if you will goe with the Pracellas or Flats, you shall finde 4. or 5. fathomes: and you may goe sure without danger a Northwest course untill you come in 7. fathomes. And if you will goe upon the Shoald, you shall goe upon that depth, untill you have runne 40. or 45. leagues: And from thence you shall set your course Southwest, till you see the Flattes of the maine land. You shall then see to the Westward a rocke divided into 3. partes, which is called the Camoloquea. And the Pracellas Southwest, you have certaine Flats before you: take heede of them that you fall not by night with them by foure leagues, for feare of the Mecala: and you shall set your course West Northwest untill day: and when it is day, you must beare close aboord the shore, and then you shall see a flat Island with many broken sands, which is called Cropeda, and lyeth but a little out of the trade way, somewhat to the Northward.
