Cui muneri Baldwinus sollicite invigilans, egregium se pastorem exhibuit, dominicum semen, quantum patiebatur ejus iniquitas, ubique locorum spargens. Richardus Anglorum rex, acceptis tune regni insigniis, summo studio classem, ac omnia ad Hierosolymitanum bellum gerendum necessaria paravit. Secutus est illico regem in Syriam, & Palaestinam usque Baldwinus, ut esset in tarn Sancto (ut ipse putabat) itinere laborum, dolorum, ac periculorum particeps. Praefuit Cantuariensi Ecclesiae fere 6. annis, & Richardum regem in Syriam secutus, anno Salutis nostrae 1190. Tyri vitam finivit, ubi & sepultus est. temporis The same in English.

Fol. 229. travailes of the r Nter primos Thomae Becketi successor hie secundus, audita salvatoris & salutiferas Crucis injuria nostris (proh dolor) diebus per Saladinum irrogata, cruce signatus, in ejusdem obsequiis, tarn remotis finibus quam propinquis, praedicationis officium viriliter assumpsit. Et postmodum iter accipiens, navigi6que fungens apud Marsiliam, transcurso tandem pelagi profundo, in portu Tyrensi incolumis applicuit: & inde ad exercitum nostrum obsidentem pariter & obsessum Aconem transivit: ubi multos ex nostris inveniens, & fere cunctos principum defectu, in summa desolatione jam positos, & desperatione, alios quidem longa expectatione fatigatos, alios fame & inopia graviter afflictos, quosdam vero a£ris inclementia distemperatos, diem foeliciter in terra sacra clausurus extremum, singulos pro posse vinculo charitatis amplectens, sumptibus & impensis, verbis, & vitae meritis confirmavit.

THis Baldwine being the second successor unto Thomas Becket, after he had heard ye wrong which was done to our Saviour, and the signe of the Crosse by Saladine the Sultan of Egypt, taking upon him the Lords Character, he couragiously perfourmed his office of preaching in the obedience thereof, as well in farre distant Countreis as at home. And afterwards taking his journey and imbarking himselfe at Marseils, having at length passed ye Levant sea, he arrived safely in the Haven of Tyrus, and from thence went over to Achon unto our armie, besieging the Towne, and yet (as it were) besieged it selfe: where finding many of our Countreymen, and almost all men remaining in wonderfull pensivenesse and despaire, through the withdrawing of the Princes, some of them tyred with long expectation, others grievously afflicted with hunger and povertie, and others distempered with the heate of the weather, being ready happily to ende his dayes in the Holy land, embracing every one according to his abilitie in the bond of love, he ayded them at his costes and charges, and strengthened them with his wordes and good examples of life.
