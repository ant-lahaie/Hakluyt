Antonius anno a nato in salutem nostram Christo, 1310, Edwardo secundo regnante. The same in English. ANthony Beck was bishop of Durisme in the time of the reigne of Edward the first of that name after the invasion of William the great into England. This Anthony was elected patriarch of Jerusalem in the yeere of our Lord God 1305, and was confirmed by Clement the fift, pope of Rome. He was of greater magnificence then for the calling of a bishop. He founded also the castle of Acheland foure miles from Durisme, on the shore of a prety river called Unduglesme. He much beautified with new buildings Eltham mannor being nere unto Greenwich, and the castle Somaridune in the county of Lindsey. And lastly, he built new out of the ground the palace of London, which now is in the possession of prince Edward. Insomuch, that at length, through his over great magnificence and power he procured to himselfe great envy among the nobility, which he could not asswage during the rest of his life. But of this Anthony & of his writings we will speake more at large in our booke intitled of the Britain bishops. This Anthony finished his life in the yere of our Lord God 1310, and in the reigne of king Edward the second. Incipit Itinerarium fratris Odorici fratrum minorum de mirabilibus Orientalium Tartarorum. Icet multa & varia de ritibus & conditionibus hujus mundi enarrentur a multis, ego tamen frater Odoricus de foro Julii de portu Vahonis, volens ad partes infidelium transfretare, magna & mira vidi & audivi, quae possum veratransiens Mare citer enarrare. Primo transtuli Armenia maJor- T HE ENGLISH VOYAGES Trapesundam, quse antiquitus Pontus vocabatur : Haec terra benfe situata est5 sicut scala quasdam Persarum & Medorum, & eorum qui sunt ultra mare. In hac terra vidi mirabile quod mihi placuit, scilicet hominem ducentem secum plusquam 4000 perdicum. Homo autem per terram gradiebatur, perdices vero volabant per a€ra, quas ipse ad quoddam castrum dictum Zavena duxit, distans a Trapesunda per tres dietas : Hae perdices illius conditionis erant, cum homo ille quiescere voluit, omnes se aptabant circa ipsum, more pullorum gallinarum, & per ilium modum duxit eas usque ad Trapesundam, & usque ad palatium imperatoris, qui de illis sumpsit quot voluit, & residuas vir ille ad locum unde venerat, adduxit. In hac civitate requiescit corpus Athanasii supra portam civitatis. Ultra transivi usque in Armeniam majorem, ad quandam civitatem quae vocatur Azaron, quae erat multum opulenta antiquitus, sed Tartari earn pro magna parte destruxerunt : In ea erat abundantia panis & carnium, & aliorum omnium victualium praeterquam vini & fructuum. Haec civitas est multum frigida, & de ilia dicitur quod altius situatur quam aliqua alia in hoc mundo : haec optimas habet aquas, nam venae illarum aquarum oriri videntur & scaturire a flumine magno Euphrate quod per unam dietam ab civitate distat : haec civitas via media eundi Taurisium. Ultra progressus sum ad quendam montem dictum Sobissacalo. In ilia contrata est mons ille supra quern requiescit area Noe ; in quern libenter ascendissem, si societas mea me praestolare voluisset: A gente tamen illius contratae dicitur quod nullus unquam ilium montem ascendere potuit, quia ut dicitur, hoc Deo Taurjs civitas altissimo non placet. Ultra veni Tauris civitatem magPersice. n am g^ regakn^ qUae antiquitus Susis dicta est. Haec civitas melior pro mercenariis reputatur, quam aliqua quae sit in mundo, nam nihil comestibile, nee aliquid quod ad mercimonium pertinet, reperitur, quod illic in bona copia non habetur. Haec civitas multum bene situatur: Nam ad earn quasi totus mundus pro mercimoniis confluere potest : De hac dicunt Christiani qui ibi sunt, quod credunt Imperatorem plus de ea accipere, quam Regem Franciae de toto regno suo: Juxta illam civitatem est mons salinus praebens sal civitati, & de illo sale unusquisque tantum accipit, quantum vult, nihil solvendo alicui. In hac civitate multi Christiani de omni natione commorantur, quibus Saraceni in omnibus dominantur. Ultra ivi per decem dietas ad civitatem dictam Soldania, in qua imperator Persarum commoratur; In hyeme autem vadit ad civitatem aliam sitam supra mare vocatam Bakuc: Praedicta autem civitas magna est, & frigida, in se habens bonas aquas, ad quam multa mercimonia portantur. Ultra cum quadam societate Caravanorum ivi versus Indiam superiorem, ad quam dum transissem per multas dietas perveni ad civitatem trium Magorum quae vocatur Cassan, quae regia civitas Vel Cassibin. est & nobilis, nisi quod Tartari earn in magna parte destruxerunt: haec abundat pane, vino, & aliis bonis multis. Ab hac civitate usque Jerusalem quo Magi iverunt miraculose, sunt L. dietae, & multa mirabilia sunt in hac civitate quae pertranseo. Inde recessi ad quandam civitatem vocatam Gest a qua distat mare arenosum per Gest. unam dietam, quod mire est mirabile & periculosum: In hac civitate est abundantia omnium victualium, & ficuum potissime, & uvarum siccarum & viridium, plus ut credo quam in alia parte mundi. Haec est tertia civitas melior quam Rex Persarum habet in toto regno suo: De ilia dicunt Saraceni, quod in ea nullus Christianus ultra annum vivere unquam potest. Ultra per multas dietas ivi ad quandam civitatem dictam Comum quae maxima Como. civitas antiquitus erat, cujus ambitus erat fere L. miliaria, quae magna damna intulit Romanis antiquis temporibus. In ea sunt palatia integra non habitata, tamen multis victualibus abundat. Ultra per multas terras transiens, perveni ad terram Job nomine Hus quae omnium victualium plenissima est, & pulcherrime situata; juxta earn sunt montes in quibus sunt pascua multa pro animalibus: Ibi manna in magna copia reperitur. Ibi habentur quatuor perdices pro minori, quam pro uno grosso: In faeminae non : haec terra correspondet Chaldeae versus transmontana. De moribus Chaldaeorum, & de India. INde ivi in Chaldaeam quae est regnum magnum, & transivi juxta turrim Babel: Haec regio suam linguam propriam habet, & ibi sunt homines formosi, & foeminae turpes : & homines illius regionis vadunt compti crinibus, & ornati, ut hie mulieres, & portant super capita sua fasciola aurea cum gemmis, & margaritis; mulieres vero solum unam vilem camisiam attingentem usque ad genua, habentem manicas longas & largas, quae usque ad terram protenduntur: Et vadunt discalciatae portantes Serablans usque ad terram. Triceas non portant, sed capilli earum circumquaque disperguntur : & alia multa & mirabilia sunt ibidem. Inde veni in Indiam quae infra terram est, quam Tartari multum destruxerunt; & in ea ut plurimum homines tantum dactilos comedunt, quarum xlii. librae habentur pro minori quam pro uno grosso. Ultra [II. i. 41.] transivi per multas dietas ad mare oceanum, & prima terra, ad quam applicui, vocatur Ormes, quae est optim& Ormus. murata, & multa mercimonia & divitiae in ea sunt; in ea tantus calor est, quod virilia hominum exeunt corpus, & descendunt usque ad mediam tibiarum : ideo homines illius terrae volentes vivere, faciunt unctionum, & ungunt ilia, & sic uncta in quibusdam sacculis ponunt circa se cingentes, & aliter morerentur: In hac terra homines utuntur navigio quae vocatur Jase, sutum sparto. Ego autem ascendi in unum illorum in quo nullum ferrum potui reperire, & in viginti octo dietis perveni ad civitatern Thana, in qua pro fide Christi quatuor de fratribus nostris martyrizati sunt. Haec terra est optimfe situata, & in ea abundantia panis & vini, & aliorum victualium. Haec terra antiquitias fuit valde magna, & fuit regis Pori, qui cum rege Alexandro praelium magnum commisit. Hujus terrae populus ldolatrat, adorans ignem, serpentes, & arbores: Et istam terram regunt Saraceni, qui violenter 374 Ibi sunt diversa genera bestiarum, leones nigri in maxima quantitate: Sunt & ibi simiae, gatimaymones, & noctuae magnae sicut hie habentur columbae ; ibi mures magni sunt, sicut sunt hie scepi, & ideo canes capiunt ibi mures, quia murelegi non valent. Ad haec, in ilia terra quilibet homo habet ante domum suam unum pedem fasciculorum, ita magnum sicut esset una columna, & pes ille non desiccatur, dummodo adhibeatur sibi aqua. ibi, quas pulcherrimum esset Multae novitates sunt audire. De martyrio fratrum. MArtyrium autem quatuor fratrum nostrorum in ilia civitate Thana fuit per istum modum ; dum praedicti fratres fuerant in Ormes, fecerunt pactum cum una navi, ut navigarent usque Polumbrum, & violenter deportati sunt usque Thanam ubi sunt 15. domus Chris- tianorum, qui Nestoriani sunt & Schismatici, & cum illic essent, hospitati sunt in domo cujusdam illorum ; contigit dum ibi manerent litem oriri inter virum domus, & uxorem ejus, quam sero vir fortiter verberavit, quae suo Kadi, 1. Episcopo conquesta est; a qua interrogavit Kadi, utrum hoc probari posset ? quae dixit, quod sic; quia 4. Franchi, 1. viri religiosi erant in domo hoc videntes, ipsos interrogate, qui dicent vobis veritatem: Muliere autem sic dicente, Ecce unus de Alexandria praesens rogavit Kadi ut mitteret pro eis, dicens eos esse homines maximae scientiae & scripturas benfe scire, & ideo dixit bonum esse cum illis de fide disputare: Qui misit pro illis, & adducti sunt isti quatuor, quorum nomina sunt frater de Tolentino de Marchia, frater Jacobus de Padua, frater Demetrius Laicus, Petrus de Senis. Dimisso autem fratre Petro, ut res suas custodiret, ad Kadi perrexerunt, qui coepit cum illis de fide nostra disputare; dicens Christum tantiim hominem esse & non Deum. E contra frater Thomas rationibus & exemplis Christum verum Deum & hominem esse evidenter ostendit, & in rationabiliter contradicere: quod non habuerunt quid Tune videns Kadi se sic confusum, incepit clamare sic; Et quid dicis de Machometo ? Respondit frater Thomas: Si tibi probavimus Christum verum Deum & hominem esse, qui legem posuit inter homines, et Machometus e contrario venit, & legem contrariam docuit, si sapiens sis optime scire poteris, quid de eo dicendum sit. Iterum Kadi & alii Saraceni clamabant, Et tu quid iterum de Machometo dicis ? Tune frater T. respondit: vos omnes videre potestis, quid dico de eo. Turn ex quo vultis qu6d plane loquar de eo, dico, quod Machometus vester filius perditionis est, & in inferno cum Diabolo patre suo. Et non solum ipse, sed omnes ibi erunt qui tenent legem hanc, quia ipsa tota pestifera est, & falsa, & contra Deum, & contra salutem animae. Hoc audientes Saraceni, coeperunt clamare, moriatur, moriatur ille, qui sic contra Prophetam locutus est. Tune acceperunt fratres & in sole urente stare permiserunt, ut ex calore solis adusti, dira morte interirent. Tantus enim est calor solis ibi, qu6d si homo in eo per spacium unius missae persisteret, moreretur: fratres tamen illi sani & hilares a tertia usque ad nonam laudantes & glorificantes dominum in ardore solis permanserunt, quod videntes Saraceni stupefacti ad fratres venerunt, & dixerunt, volumus ignem accendere copiosum, & in ilium vos projicere, & si fides vestra sit ut dicitis, ignis non poterit vos comburere: si autem vos combusserit, patebit quod fides vestra nulla sit, Responderunt fratres; parati sumus pro fide nostra ignem, carcerem, & vincula, & omnium tormentorum genera tolerare: veruntamen scire debetis, quod si ignis potestatem habeat comburendi nos hoc non erit propter fidem nostram, sed propter peccata nostra: fides enim nostra perfectissima & verissima est, & non est alia in mundo in qua animae hominum possunt salvae fieri. Dum autem ordinaretur quod fratres comburerentur, rumor insonuit per totam civitatem, de qua omnes senes, & juvenes, viri & mulieres, qui ire poterant, accurrerunt ad illud spectaculum Fratres autem ducti fuerunt ad plateam civitatis, ubi accensus est ignis copiosus, in quern frater Thomas voluit se projicere, sed quidam Saracenus cepit eum per caputium, & retraxit, dicens; Non vadas tu cum sis senex, quia carmen aliquod [II. i. 42.] vel experimentum habere posses super te, quare te ignis non posset laedere, sed alium ire in ignem permittas. Tune 4 Saraceni sumentes fratrem Jacobum, eum in ignem projicere volebant; quibus ille, permittatis me, quia libenter pro fide mea ignem intrabo: Cui Saraceni non adquiescentes eum violenter in ignem projecerunt: ignis autem ita accensus erat, qu6d nullus eum videre poterat, vocem tamen ejus audierunt, invocantem semper nomen virginis gloriosas ; Igne autem totaliter consumpto stetit frater Jacobus super prunas illaesus, & laetus, manibus in modum crucis elevatis, in coelum respiciens, & Deum laudans & glorificans, qui sic declararet fidem suam : nihil autem in eo nee pannus, nee capillus laesus per ignem inventus est; Quod videns populus unanimiter conclamare coepit, sancti sunt, sancti sunt, nefas est offendere eos, modo videmus quia fides eorum bona & sancta est. Tune clamare coepit Kadi : sanctus non est ille, quia combustus non est, quia tunica quam portat est de lana terrae Habraae, & ideo nudus exspolietur, & in ignem projiciatur, & videbitur si comburetur vel non. Tune Saraceni pessimi ad praeceptum Kadi ignem in duplo magis quam prius accenderunt, & fratrem Jacobum nudantes, corpus suum abluerunt, & oleo abundantissime unxerunt, insuper & oleum maximum in struem lignorum ex quibus ignis fieret, fuderunt, & igne accenso fratrem in ipsum projecerunt. Frater autem Thomas, & frater Demetrius extra populum in loco separato flexis genibus orantes cum lachrymis devotioni se dederunt. Frater autem Jacobus iterum ignem exivit illaesus sicut prius fecerat : quod videns omnis populus clamare coepit, peccatum est, peccatum est, offendere eos, quia sancti sunt. Hoc autem tantum miraculum videns Melich. i. potestas civitatis, vocavit ad se fratrem Jacobum, & fecit eum ponere indumenta sua, & dixit, videte fratres, Ite cum gratia Dei, quia nullum malum patiemini a nobis, mod6 benfe videmus vos sanctos esse, & fidem vestram bonam ac veram esse ; & ideo consulimus vobis, ut de ista terra exeatis, quam citius poteritis, quia Kadi pro posse suo vobis nocere curabit, quia sic confudistis eum : Hora autem tune erat quasi completorii, & dixerunt illi de populo, attoniti, admirati, & stupefacti, tot & tanta mirabilia vidimus ab istis hominibus, quod nescimus quid tenere & observare debemus. Melich vero fecit duci illos tres fratres ultra unum parvum brachium maris in quendam Burgum modicum ab ilia civitate distantem: ad quern etiam ille in cujus jam domo fuerant hospitati associavit eos, ubi in domo cujusdam idolatri recepti sunt. Dhm haec agerentur, Kadi ivit ad Melich, dicens quid facimus ? Lex Machometi destructa est, veruntamen hoc scire debes, quod Machomet praecepit in suo Alcorano, tantum quod si quis unum Christianum mereretur, ac si in Mecha ad ipsum peregrinaretur. Est enim Alkoranus lex Saracenorum sicut Evangelium, Mecha vero est locus ubi jacet Machomet. Quern locum ita visitant Saraceni, sicut Christiani sepulchrum Christi. Tune Melich respondet, vade & fac sicut vis : quo dicto statim Kadi accepit quatuor homines armatos ut irent, & illos fratres interficerent, qui cum aquam transiissent, facta est nox, & illo sero eos non invenerunt, statim Melich omnes Christianos in civitate capi fecit, & incarceravit, media autem nocte fratres surrexerunt dicere matutinum, quos illi Saraceni qui missi fuerant, invenerunt, & extra burgum, sub quadam arbore adduxerunt, dixerunt eis. Sciatis fratres nos mandatum habere a Kadi & Melich interficere vos, quod tamen faciemus inviti, quia vos estis boni homines & sancti, sed non audemus aliter facere ; quia si jussa sua non perficeremus, & nos cum liberis nostris & uxoribus moreremur. Tune fratres responderunt, vos qui htic venistis, & tale mandatum recepistis, ut per mortem temporalem vitam seternam adipiscamur, quod vobis injunctum est perficite ; quia 378 pro amore domini nostri Jesu Christi, qui pro nobis crucifigi & mori dignatus est, & pro fide nostra, parati sumus omnia tormenta, & etiam mortem libenter sustinere. Christianus autem qui comitabatur, multum cum illis quatuor armatis altercatus est dicens, quod si gladium haberet, vel eos a nece tarn sanctorum hominum impediret, vel ipse cum eis interfectus esset. Tune armati fecerunt fratres se exspoliare, & frater Thomas primus junctis manibus in modum crucis genu flectens capitis abscissionem suscepit : Fratrem vero Jacobum unus percussit in capite, & eum usque ad oculos scidit, & alio ictu totum caput abscidit. Frater autem Demetrius prim6 percussus est cum gladio in pectore, & secundo caput suum abscissum est: Statim ut fratres suum martyrium compleverunt, aer ita lucidus effectus est, quod omnes admirati sunt, & luna maximam claritatem ostendit. Statim quasi subito tanta tonitrua, & fulgura, & coruscationes, & obscuritas fiebant, quod omnes mori crediderunt : Navis etiam ilia quae illos debuerat deportasse submersa est cum omnibus quae in se habuit, ita quod nunquam de ilia postea aliquid scitum est. Facto mane misit Kadi pro rebus fratrum frater praedictorum nostrorum, & tune Petrus de Senis quartus socius fratrum praedictorum, quern ad Kadi duxerunt : Cui Kadi, & alii Saraceni maxima promittentes persuaserunt quod fidem suam renueret, & legem machometi confiteretur, & teneret. Frater autem Petrus de illis truffabat, eos multum deridendo, quern de mane usque ad meridiem diversis [II. i. 43.} paenarum ac tormentorum generibus aflixerunt ipso semper constantissime in fide, & in Dei laudibus persistente, & fidem illorum Machometi deridente & destruente. Videntes autem Saraceni eum non posse a suo proposito evelli, eum super quandam arborem suspenderunt, in qua de nona usque ad noctem vivus & illaesus pependit: nocte vero ipsum de arbore sumpserunt, & videntes ilium laetum, vivum, & illaesum per medium suum corpus diviserunt, mane autem facto nihil de corpore inventus est ejus inventum est, uni tamen personae fide dignse revelatum est, quod Deus corpus ejus occultaverat revelandum in certo tempore, quando Deo placuerit Sanctorum corpora manifestare. Ut autem Deus ostenderet animas suorum martyrum jam in coelis consistere, & congaudere cum Deo & Angelis & aliis Sanctis ejus, die sequenti post martyrium fratrum praedictorum Melich dormitioni se dedit, & ecce aparuerunt sibi isti fratres gloriosi, & sicut Sol, lucidi, singulos enses tenentes in manibus, & supra eum eos sic vibrantes, quod ut si eum perfodere ac dividere vellent : qui excitatus horribiliter exclamavit, sic, quod totam familiam terruit : quae sibi accurrens quaesivit, quid sibi esset ? quibus ille, Illi Raban Franchi quos interfici jussi, venerunt hue ad me cum ensibus, volentes me interficere. Et statim Melich misit pro Kadi, referens sibi visionem, & petens consilium, & consola- tionem, quia timuit per eos finaliter interire. Tune Kadi sibi consuluit, ut illis maximas eleemosynas faceret, si de manibus interfectorum evadere vellet. Tune misit pro Christianis quos in carcere intrudi praeceperat : A quibus cum ad eum venissent indulgentiam petiit pro facto suo, dicens se esse amodo socium eorum, & confratrem : Praecepit autem & legem statuit, quod pro tempore suo, si quis aliquem Christianum offenderet, statim moreretur, & sic omnes illaesos, & indemnes abire permisit. Pro illis autem quatuor fratribus interfectis quatuor mosquetas. (i.) Ecclesias aedificari fecit, quas per Sacerdotes Saracenorum inhabitari fecit, Audiens autem imperator Dodsi istos tres fratres talem sententiam subiisse, misit pro Melich, ut vinctus ad eum duceretur, A quo cum adductus esset, quaesivit imperator, quare ita crudelit&r illos fratres jusserat interfici, respondit, quia subvertere volebant legem nostram, & malum & blasphemiam de propheta nostro dicebant: & imperator ad eum ; O crudelissime canis, cum videres quod Deus omnipotens bis ab igne eos liberaverit, quo modo ausus fuisti illis mortem inferre tarn crudelem. Et edicta sententia, ipsum Melich cum tota sua familia per medium scindi fecit, sicut ipse talem mortem fratri inflixerat. Kadi ver6 audiens, de terra ilia, & etiam de imperatoris illius dominio clam fugit, & sic evasit. De miraculis quatuor fratrum occisorum. mortua non traduntur sepulturae, sed ESt autem consuetudo in terra ilia, quod corpora in campis dimittuntur, & ex calore Solis cito resolvuntur, & sic consumuntur : Corpora autem trium fratrum prasdictorum per 14. dies illic in fervore Solis jacuerunt, & ita recentia & redolentia inventa fuerunt sicut ilia die quando martirizati erant : quod videntes Christiani qui in ilia terra habitabant, praedicta corpora ceperunt, & honorifice sepelierunt. Ego autem Odoricus audiens factum & martyrium illorum fratrum, ivi illuc, & corpora eorum effodi, & ossa omnia mecum accepi, & in pulchris towalliis colligavi, & in Indiam superiorem ad unum locum fratrum nostrorum ea deportavi, habens mecum socium, & unum famulum. Cum autem essemus in via, hospitabamus in domo cujusdam hospitarii, & ipsa ossa capiti meo supposui, & dormivi : Et dum dormirem domus ilia a Saracenis subito accendebatur, ut me cum domo comburerent. Domo autem sic accensa, socius meus & famulus de domo exierunt, & me solum cum ossibus dimiserunt, qui videns ignem supra me, ossa accepi & cum illis in angulos domus recollegi. Tres autem anguli domus statim combusti fuerunt, angulo in quo steti cum ossibus salvo remanente : Supra me autem ignis se tenuit in modum aeris lucidi, nee descendit quamdiu ibi persistebam ; quam cit6 autem cum ossibus exivi, statim tota pars ilia sicut aliae priores igne consumpta est, & multa alia loca circumadjacentia combusta sunt. Aliud miraculum contigit, me cum ossibus per mare proficiente ad civitatem Polumbrum ubi piper nascitur abundanter, quia nobis ventus totaliter defecit: quapropter venerunt Idolatrae adorantes Deos suos pro vento prospero, quern tamen non obtinuerunt : Tune Saraceni suas invocationes, & adorationes laboriose fecerunt, sed nihil pro- tempus impetrare. Cum autem fecerunt; Et pneceptum est mihi & socio meo ut orationes funderemus Deo nostro : Et dixit rector navis in Armenico mihi, quod alii non intelligerent: quod nisi possemus ventum prosperum a Deo nostro impetrare, nos cum ossibus in mare projicerent : Tune ego & socius fecimus orationes, voventes multas missas de beata virgine celebrare, sic quod ventum placeret sibi nobis transiret, & ventus non veniret, accepi unum de ossibus, & dedi famulo, ut ad caput navis iret, & clam in mare projiceret; quo projecto statim affuit ventus prosper qui nunquam nobis defecit, usquequo pervenimus ad portum, meritis istorum martyrum cum salute. Deinde Indiam superiorem ascendimus aliam navem ut iremus ; Et venimus ad quandam civitatem vocatam Carchan in qua sunt duo loca fratrum nostrorum, & In navi autem ibi reponere istas reliquias volebamus. [II. i. 44.] ilia erant plus 700. mercatores & alii : Nunc illi Idolatrae istam consuetudinem habebant, quod semper ante- quam ad portum applicuerint, totam navem perquirerent, si isti aliqua ossa mortuorum animalium invenirent, in mare projicerent, & per hoc qui reperta statim bonum portum attingere, & mortis periculum evadere crederent. Cum autem frequenter perquirerent, & ilia ossa frequenter tangerent, semper oculi delusi fuerunt, locum sic quod fratrum deportavimus cum omni reverentia, ubi in pace requiescunt; ubi etiam inter idolatras Deus continue miracula operatur. Cum enim aliquo morbo gravantur, in terra ilia ubi fratres passi sunt ipsi vadunt, & de terra ubi corpora sanguinolenta jacuerunt sumunt quam abluunt, & ablutionem bibunt, & sic ab infirmitatibus suis liberantur. ilia non perpenderunt; & sic ad Quo modo habetur Piper, & ubi nascitur. UT autem videatur quo modo habetur piper, sciendum quod in quodam imperio ad quod applicui, Malabar, nomine * Minibar, nascitur, & in nulla parte mundi in tantum, quantum ibi ; Nemus enim in quo nascitur, continet octodecim dietas, & in ipso nemore sunt duae civitates una nomine Flandrina, alia nomine Cyncilim : In Flandrina habitant Judaei aliqui & aliqui Christiani, inter quos est bellum frequenter, sed Christiani vincunt In isto nemore habetur piper per Judaeos semper: istum modum. Nam prim6 nascitur in foliis olerum, quae juxta magnas arbores plantantur, sicut nos ponimus vites; & producunt fructum, sicut racemi nostri producunt uvas ; sed quand6 maturescunt sunt viridis coloris, & sic vindemiantur ut inter nos vindemiantur uvae, & ponuntur grana ad solem ut desiccentur : quae desiccata reponuntur in vasis terreis, & sic fit piper, & In isto autem nemore sunt flumina multa custoditur. in quibus sunt Crocodili multi, & multi alii serpentes sunt illo nemore, quos homines per stupam & paleas comburunt, & sic ad colligendum piper secure accedunt. A capite illius nemoris versus meridiem est civitas Polumbrum in qua maxima mercimonia cujus- Polumbrum cunque generis reperiuntur. Omnes autem de terra ilia afttas\ bovem vivum sicut Deum suum adorant, quern 6. ipsum annis faciunt quiescere ab omni opere; ponentes loco solemni, & communi, & dicentes ipsum esse animal sanctum. Hunc autem ritum observant : quolibet mane accipiunt duas pelves de auro, vel de argento, & unam submittunt urinae bovis, & aliam stercori, de urina lavant sibi faciem & oculos, & omnes 5. sensus : de stercore vero ponunt in utr6que oculo, postea liniunt summitates genarum, & tertio pectus, & ex tune dicunt se sanctificatos pro toto die illo : & sicut facit populus, ita etiam facit rex & regina. Isti etiam aliud idolum mortuum adorant, quod in medietate una superior est homo, & in alia est bos, & illud idolum dat eis responsa, & aliquotiens pro stipendio petit sanguinem, 40. virginum : & ita ideo homines vovent filias suas & filios, sicut Christiani aliqui alicui religioni, vel sancto in coelis. Et per istum modum 383 laborare, & in septimo faciunt regionis ipsum illius immolant filios & filias, & multi homines per istum illud, & multa alia idolum ritum moriuntur ante abominabilia facit populus iste bestialis, & multa mirabilia vidi inter eos quae nolui hie inserere. Aliam consuetudinem vilissimam habet gens ilia : Nam quando Combustio homo moritur, comburunt ipsum mortuum, & si uxomortuorum. r em ^abet, ipsam comburunt vivam, quia dicunt quod ipsa ibit in aratura, & cultura cum viro suo in alio mundo : Si autem uxor ilia habeat liberos ex viro suo, potest manere cum eis si velit sine verecundia & improperio, communiter tamen omnes praeeligunt comburi cum marito ; si autem uxor praemoriatur viro, lex ilia non obligat virum, sed potest aliam uxorem ducere. Aliam consuetudinem habet gens ilia, quod foeminae ibi bibunt vinum, & homines non : foeminae etiam faciunt sibi radi cilia, & supercilia, & barbam, & homines non: & sic de multis aliis vilibus contra naturam sexus eorum. Ab isto regno ivi decem dietas ad aliud regn um dictum Mobar, quod habet in se multas civitates, Mobar regnum ve g^ j n QJQ req uiescit in una ecclesia corpus beati Thomas Apostoli, & est ecclesia ilia plena ldolis, & in circuitu ecclesiae simul Canonici vivunt in 15. domibus Nestoriani, id est, mali Christiani, & schismatici. De quodam idolo mirabili, & de quibusdam ritibus eorum. IN hoc regno est unum Idolum mirabile, quod omnes Indi reverentur : & est statura hominis ita magni, sicut noster Christophorus depictus, & est totum de auro purissimo & splendidissimo, & circa collum habet unam chordulam sericam cum lapidibus pretiosissimis> regnum : quorum aliquis valet plus quam unum Domus tecto, & in pavimento, & superficie parietum interius & exterius. Ad illud idolum peregrinantur Indi, sicut nos ad S.

Parietes vero omnes interius sunt laminati laminis aureis, in quibus sculpti sunt Equites de auro habentes circa caput circulum aureum plenum lapidibus pretiosis : Tectum est de auro puro.

Iste rex habet decies millesies & quatuor elephantum domesticorum, quos ita facit custodiri sicut inter nos custodiunt boves, vel greges in pascuis. I De multitudine Piscium, qui se projiciunt in aridam. N hac contrata unum mirabile valde reperitur, quod unaquaeque generatio piscium in mari ad istam contratam venit in tanta quantitate, quod per magnum spatium maris nil videtur nisi dorsa piscium, & super aridam se projiciunt quando prope ripam sunt, & permittunt homines per tres dies venire, & de illis sumere quantum placuerint, & tune redeunt ad mare: Post illam speciem per ilium modum venit alia species, & offert se, & sic de omnibus speciebus, semel tamen tantum hoc faciunt in anno. Et quaesivi a gente ilia quomodo & qualiter hoc possit fieri ? responderunt qu6d hoc modo pisces per naturam docentur venire, & imperatorem Testitudines suum revereri. rnagn*. Ibi etiam sunt testitudines ita magnse s j c ut e st u n us furnuS5 & m u l ta aJia Yifc qUse i^credibilia forent, nisi homo ilia vidisset.

Ultra transivi per mare Oceanum versus meridiem, & transivi per multas contratas & insulas, quarum una vocatur Moumoran, Moumoran. & habet in circuitu 2000. milliaria, in qua homines portant facies caninas & mulieres similit&r, & unum bovem adorant pro Deo suo, & ide6 quilibet unum bovem aureum vel argenteum in fronte portat : Homines illius contratae & mulieres vadunt totaliter nudi, nisi quod unum pannum lineum portant ante verenda sua. Homines illius regionis sunt maximi & fortissimi, & quia vadunt nudi, quando debent bellare, portant unum scutum de ferro, quod cooperit eos a capite usque ad pedes, & si contingat eos aliquem de adversariis capere in bello qui pecunia non possit redimi, statim comedunt eum ; si autem possit se redimere pecunia, ilium abire permittunt: Rex eorum portat 300. margaritas ad collum suum maximas & pulcherrimas, & 300. orationes omni die dicit Deo suo : Hie etiam portat in digito suo unum lapidem longitudinis unius spansae, & dum habet ilium videtur ab aliis quasi una flamma ignis, & ideo nullus audet sibi appropinquare, & dicitur quod non est lapis in mundo pretiosior illo. Magnus autem imperator Tartarorum de Katai, nunquam vi, nee pecunia, nee ingenio ilium obtinere potuit, cum tamen circa hoc laboraverit. De Insula Ceilan, & de monte ubi Adam planxit Abel filium suum. TRansivi per aliam insulam vocatam Ceilan, quas Ceilan insula. habet in ambitu plusquam duo millia milliaria, in qua sunt serpentes quasi infiniti, & maxima multitudo leonum, ursarum, & omnium animalium rapacium, & In ilia contrata silvestrium, & potissime elephantum. est mons maximus, in quo dicunt gentes illius regionis quod Adam planxit Abel filium suum 500 annis. In medio illius montis est planicies pulcherrima, in qua est lacus parvus multum habens de aqua, & homines illi dicunt aquam illam fuisse de lachrymis Adae & Evae, sed probavi hoc falsum ess-, quia vidi aquam in lacu scaturire: haec aqua plena est hirudinibus & sanguisugis, & lapidibus pretiosis ; istos lapides rex non accipit sibi, sed semel vel bis in anno permittit pauperes sub aqua ire pro lapidibus, & omnes quot possunt colligere illis concedit, ut orent pro anima sua. Ut autem possint sub aqua ire accipiunt lymones, & cum illis ungunt se valde ben&, & sic nudos se in aquam submergunt, & sanguisugae illis nocere non possunt. Ab isto lacu aqua exit & currit usque ad mare, & in transitu quando retrahit se, fodiuntur Rubiae, & adamantes, & margaritse, & aliae gemmae pretiosae : unde opinio est quod rex ille magis abundat lapidibus pretiosis, quam aliquis in mundo. In contrata ilia sunt quasi omnia genera animalium & avium ; & dixerunt mihi gentes illae, quod animalia invadunt, nee offendunt, sed ilia nullum tantum homines ilia insula aves ita magnas sicut sunt hie anseres, habentes duo capita, & alia mirabilia quae non scribo. Ultra versus transivi, & applicui ad insulam quandam meridiem illius regionis. Vidi forensem in in lingua nostra. In ea morantur pessimi homines, qui comedunt carnes crudas, & omnem immunditiam faciunt quag quasi excogitari non poterit ; nam pater comedit filium, & filius patrem, & maritus uxorem, & e contrario, & hoc per hunc modum : si pater alicujus infirmetur, filius vadit ad Astrologum sacerdotem, scz. rogans eum qu6d consulat Deum suum, si pater de tali infirmitate evadet, vel non. Tune ambo vadunt ad idolum aureum, vel argenteum, facientes orationes in hac forma. Domine, tu es Deus noster, te adoramus, & rogamus ut nobis respondeas, debetnfe talis a tali infirmitate mori vel liberari ? Tune Daemon respondet, & si dicat, vivet, filius vadit & ministrat illi usque ad plenam convalescentiam : Si autem dicat, morietur, Sacerdos ibit ad eum, & unum pannum super os ejus 390 Bodin Insula. quae vocatur Bodin, quod idem est quod [II. i. 47.] ponet, & sufFocabit eum, & ipsum mortuum incidet in frusta, & invitabuntur omnes amici, & parentes ejus ad comedendum eum cum canticis, & omni laetitia, ossa tamen ejus honorifice sepelient. Cum autem ego eos de tali ritu reprehendi, quaerens causam : Respondit unus mihi, hoc facimus ne vermes carnes ejus comedant, tune ejus anima magnam poenam sustineret, nee poteram evellere eos ab isto errore: & multae aliae novitates sunt ibi, quas non crederent, nisi qui viderent. Ego autem coram Deo nihil hie refero, nisi illud de quo certus sum sicut homo certificari poterit. De ista insula inquisivi a multis expertis, qui omnes uno ore responderunt mihi, dicentes, quod ista India 4400. insulas continet sub se, sive in se, in qua etiam sunt 64. reges coronati, & etiam dicunt quod major pars illius insulae bene inhabitatur. Et hie istius Indiae facio finem. De India superiori, & de Provincia Manci. IN primis refero, quod cum transirem per mare Oceanum per multas dietas versus Orientem, perveni ad illam magnam provinciam Manci, quae India vocatur a Latinis. De ista India superiori inquisivi a Christianis, Saracenis, idolatris, & omnibus, qui officiales sunt domini Canis magni, qui omnes uno ore responderunt, quod hsec provincia Manci habet plusquam 2000. magnarum civitatum, & in ipsa est maxima copia omnium victualium, puta, panis, vini, risi, carnium, piscium, &c. Omnes homines istius provinciae sunt artifices & mercatores, qui pro quacunque penuria, dummodo propriis manibus juvare se possent per labores, nunquam ab aliquo eleemosynam peterent. Viri istius provinciae sunt satis formosi, sed pallidi, & rasas & parvas barbas habentes ; foeminae vero sunt pulcherrimae inter omnes de mundo. Prima civitas ad quam veni de ista India vocatur Ceus- Vel Ceuscala. kalon, & distat a mari per unam dietam, positaque est super flumen, cujus aqua prope mare cui contignatur, ascendit super terram per 12. dietas. Totus populus Ista autem civitas tantum navigium In hac civitate vidi quod 300. librae de bono & recenti zinzibero habentur pro minori quam pro uno grosso : Ibi sunt anseres grossiores & pulchriores, & majus forum de Hisuntaka- illis, quam sit in mundo, ut credo, & sunt albissimi trarsi vel ono- s i c ut iaCj & habent unum os super caput quantitatis ovi, cratoh. j ^^ ^ c o l o r em sanguineum, sub gula habent unam pellem pendentem semipedalem : Pinguissimi sunt, & optimi fori : & ita est de anatibus, & gallinis, quae magnae sunt valde in ilia terra plusquam duae de nostris. Ibi sunt serpentes maximi, & capiuntur & a gente ilia comeduntur : unde qui faceret festum solemne, & non daret serpentes, nihil reputaret se facere : breviter in hac in maxima abundantia. civitate sunt omnia victualia Inde transivi per civitates multas, & veni ad civitatem Vel Zaiton, nomine Kaitan, in qua fratres Minores habent duo loca, ad quae portavi de ossibus fratrum nostrorum pro fide Christi interfectorum, de quibus supra. In hac est copia omnium victualium pro levissimo foro, haec civitas ita magna est, sicut bis Bononia, & in ea multa monasteria religiosorum, qui omnes idolis serviunt. In uno autem istorum monasteriorum ego fui, & dictum est mihi quod inerant 3000. religiosorum habentium 11000. idolorum, & unum illorum, quod quasi parvum inter caetera mihi videbatur, est ita magnum sicut Christophorus noster. Isti religiosi omni die pascunt Deos suos, unde semel ivi ad videndum comestionem illam, & vidi quod ilia quae detulerunt sibi comestibilia sunt, & calidissima, & multum fumigantia, ita quod fumus ascendit ad idola, & dixerunt Deos illo famo recreari. Totum autem cibum illi reportaverunt & comederunt, & sic de fumo tantum Deos suos paverunt. De Civitate Fuko. r „. ULtra versus Orientem veni ad civitatem quae vocatur Fuko, cujus circuitus continet 30. milliaria, in qua sunt Galli maximi & pulcherrimi, & gallinae omnes ita albae sicut nix, lanam solum pro pennis habentes sicut transversum illius flumen. intravi civitatem unam, quae pecudes. Haec civitas pulcherrima est, & sita supra mare. Ultra ivi per 18. dietas, & pertransii multas terras 8c civitates, & in transitu veni ad quendam montem magnum, & vidi quod in uno latere montis omnia animalia erant nigra ut carbo, & homines & mulieres diversum modum vivendi habent: ab alio autem latere omnia animalia erant alba sicut nix, & homines totaliter diverse Ibi omnes foeminae quae sunt desponab aliis vixerunt. in signum quod habent maritos unum satae portant Inde transivi per magnum barile de cornu in capite. 18. dietas alias, & veni ad quoddam magnum flumen, Magnum & fluminis habet pontem maximum, & hospitabar in domo unius hospitarii, qui volens mihi complacere, dixit mihi : [II. i. 48.] si velis videre piscari, veni mecum ; & duxit me super pontem, & vidi in brachiis suis mergos ligatos super perticas, ad quorum gulam ubi ille ligavit unum filum, ne illi capientes pisces, comederent eos : Postea in brachio uno posuit 3. cistas magnas, & tune dissolvit mergos de perticis, qui statim in aquam intraverunt, & pisces ceperunt, & cistas illas repleverunt in parva hora, quibus repletis vir ille dissolvit fila a collis eorum, & ipsi reintrantes flumen se de piscibus recreaverunt, & recreati ad perticas redierunt, & se ligari sicut prius permiserunt : Ego autem de illis piscibus comedi, & optimi mihi videbantur. Inde transiens per multas dietas veni ad unam civitatem quae vocatur * Kanasia, quae sonat in lingua AR&s Cansai, nostra civitas coeli : Nunquam ita magnam civitatem vidi, ve^ Quinza^ Circuitus enim ejus continet 100. milliaria, nee in ea vidi spatium quin bene inhabitaretur ; Imo vidi multas domus habentes 10. vel 12. solaria unum supra aliud : haec habet suburbia maxima continentia majorem populum quam ipsa civitas contineat. 12. portas habet principales, & in via de qualibet illarum portarum ad 8. milliaria sunt civitates forte majores ut aestimo, quam est civitas Venetiarum, & Padua. Haec civitas sita est in aquis quae semper stant, & nee fluunt, nee refluunt, vallum tamen habet propter ventum sicut civitas Venetiarum. In ea sunt plus decem mille & 2. pontium, quorum multos numeravi & transivi, & in quolibet ponte stant custodes civitatis continue custodientes civitatem pro magno Cane imperatore Catai. Unum mandatum dicunt gentes illius civitatis a domino se recepisse. Nam quilibet ignis solvit unum balis, i. 5. cartas bombicis, qui unum florenum cum dimidio valent, & 10. vel 12. supellectiles facient unum ignem, & sic pro uno igne solvent. Isti ignes sunt bene 85. Thuman, cum aliis 4. Saracenorum quae faciunt 89. Thuma vero unum decem milia ignium facit, reliqui autem de populo civitatis sunt alii Christiani, alii mercatores, & alii transeuntes per terram, unde maxime fui miratus quo modo tot corpora hominum poterant simul habitare : In ea est maxima copia victualium, scz. panis & vini, & carnium de porco praecipue cum aliis necessariis. De monasterio ubi sunt multa animalia diversa in quodam monte. IN ilia civitate 4 fratres nostri converterant unum potentem ad fidem Christi, in cujus hospitio continue habitabam, dum fui ibi, qui semel dixit mihi, Ara, i. pater, vis tu venire & videre civitatem istam ; & dixi quod sic, & ascendimus unam barcham, & ivimus ad unum monasterium maximum, de quo vocavit unum religiosum sibi notum, & dixit sibi de me. Iste Raban Francus, i. religiosus venit de inde ubi sol occidit, & nunc vadit Cambaleth, ut deprecetur vitam pro magno Cane, & ideo ostendas sibi aliquid, quod si revertatur ad contratas suas possit referre quod tale quid novum vidi in Canasia civitate : tune sumpsit ille religiosus duos mastellos magnos repletos reliquiis quae supererant de mensa, & duxit me ad unam perclusam parvam, quam aperuit cum clave, & aparuit viridarium gratiosum & magnum in quod intravimus, & in illo viridario stat unus monticulus sicut unum campanile, repletus amoenis herbis & arboribus, & dum staremus ibi, ipse sumpsit cymbalum, & incoepit percutere ipsum sicut percutitur FRIAR BEATUS ODORICUS quand6 monachi intrant refectorium, ad cujus sonitum multa animalia diversa descenderunt de monte illo, aliqua ut simiae, aliqua ut Cati, Maymones, & aliqua faciem hominis habentia, & dum sic starem congregaverunt se circa ipsum, 4000. de illis animalibus, & se in ordinibus collocaverunt, coram quibus posuit paropsidem & dabat eis comedere, & cum comedissent iterum cymbalum percussit, & omnia ad loca propria redierunt. Tune admiratus inquisivi quae essent animalia ista ? Et respondit mihi quod sunt animae nobilium virorum, quas nos hie pascimus amore Dei, qui regit orbem, & sicut unus homo fuit nobilis, ita anima ejus post mortem in corpus nobilis animalis intrat. Animae ver6 simplicium Pythagprica & rusticorum, corpora vilium animalium intrant. istam abusionem improbare, sed nihil valuit sibi, non enim poterat credere, quod aliqua anima posset sine corpore manere. Inde transivi ad quandam civitatem nomine Chilenso, cujus muri per 40. milliaria circuerunt. Chilenso. In ista civitate sunt 360. pontes lapidei pulchriores quam unquam viderim, & bene inhabitatur, & navigium maximum habet, & copiam omnium victualium, & aliorum bonorum. quod ubi est strictius habet in latitudine 7. milliaria, & illud flumen per medium terrae Pygmaeorum transit, quorum civitas vocatur Kakam, quae de pulchrioribus Kakam. civitatibus mundi est. Isti Pigmaei habent longitudinem trium spansarum mearum, & faciunt majora & meliora goton, & bombicinam quam aliqui homines in mundo. Inde per illud flumen transiens, veni ad unam civitatem Janzu, in qua est unus locus fratrum nostrorum, & sunt in ea tres ecclesiae Nestorianorum : haec civitas nobilis est, & magna, habens in se 48. Thuman ignium, & in ea omnia victualia, & animalia in magna copia, de quo Christiani vivunt: Dominus istius civitatis solum de sale habet in redditibus 50. Thuman Balisi, & valet balisus unum florenum cum dimidio: Ita quod unum Thuman facit 15. millia florenorum, unam tamen gratiam facit dominus populo, quia dimittit ei, ne sit caristia in 395 Montu. eo, 200. Thuman. Habet haec civitas consuetudinem, quod quando unus vult facere convivium amicis suis, ad hoc sunt hospitia deputata, & ubi ille circuit per hospites, tales amicos meos habebis, quos festabis nomine meo, & tantum in festo volo expendere, & per ilium modum melius convivant amici in pluribus hospitiis quam facerent in uno. Per 10. milliaria ab ista civitate in capite fluminis Thalay est una civitas vocata Montu, quae majus navigium habet, quam viderim toto mundo; Et omnes naves ibi sunt albae sicut nix, & in ipsis sunt hospitia, & multa alia quae nullus homo crederet nisi viderentur. in De civitate Cambaleth. I Ndfe transivi per 8. dietas per multas terras & civitates, & veni tandem per aquam dulcem ad quandam civitatem nomine Leneyn, quae est posita super flumen Caramoran. vocatum Caramoran, quod per medium Catai transit, & magnum damnum sibi infert, quando erumpit. Inde transiens per flumen versus Orientem per multas dietas & civitates, veni ad unam civitatem nomine Sumacoto, quag majorem copiam habet de serico, quam aliqua civitas in mundo; Quando enim est major caristia Serici, ibi 40. librae habentur pro minori quam pro 8. grossis. In ea est copia omnium mercimoniorum, & omnium victualium, panis, vini, carnium, piscium, & omnium Inde transivi versus Orientem per specierum electarum. multas civitates, & veni ad illam nobilem, & nominatam Cambaleth quae est civitas multum antiqua, & est in provincia Catai, & earn ceperunt Tartari: Et juxta earn fecerunt, quae ad dimidium miliare aliam civitatem vocatur Caido & haec 12. portas habet, & semper inter unam & aliam sunt duo miliaria, & medium inter illas civitates ben& inhabitatur, ita quod faciunt quasi unam civitatem; Et ambitus istarum duarum civitatum est plusquam 40. milliaria. In hac civitate magnus imperator Canis habet sedem suam principalem, & suum magnum palatium, cujus muri bene 4. milliaria continent; & infra 396 Mandevil cap- 33In palatio etiam illo est unus mons pul- familia sua. cherrimus consitus arboribus, propter quod mons viridis nominatur, & in monte palatium amoenissimum in quo communit&r Canis residet: A latere autem montis est unus lacus magnus, supra quern pons pulcherrimus est factus, & in illo lacu est magna copia anserum & anatum, & omnium avium aquaticarum ; & in silva montis copia omnium avium & ferarum silvestrium, & ideo quand6 dominus Canis vult venari non oportet eum exire palatium suum. Palatium vero principale, in quo sedes sua est, est magnum vald£, & habet interius 14. columnas aureas, & omnes muri ejus cooperti sunt pellibus rubeis quae dicuntur nobiliores pelles de mundo: Et in medio palatii est una pigna altitudinis duorum passuum, quae tota est de uno lapide pretioso nomine merdochas; & est tota circumligata auro, & in quolibet angulo ejus est unus serpens de auro qui verberat os fortissime: Habet etiam haec pigna retia de margaritis, & per istam pignam defertur potus per meatus & conductus qui in curia regis habetur; & juxta earn pendent multa vasa aurea cum quibus volentes bibere possunt. In hoc autem palatio sunt multi pavones de auro; & cum aliquis Tartarus facit festum domino suo, tune quando convivantes collidunt manus suas prae gaudio & laeticia, pavones emittunt alas suas, & expandunt caudas, & videntur tripudiare; Et hoc credo factum arte Magica, vel aliqua cautela subterranea. De gloria magni Canis. QUando autem magnus ille Imperator Canis in sede sua imperiali residet, tune a sinistro latere sedet Regina, & per unum gradum inferius duo mulieres quas ipse tenet pro se, quando non potest ad Reginam accedere: In infimo autem gradu resident omnes dominae de sua parentela. Omnes autem mulieres nuptae portant supra caput suum unum pedem hominis, longitudinis unius brachii cum dimidio; & subter ilium pedem sunt A latere vero dextro ipsius Canis residet filius ejus primogenitus, regnaturus post ipsum, & inferius ipso omnes qui sunt de sanguine regio: Ibi etiam sunt 4. scriptores scribentes omnia verba quae dicit rex; Ante cujus conspectum sunt Barones sui, & multi alii nobiles cum sua gente maxima, quorum nullus audet loqui nisi a domino licentia petatur exceptis fatuis & histrionibus, qui suum dominum consolari habent; Illi etiam nihil audent facere, nisi secundum quod Dominus voluerit eis legem imponere. Ante portam palatii sunt Barones custodientes, nb aliquis limen portae tangat. Ciim autem ille Canis voluerit facere convivium, habet secum 14000. Barones portantes circulos, & coronulas in capite, & domino suo servientes; Et quilibet portat unam vestem de auro & margaritis tot quot valent plus quam decies florenorum. Curia ejus optime ordinatur per millies denarios, centenarios, & millenarios, & taliter quod quilibet in suo ordine peragit officium sibi deputatum, nee aliquis defectus reperitur. Ego frater Odoricus fui ibi per tres annos, & multotiens in istis festis suis fui, quia nos fratres minores in sua curia habemus locum nobis deputatum, & oportet nos semper ire, & dare sibi nostram benedictionem: Et inquisivi ab illis de curia, de numero illorum qui sunt in curia domini, & responderunt mihi qu6d de histrionibus sunt bene 18. Thuman; Custodes autem canum & bestiarum, & avium sunt [II. i. 50.] 15. Thuman; Medici vero pro corpore Regis sunt 400. Christiani autem 8. & unus Saracenus. Et ego quando fui ibi, hii omnes omnia necessaria tarn ad victum, quam ad vestitum habebant de curia domini Canis. Quando autem vult equitare de una terra ad aliam, habet 4. exercitus equitum, & unus per unam dietam ipsum antecedit, secundus aliam, & tertius similiter, & quartus; ita qu6d semper ipse se tenet in medio in modum crucis; & ita omnes exercitus habent omnes dietas suas ordinatas, quod inveniunt omnia victualia parata sine defectu. Iltemet autem dominus Canis per ilium modum vadit; Sedet in curru cfim duabus rotis in quo facta est pulcherrima sella tota de lignis Aloe, & auro ornata, & margaritis maximis, & lapidibus pretiosis; & 4. Elephantes bene ordinati ducunt istum currum, quos praecedunt 4. equi altissimi optimfe cooperti. Juxta currum k lateribus sunt 4. Barones tenentes currum, ne aliquis appropinquet domino suo. Supra currum sedent duo Gerfalcones albissimi, & dum videt aves quos vult capere, dimittit Falcones volare, & capiunt eas; Et sic habet solatium suum equitando, & per jactum unius lapidis nullus audet appropinquare currui nisi populus assignatus: unde incredibile esset homini qui non vidisset de numero gentis suae, & reginae, & primogeniti Iste dominus Canis imperium suum divisit in 12. sui. partes, & una habet sub se 200. magnarum civitatum: unde ita latum & longum est suum imperium, quod ad quamcunque partem iret, satis haberes facere in sex mensibus, exceptis insulis, quae sunt bene 5000. De hospitiis paratis per totum imperium pro transeuntibus. I Ste dominus, ut transeuntes habeant omnia necessaria sua per totum suum imperium, fecit hospitia praeparari ubique per vias; in quibus sunt omnia parata quae ad victualia pertinent: Cum autem aliqua novitas oritur in imperio suo, tune si distat, ambassiatores super equos vel dromedarios festinant, & cum lassantur in cursu, pulsant cornu, & proximum hospitium parat unum similiter equum, qui quando alius venit fessus accipit literam, & currit ad hospitium, & sic per hospitia, & per diversos cursores rumor per 30. dietas, uno die naturali venit ad imperatorem; & ideo nihil ponderis potest fieri in imperio suo, quin statim scitur ab eo. Cum autem ipse Canis vult ire venatum; istum modum habet. Extra Cambaleth ad 20. dietas, est una foresta quae 6. dietas continet in ambitu; tot genera animalium & avium quod mirabile est dicere: Ad illud nemus vadit in fine trium annorum vel quatuor cum tota 399 gente, cum qua ipsum circuit, & canes intrare permittit, leones, cervos, & alia animalia qui animalia, scilicet reducunt ad unam planitiem pulcherrimam in medio nemoris, quia ex clamoribus canum maxime tremunt omnes bestiae sylvas. Tune accedit magnus Canis super tres elephantes & 5. sagittas mittit in to tarn multitudinem animalium, & post ipsum omnes Barones, & post ipsos alii de familia sua emittunt sagittas suas; & omnes sagittae sunt signatae certis signis & diversis: Tune vadit ad animalia interfecta, dimittens viva nemus reintrare ut alias habeat ex eis venationem suam, & quilibet illud animal habebit in cujus corpore invenit sagittam suam quam jaciebat. De quatuor festis quae tenet in anno Canis in curia. QUatuor magna festa in anno facit Dominus Canis, scilicet festum nativitatis, festum circumcisionis, coronationis, & desponsationis suae ; & ad ista festa convocat omnes Barones, & histriones, & omnes de parentela sua. Tune domino Cane in suo throno sedente, accedunt Barones cum circulis & coronis in capite, vestiti vario modo, quia aliqui de viridi, scilicet primi, secundi de sanguineo, & tertii de croceo, & tenent in manibus unam tabulam eburneam de dentibus Elephantum, & cinguntur cingulis aureis uno semisse latis, & stant pedibus silentium tenentes. Circa illos stant histriones cum suis instrumentis: In uno autem angulo cujusdam magni palatii resident Philosophi omnes ad certas horas, & puncta attendentes; & ciim devenitur ad punctum & horam petitam a philosopho, unus praeco clamat valenter. Inclinetis vos omnes imperatori vestro: tune omnes Barones cadunt ad terram ; & iterum clamat, Surgite omnes, & illi statim surgunt. Iterum Philosophi ad fuerit, aliud punctum attendunt, & chm perventum iterum praeco clamat; ponite digitum in aurem, & statim dicit, extrahite ipsum ; iteriim ad aliud punctum clamat, Buratate farinam: & multa alia faciunt, quae omnia dicunt certain significationem habere, quae scribere nolui, nee curavi, quia vana sunt & risu digna. Cftm autem perventum fuerit ad horam histrionum, tune Philosophi dicunt, facite festum domino, & omnes pulsant instrumenta sua, & faciunt maximum sonitum; & statim alius clamat; Taceant omnes, & omnes tacent: Tune accedunt histrionatrices ante dominum dulcit&r modulantes, quod mihi plus placuit. Tune veniunt leones, & faciunt reverentiam domino Cani ; Et tune histriones faciunt ciphos aureos plenos vino volare per a£rem, & ad ora hominum se applicare ut bibant. Haec & multa alia [II. i. 51.] mirabilia in curia illius Canis vidi, quae nullus crederet nisi videret; & ide6 dimitto ea. De alio mirabili audivi a fide dignis, quod in uno regno istius Canis in quo sunt montes Kapsei (& dicitur illud regnum Kalor) nascuntur pepones maximi, qui quando sunt maturi aperiuntur, & int&s invenitur una bestiola similis uni agnello : sicut audivi quod in mari Hybernico stant arbores supra ripam maris & portant fructum sicut essent cucurbitae, quae certo tempore cadunt in aquam & fiunt aves vocatae Bernakles, & illud est verum. De diversis Provinciis & civitatibus. DE isto imperio Katay recessi post tres annos, & transivi 50. dietas versus Occidentem ; & tandem veni ad terram Pretegoani, cujus ci vitas principalis Kosan vocatur, quae multas habet sub se civitates. Ultra per multas dietas ivi, & perveni ad unam provinciam vocatam Kasan ; & haec est secunda melior provincia mundi, ut Casan. dicitur, & est optime habitata : Sic quod quando exitur a porta unius civitatis, videntur portae alterius civitatis, sicut egomet vidi de multis. Latitudo Provincial est 50. dietarum, & longitudo plusquam 60. In ea est maxima copia omnium victualium, & maximfe castaneorum ; & hasc est una de 12. provinciis magni Canis.

In ista contrata nullus audet efFundere sanguinem hominis, Idoli. nee alicujus animalis, ob In ista civitate moratur Abassi 1. Papa eorum, qui est caput & princeps omnium Idolatrarum ; quibus dat & distribuit beneficia secundum morem eorum ; sicut noster Papa Romanus est caput omnium Christianorum. Foeminae in hoc regno portant plusquam centum tricas, & habent duos dentes in ore ita longos sicut apri. Quando etiam pater alicujus moritur, tune filius convocat omnes sacerdotes & histriones, & dicit se velle patrem suum honorare, & facit eum ad campum duci sequentibus parentibus omnibus, amicis, & vicinis, ubi sacerdotes cum magna solemnitate amputant caput suum, dantes illud filio suo, & tune totum corpus in frusta concidunt, & ibi dimittunt, cum orationibus cum eo redeuntes ; Tune veniunt vultures, de monte assuefacti ad hujusmodi, & Eadem his- carnes omnes asportant: Et ex tune currit fama de eo toria de eodem q ^j sanctus est, quia angeli domini ipsum portant in Guiliehnum Paradisum: Et iste est maximus honor, quern reputat deRubrhis. filius posse fieri patri suo mortuo: Tune filius sumit caput patris, & coquit ipsum, & comedit, de testa ejus faciens ciphum in quo ipse cum omnibus de domo & cognatione ejus bibunt cum solemnitate & laetitia in memoriam patris comesti. Et multa vilia & abominabilia facit gens ilia quae non scribo, quia non valent, nee homines crederent nisi viderent. De divite qui pascitur a 50. Virginibus. DUm fui in provincia Manzi transivi juxta palatium unius hominis popularis, qui habuit 50. domicellas virgines sibi continue ministrantes, in omnibus pascentes eum sicut avis aviculas, & habet semper 5. fercula triplicata; & quando pascunt eum, continue cantant dulcissime: Iste habet in redditibus Tagaris risi 30. Thuman, quorum quodlibet decies millies facit: unum autem Tagar pondus est asini. Palatium suum quo milliaria tenet in ambitu; cujus pavimentum semper unum laterem habet aureum, alium argenteum: Juxta ambitum istius palatii est unus monticulus artificialis de auro & argento, super quo stant Monasteria, & campanilia, & alia delectabilia pro solatio illius popularis; Et dictum fuit mihi, qu6d quatuor tales homines sunt in regno illo. Nobilitas virorum est longos habere ungues in digitis, praecipue poUicis quibus circueunt sibi manus: Nobilitas autem & pulchritudo mulierum est Mulierum parvos habere pedes: Et ideo matres quando filiae suae p^rvtPe^es' sunt tenellae ligant pedes earum, & non dimittunt crescere. Ultra transiens versus meridiem applicui ad quandam contratam, quae vocatur Milestorite, quae pulchra est Mikstorite. valde & fertilis; Et in ista contrata erat unus vocatus Senex de monte, qui inter duos montes fecerat sibi unum murum circumeuntem istos montes. Infra istum murum erant fontes pulcherrimi de mundo; Et juxta fontes erant pulcherrimas virgines in maximo numero, & equi pulcherrimi, & omne illud quod ad suavitatem, & delectationem corporis fieri poterit, & ideo ilium locum Iste Senex vocant homines illius contratae Paradisum. cum viderit aliquem juvenem formosum & robustum, posuit eum in illo paradiso; Per quosdam autem conductus descendere facit vinum & lac abundanter.

Hanc gratiam habent fratres ibidem, quod citissime per virtutem nominis Christi Jesu, & in virtute illius sanguinis pretiosi, quern effudit in cruce pro salute generis humani, daemonia ab obsessis corporibus expellunt; Et quia multi ibidem sunt obsessi, ducuntur per decem dietas ad fratres ligati, qui liberati statim credunt in Christum, qui liberavit eos habentes ipsum pro Deo suo, & baptizati sunt, & idola sua, & pecorum suorum statim dant fratribus, quae sunt communiter de feltro, & de crinibus mulierum: & fratres ignem in communi loco faciunt ad quern populus confluit, ut videat Deos vicinorum suorum comburi, & fratres coram populo Idola ignem projiciunt; Et prima vice de igne exierunt; Tune fratres ignem cum aqua benedicta consperserunt, & iterum Idola in ignem projecerunt, & daemones in effigie fumi nigerrimi fugerunt, & Idola remanserunt, & combusta sunt.

Et per istum modum fratres maximam multitudinem baptizant, qui cit6 recidivant ad idola pecorum: qui fratres continuo quasi stent cum illis, & illos informent. Aliud terribile fuit quod ego vidi ibi. Nam cum irem per unam vallem, quae sita est juxta fluvium deliciarum, multa corpora mortua vidi, & in ilia valle audivi sonos musicos dulces & diversos, timui. Haec & maxime de cytharis, unde multum in tot corpora mortua vallis habet longitudinem septem, vel octo milliarium ad plus, in quam si quis intrat, moritur, & nunquam vivus potest transire per medium illius vallis, & ideo omnes de contrata declinant a latere : Et tentatus eram intrare, & videre, quid hoc esset. Tandem orans & Deo me recommendans, & cruce signans, in nomine Jesu ibi, quod intravi, & vidi nullus crederet nisi videret. In hac valle ab uno ejus latere, in uno saxo unam faciem hominis vidi, quae ita terribiliter me respexit, quod omnino credidi ibi fuisse mortuus: Sed semper hoc verbum (verbum caro factum est & habitavit in nobis) protuli, & cruce me signavi, nee propius quam per 7. passus, vel 8. accedere capiti ausus fui: Ivi autem fugiens ad aliud caput vallis, & super unum monticulum arenosum ascendi, in quo undique circumspiciens nihil vidi nisi cytharas illas, quas per se (ut mihi videbatur) pulsari & resonare mirabiliter audivi. Cum ver6 fui in cacumine montis, inveni ibi argentum in maxima quantitate, quasi fuissent squamae piscium.

UNum tantum referam de magno Cane quod vidi. Consuetudo est in partibus illis quod quando praedictus dominus per aliquam contratam transit, homines ante ostia sua accendunt ignem & apponunt aromata, ac faciunt fumum, ut dominus transiens suavem sentiat odorem, & multi obviam sibi vadunt. Dum autem ivissemus ad eum, semel veniret in Cambeleth, & fama undique divulgaretur de suo adventu, unus noster Episcopus, & aliqui nostri minores fratres & ego ivimus obviam sibi bene per duas dietas : Et dum appropinquaremus ad eum, posuimus crucem super lignum, & ego habebam mecum in manu thuribulum, & incepimus cantare alta voce dicentes : Veni creator spiritus : Et dum sic cantaremus audivit voces nostras, fecitque nos vocari, ac jussit nos ad eum accedere ; cum ut supra dictum est, nullus audeat appropinquare currui suo ad jactum lapidis, nisi vocatus, exceptis illis qui currum custodiunt. Et dum ipse deposuit galerum suum, sive capellum inestimabilis quasi valoris, [II. i. 53.] & fecit reverentiam Cruci; & statim incensum posui in thuribulo ; Episcopus noster accepit thuribulum, & thurificavit eum ; ac sibi praedictus Episcopus dedit benedictionem suam. Accedentes vero ad praedictum dominum, semper sibi aliquid offerendum deferunt ; secum illam antiquam legem observantes ; Non apparebis in conspectu meo vacuus ; Idcirco portavimus nobiscum poma, & ea sibi super unum incisorium reverenter obtulimus ; & ipse duo accepit, & de uno aliquantulum comedit : Et tune fecit nobis signum quod recederemus, ne equi venientes in aliquo nos offenderent; statimque ab eo discessimus, atque divertimus, & ivimus ad aliquos Barones per fratres nostri ordinis ad fidem conversos, qui in exercitu ejus erant, & eis obtulimus de pomis prasdictis, qui cum maximo gaudio laetari, ac si praebuissemus eis familiariter magnum munus.

Respondit, Dum eras in India novi te, tuiimque novi sanctum propositum ; Sed & tu mod6 ad conventum undfe venisti revertere, quia die sequenti decimo ex hoc mundo migrabis.

Here beginneth the journall of Frier Odoricus, one of the order of the Minorites, concerning strange the Tartars of the East. things which hee sawe among Lbeit many and sundry things are reported by divers authors concerning the fashions and conditions of this world : notwithstanding I frier Odoricus of Friuli, de portu Vahonis being desirous to travel unto the forrein and remote nations of infidels, sawe and heard great and miraculous things, which I am able truely to avouch. First of al therefore sayling from Pera by Constantinople, I Pera. Trapesunda. arrived at Trapesunda. This place is right commodiously situate, as being an haven for the Persians and Medes, and other countreis beyonde the sea. In this lande I behelde with great delight a very strange spectacle, namely a certaine man leading about with him more then foure thousande partriges. The man him[II. i. 54.] selfe walked upon the ground, and the partriges flew in the aire, which he ledde unto a certaine castle called Zavena, being three dayes journey distant from Trapesunda. The saide partriges were so tame, that when the man was desirous to lie downe and rest, they In this citie lyeth would all come flocking about him like chickens. And so hee led them unto Trapesunda, and unto the palace of the Emperour, who tooke as many of them as he pleased, and the rest the saide man carried unto the place from whence he came. the body of Athanasius, upon the gate of the citie. And then I passed on further unto Armenia major, to a The citie of certaine citie called Azaron, which had bene very rich AzaroninArin olde time, but nowe the Tartars have almost layed mema major* In the saide citie there was abundance of it waste. bread and flesh, and of all other victuals except wine and fruites. This citie also is very colde, and is reported to be higher situated, then any other city in It hath most holesome and sweete waters the world. about it: for the veines of the said waters seeme to spring and flow from the mighty river of Euphrates, which is but a dayes journey from the saide city. Also, the said citie stands directly in the way to Tauris. And I passed on unto a certaine mountaine called Sobissacalo. same mountaine whereupon the Arke of Noah rested : unto the which I would willingly have ascended, if my company would have stayed for me. Howbeit the people of that countrey report, that no man could ever ascend the said mountaine, because (say they) it pleaseth not the highest God. And I travailed on further unto Tauris that great and royal city, which was in old time Tauris a citie called Susis. This city is accompted for traffique of °fPemamarchandize the chiefe city of the world : for there is no kinde of victuals, nor any thing else belonging unto marchandize, which is not to be had there in great abundance. This city stands very commodiously: for unto it all the nations of the whole worlde in a maner may resort for traflique. Concerning the said citie, the Christians in those parts are of opinion, that the Persian Emperour receives more tribute out of it, then the King of France out of all his dominions. Neare unto the said city there is a salt-hill yeelding salt unto the city : and of 409 that salt ech man may take what pleaseth him, n ot paying In this city many Christians o u g ht to any man therefore. of all nations do inhabite, over w h om t he Saracens beare rule in all things.

M o r e o v er I with a certaine company of Caravans toward u p p er India : and in the way, after many dayes j o u r n e y, I came unto Or, Cassibin. the citie of the three wise m en called * Cassan, which is a Geste.

In this city there is abundance of all kinds of victuals, and especially of figs, reisins, and grapes; more (as I suppose) then in any part of the whole world besides. This is one of the three principall cities in all the Persian Empire. Of this city the Saracens report, that no Christian can by any meanes live therein above a yeere. Then passing many dayes journey on forward, I came unto a certaine citie called * Comum, which was an huge and mightie city in olde time, conteyning well nigh fiftie miles in circuite, and hath done in times past great damage unto the Romanes. In it there are stately palaces altogether destitute of inhabitants, notwithstanding it aboundeth with great store of victuals. From hence traveiling through many countreys, at length I came unto the land of Job named Hus, which is full of all kinde of victuals, and very pleasantly situated. Thereaboundance. Foure partriges are here solde for lesse then a groat. In this countrey there are most comely olde men. Here also the men spin and card, and not the women. This land bordereth upon the North part of Chaldaea. A.D. I33°Of the maners of the Chaldaeans, and of India. FRom thence I traveled into Chaldaea, which is a great kingdome, and I passed by the tower of Babel. This Tke tower °f region hath a language peculiar unto it selfe, and there Bahelare beautifull men, and deformed women. The men of the same countrey use to have their haire kempt, and trimmed like unto our women: and they weare golden turbants upon their heades richly set with pearle, and pretious stones. The women are clad in a course smock onely reaching to their knees, and having long sleeves hanging downe to the ground. And they goe barefooted, wearing breeches which reach to the ground also. They weare no attire upon their heads, but their haire hangs disheaveled about their eares: and there be many [II. i. 55.] other strange things also. From thence I came into the lower India, which the Tartars overran and wasted. And in this countrey the people eat dates for the most part, whereof 42. li. are there sold for lesse then a groat. I passed further also many dayes journey unto the Ocean sea, and the first land where I arrived, is called * Ormes, Ormus. being well fortified, and having great store of marchandize and treasure therein. Such and so extreme is the heat in that countrey, that the privities of men come out of their bodies and hang downe even unto their mid-legs. And therefore the inhabitants of the same place, to preserve their owne lives, do make a certaine ointment, and anointing their privie members therewith, do lap them up in certaine bags fastened unto their bodies, for otherwise they must needs die. Here also they use a kinde of Bark or shippe called Jase being compact together onely wherein I could not finde any yron at all, and in the Thana,wkere- space of 28. dayes I arrived at the city of Thana, wherein of Frederick foure of o ur F r i e rs w e re m a r t yred for the faith of Christ. Qeesarmaketh T h ig countrey mention. ; s w e ll si t u a te 5 having abundance of bread and wine, and of other victuals therein. This kingdome in olde time was very large and under the dominion of king Porus, who fought a great battel with Alexander the great. The people of this countrey are idolaters worshipping fire, serpents and trees. And over all this land the Saracens do beare rule, who tooke it by maine force, and they themselves are in subjection unto king Daldilus. There be divers kinds of beasts, as namely blacke lyons in great abundance, and apes also, and monkeis, and battes as bigge as our doves. Also there are mise as bigge as our countrey dogs, and therefore they are hunted with dogs, because cats are not able to incounter them. Moreover, in the same countrey every man hath a bundle of great boughs standing in a water-pot before his doore, which bundle is as great as a piller, and it will not wither, so long as water is applied thereunto: with many other novelties and strange things, the relation whereof would breed great delight. How peper is had: and where it groweth. MOreover, that it may be manifest how peper is had, it is to be understood that it groweth in a certaine kingdome whereat I my selfe arrived, being called * Minibar, and it is not so plentiftill in any other part of the worlde as it is there. For the wood wherein it growes conteineth in circuit 18. dayes journey. And in the said wood or forrest there are two cities, one called *Flandrina, and the other Cyncilim. In Flandrina both Jewes and Christians doe inhabite, betweene whom there is often contention and warre: howbeit the Christians overcome the Jewes at all times. In the foresaid wood pepper is had after this maner: first it groweth in leaves like unto pot-hearbs, which they plant neere unto great trees 412 Malabar. Or, Alanclusters, as our vines doe yeeld grapes, but being ripe, they are of a greene colour, and are gathered as we gather grapes, and then the graines are layed in the Sunne to be dried, and being dried are put into earthen vessels: and thus is pepper made and kept. Now, in the same wood there be many rivers, wherein are great store of Crocodiles, and of other serpents, which the inhabitants there- about do burne up with straw and with other dry fewel, and so they go to gather their pepper without danger. At the South end of the said forrest stands the city of Polumbrum, which aboundeth with marchandize of all kinds. All the inhabitants of that countrey do worship a living oxe, as their god, whom they put to labour for sixe yeres, and in the seventh yere they cause him to rest from al his worke, placing him in a solemne and publique place, and calling him an holy beast. Moreover they use this foolish ceremonie : Every morning they take two basons, either of silver, or of gold, and with one they receive the urine of the oxe, and with the other his dung. With the urine they wash their face, their eyes, and all their five senses. Of the dung they put into both their eyes, then they annoint the bals of their cheeks therewith, and thirdly their breast: and then they say that they are sanctified for all that day; And as the people doe, even so doe their King and Queene. This people worshippeth also a dead idole, which, from the navel upward, resembleth a man, and from the navel downeward an oxe. The very same Idol delivers oracles unto them, and sometimes requireth the blood of fourtie virgins for his hire. And therefore the men of that region do consecrate their daughters and their sonnes unto their idols, even as Christians do their children unto some Religion or Saint in heaven. Likewise they sacrifice their sonnes and their daughters, and so, much people is put to death before the said Idol by reason of that accursed ceremony. Also, many other hainous and abominable villanies doeth that brutish beastly people commit: and I sawe many to insert. Another most vile custome the foresaide The burning nation doeth retaine : for when any man dieth they burne of their dead. fas ^ e ad c o r p S tQ a s h es . ancj jf h;s wjfe surviveth him, her they burne quicke, because (say they) she shall accompany her husband in his tilthe and husbandry, when he is come into a new world. Howbeit the said wife having children by her husband, may if she will, remaine [II. i. 56.] still alive with them, without shame or reproch : notwithstanding, for the most part, they all of them make choice to be burnt wl their husbands. Now, albeit the wife dieth before her husband, that law bindeth not the husband to any such inconvenience, but he may mary another wife also. Likewise, ye said nation hath another strange custome, in that their women drink wine, but their men do not. Also the women have the lids & brows of their eyes & beards shaven, but the men have not : with many other base & filthy fashions which the said women do use contrary to the nature of their sexe. From that kingdom I traveiled 10. daies journey unto another kingdome called Mobar, which containeth many cities. Within a certaine church of the same countrey, the body of S. Thomas the Apostle is interred, the very same church being full of idols : and in 15. houses round about the said Church, there dwell certaine priests who are Nestorians, that is to say, false, and bad Christians, and schismatiques. Mobar, or Maliapor. Of a strange and uncouth idole : and of certaine customes and ceremonies. strang idole, being made after IN the said kingdome of Mobar there is a wonderfull the shape and resemblance of a man, as big as the image of our Christopher, & consisting all of most pure and glittering gold. And about the neck thereof hangeth a silke riband, ful of most rich & precious stones, some one of which is of more value then a whole kingdome. The house of this idol is all of beaten gold, namely the roofe, the pavement, and the sieling of the wall within and without. Unto this idol the Indians go on pilgrimage, as we do unto S. Peter. Some go with halters about their necks, some with their hands bound behind them, some other with knives sticking on their armes or legs : and if after their peregrination, the flesh of their wounded arme festereth or corrupteth, they esteeme that limme to be holy, & thinke that their God is wel pleased with them. Neare unto the temple of that idol is a lake made by the hands of men in an open & common place, whereinto the pilgrimes cast gold, silver, & precious stones, for the honour of the idol and the repairing of his temple. And therfore when any thing is to be adorned or mended, they go unto this lake taking up the treasure which was cast in. Moreover at every yerely feast of the making or repairing of the said idol, the king and queene, with the whole multitude of the people, & all the pilgrimes assemble themselves, & placing the said idol in a most stately & rich chariot, they cary him out of their temple with songs, & with all kind of musical harmonie, & a great company of virgins go procession-wise two and two in a rank singing before him. Many pilgrims also put themselves under the chariot wheeles, to the end that their false god may go over them : and al they over whom the chariot runneth, are crushed in pieces, & divided asunder in the midst, and slaine right out. Yea, & in doing this, they think themselves to die most holily & securely, in the service of their god. And by this meanes every yere, there die under the said filthy idol, mo then 500. persons, whose carkases are burned, and their ashes are kept for reliques, because they died in that sort for their god. Moreover they have another detestable ceremony. For when any man offers to die in the service of his false god, his parents, & all his friends assemble themselves together with a consort of musicians, making him a great & solemne feast: which feast being ended, they hang 5. sharpe knives about his neck carying him before the idol, & so soone as he is come thither, he taketh one of his knives crying with a loud voice, For the worship of my god do I cut this my flesh, and then he casteth the morsel which is cut, at ye face of his idol: but at the very last wound wherewith he murthereth himselfe, he utterth these words : Now do I yeeld my self to death in the behalfe of my god, and being dead, his body is burned, & is esteemed by al men to be holy. The king of the said region is most rich in gold, silver, and precious stones, & there be the fairest unions in al the world. Traveling from thence by the Ocean sea 50. daies journey southward, I came unto a certain land named Lammori, where, in regard of extreeme heat, the people both men and women go stark-naked from top to toe : who seeing me apparelled scoffed at me, saying, that God In this countrey al women made Adam & Eve naked. are common, so that no man can say, this is my wife. Also when any of the said women beareth a son or a daughter, she bestowes it upon any one that hath lien with her, whom she pleaseth. Likewise al the land of that region is possessed in common, so that there is not mine & thine, or any propriety of possession in the division of lands : howbeit every man hath his owne house peculiar unto himselfe. Mans flesh, if it be fat, is eaten as ordinarily there, as beefe in our country. And albeit the people are most lewd, yet the country is exceeding good, abounding with al commodities, as flesh, corne, rise, silver, gold, wood of aloes, Campheir, and many other things. Marchants comming unto this region for traffique do usually bring wl them fat men, selling them unto the inhabitants as we sel hogs, who In this island towards the immediatly kil & eat them. south, there is another kingdome called Simoltra, where both men and women marke themselves with red-hot yron in 12. sundry spots of their faces : and this nation in is at continual warre with certaine naked people another region. Then I traveled further unto another island called Java, the compasse whereof by sea is 3000. miles. The king of this Hand hath 7. other crowned 416 Perhaps he meaneth Comon. Sumatra. Java. kings under his jurisdiction. The said Hand is throughly inhabited, & is thought to be one of the principall Hands of ye whole world. In the same Hand there groweth great plenty of cloves, cubibez, and nutmegs, and in a word all kinds of spices are there to be had, and great abundance of all victuals except wine. The king of the said land of Java hath a most brave and sumptuous pallace, the most loftily built, that ever I saw any, & it hath most high greeses & stayers to ascend up to the roomes therin contained, one stayre being of silver, & another of gold, throughout the whole building. Also the lower roomes were paved all over with one square plate of silver, & another of gold. All the wals upon the inner side were seeled over with plates of beaten gold, wherupon were ingraven ye pictures of knights, having about their temples, ech of them a wreath of golde, adorned with precious stones. The roofe of the palace was of pure gold. With this king of Java the great Can in war : whom of Catay hath had many conflictes notwithstanding the said king hath alwayes overcome & vanquished. Of certaine trees yeelding meale, hony, and poyson. NEere unto the said Hand is another countrey called Panten, or Tathalamasin. And the king of the In same country hath many Hands under his dominion. this land there are trees yeelding meale, hony, & wine, & the most deadly poison in all ye whole world : for against it there is but one only remedy : & that is this : if any man hath taken of ye poyson, & would be delivered from the danger therof, let him temper the dung of a man in water, & so drinke a good quantitie thereof, & it expels the poyson immediatly, making it to avoid at the fundement. Meale is produced out of the said trees after this maner. They be mighty huge trees, and when they are cut with an axe by the ground, there issueth out of the stocke a certain licour like unto gumme, which they take 417 IV daies together abroad in the sun, & at the end of those 15 dayes, when the said licour is throughly parched, it becommeth meale. Then they steepe it first in sea water, washing it afterward with fresh water, and so it is made very good & savorie paste, wherof they make either meat or bread, as they thinke good. Of which bread I my selfe did eate, & it is fayrer without & somewhat A sea running browne within. By this countrey is the sea called Mare still South- mortuum, which runneth continually Southward, into ye ward' which whosoever falleth is never seene after. In this countrey also are found canes of an incredible length, namely of 60 paces high or more, & they are as bigge as trees. Other canes there be also called Cassan, which overspread the earth like grasse, & out of every knot of them spring foorth certaine branches, which are continued upon the ground almost for the space of a mile. In the sayd canes there are found certaine stones, one of which stones, whosoever carryeth about with him, cannot be wounded with any yron : & therefore the men of that countrey for the most part, carry such stones with them, whithersoever they goe. Many also cause one of the armes of their children, while they are yong, to be launced, putting one of the said stones into the wound, healing also, and closing up the said wound with the powder of a certaine fish (the name whereof I do not know) which powder doth immediatly consolidate and cure the said wound. And by the vertue of these stones, the people aforesaid doe for the most part triumph both on sea and land. Howbeit there is one kind of stratageme, which the enemies of this nation, knowing the vertue of the sayd stones, doe practise against them : namely, they provide themselves armour of yron or steele against their arrowes, & weapons also poisoned with the poyson of trees, & they carry in their hands wooden stakes most sharpe & hard-pointed, as if they were yron : likewise they shoot arrowes without yron heads, and so they confound & slay some of their unarmed foes trusting too securely unto the vertue of their stones. Also of the foresayd canes called Cassan they make sayles for their ships, and litle houses, and many Sayles made other necessaries. From thence after many dayes travel!, °freedes* I arrived at another kingdome called Campa, a most Qampa. beautiful and rich countrey, & abounding with all kind of victuals : the king wherof, at my being there, had so many wives & concubines, that he had 300 sonnes & daughters by them. This king hath 10004 tame Elephants, which are kept even as we keepe droves of oxen, or flocks of sheepe in pasture. Of the abundance of fishes, which cast themselves upon the shore. IN this countrey there is one strange thing to be observed, yl every several kind of fishes in those seas come swimming towards the said countrey in such abundance, that, for a great distance into the sea, nothing can be seene but ye backs of fishes : which, casting themselves upon the shore when they come neere unto it, do suffer men, for the space of 3. daies, to come & to take as many of them as they please, & then they returne againe unto the sea. After that kind of fishes comes another kind, offering it selfe after the same maner, and so in like sort all other kinds whatsoever : notwithstanding they do this but once in a yere. And I demaunded of the inhabitants there, how, or by what meanes this strange accident could come to passe ? They answered, that fishes were taught, even by nature, to come & to do homage unto their, Emperour. There be Tortoises also as bigge as an oven. Many other Tortoises. things I saw which are incredible, unlesse a man should *• lm *8'J see them with his own eies. In this country also dead men are burned, & their wives are burned alive with them, as in the city of Polumbrum above mentioned : for the men of that country say that she goeth to accompany him in another world, that he should take none other wife in mariage. Moreover I traveled on further by the ocean-sea towards the south, & passed through many countries and islands, wherot one is Moumoran. called Moumoran, & it containeth in compasse ii. M. miles, wherin men & women have dogs faces, and worship an oxe for their god : and therefore every one of them cary the image of an oxe of gold or silver upon their foreheads. The men and the women of this country go all naked, saving that they hang a linen cloth before their privities. The men of the said country are very tall and mighty, and by reason that they goe naked, when they are to make battell, they cary yron or steele-targets before them, which do cover and defend their bodies from top to toe : and whomsoever of their foes they take in battel not being able to ransom himselfe for money, they presently devoure him : but if he be able to redeeme himselfe for money, they let him go free. Their king weareth about his necke 300. great and most beautifull unions, and saith every day 300* prayers unto his god. He weareth upon his finger also a stone of a span long, which seemeth to be a flame of fire, and therefore when he weareth it, no man dare once approch unto him : and they say that there is not any stone in the whole world of more value then it. Neither could at any time the great Tartarian Emperour of Katay either by force, money, or policie obtaine it at his hands : notwithstanding that he hath done the utmost of his indevour for this purpose. Of the island of Sylan : and of the mountaine where Adam mourned for his sonne Abel. I Passed also by another island called Sylan, which conteineth in compasse above ii. M. miles : wherin are an infinit number of serpents, & great store of lions, beares, & al kinds of ravening & wild beasts, and In the said country there is an especially of elephants. huge mountaine, whereupon the that region do report that Adam mourned for his son Abel In the midst of this mountain ye space of 500. yeres. inhabitants of there is a most beautiful plain, wherin is a litle lake conteining great plenty of water, which water ye inhabitants report to have proceeded from the teares of Adam & Eve : howbeit I proved that to be false, because I saw the water flow in the lake. This water is ful of hors-leeches, & blood-suckers, & of precious stones also : which precious stones the king taketh not unto his owne use, but once or twise every yere he permitteth certaine poore people to dive under the water for ye said stones, & al that they can get he bestoweth upon them, to the end they may pray for his soule. But y* they may with lesse danger dive under the water, they take limons which they pil, anointing themselves throughly with the juice therof, & so they may dive naked under ye water, the hors-leeches not being able to hurt them. From this lake the water runneth even unto the sea, and at a low ebbe the inhabitants dig rubies, diamonds, pearls, & other pretious stones out of the shore : wherupon it is thought, that ye king of this island hath greater abundance of pretious stones, then any other monarch in the whole earth besids. In the said country there be al kinds of beasts and foules : & the people told me, that those beasts would not invade nor hurt any stranger, but only the natural inhabitants. I saw in this island fouls as big as our country geese, having two heads, and other miraculous things, which I will toward the not here write off. Traveling on further south, I arrived at a certain island called Bodin, which Or.Dadin. signifieth in our language unclean. In this island there do inhabit most wicked persons, who devour & eat raw flesh committing al kinds of uncleannes & abominations in such sort, as it is incredible. For the father eateth his son, & the son his father, the husband his owne wife, & the wife her husband : and that after this maner. If any mans father be sick, the son straight goes unto the sooth-saying or prognosticating priest, requesting him to demand of his god, whether his father shall recover of that infirmity or no ? Then both of them their praiers unto it in maner folowing : Lord, thou art our god, & thee we do adore, beseeching thee to resolve us, whether such a man must die, or recover of such an infirmity or no ? Then the divel answereth out of idol : if he saith (he shal live) then reye foresaid turneth his son and ministreth things necessary unto him, til he hath attained unto his former health : but if he saith (he shal die) then goes ye priest unto him, & putting a cloth into his mouth doth strangle him therewith : which being done, he cuts his dead body into morsels, & al his friends and kinsfolks are invited unto the eating thereof, with musique and all kinde of mirth : howbeit his bones are solemnely buried. And when I found fault with that custome demanding a reason thereof, one of them gave me this answere : this we doe, least the wormes should eat his flesh, for then his soule should suffer great torments, neither could I by any meanes remoove them from that errour. Many other novelties and strange things there bee in this countrey, which no man would credite, unles he saw them with his owne eyes. Howbeit, I (before almighty [II. i. 59.] God) do here make relation of nothing but of that only, whereof I am as sure, as a man may be sure. Concerning the foresaid islands I inquired of divers wel- experienced persons, who al of them, as it were with this India one consent, answered me saying, That contained 4400. islands under it, or within it : in which islands there are sixtie and foure crowned kings : and they say moreover, that the greater part of those islands are wel inhabited. And here I conclude concerning that part of India. Or, China. Of the upper India : and of the province of Mancy. First of al therefore, having traveled many dayes journey upon the Ocean-sea toward the East, at length I arrived at a certaine great province called India I inquired of Christians, of Saracens, & of Idolaters, and of al such as bare any office under the great Can. Who all of them with one consent answered, that this province of Mancy hath mo then 2000. great cities within the precincts thereof, & that it aboundeth with all plenty of victuals, as namely with bread, wine, rise, flesh, and fish. All the men of this province be artificers & marchants, who, though they be in never so extreme penurie, so long as they can helpe themselves by the labor of their hands, wil never beg almes of any man. The men of this province are of a faire and comely personage, but somewhat pale, having their heads shaven but a litle: but the women are the most beautiful under the sunne. The first city of ye said India which I came unto, is called Ceuskalon, which Or, Ceuskala. being a daies journey distant from the sea, stands upon a river, the water whereof, nere unto the mouth, where it exonerateth it selfe into the sea, doth overflow the land for the space of 12. daies journey. All the inhabitants of this India are worshippers of idols. The foresaid city of Ceuskalon hath such an huge navy belonging thereunto, that no man would beleeve it unlesse he should see it. In this city I saw 300.H. of good & new ginger sold for lesse then a groat. There are the He meaneth greatest, and the fairest geese, & most plenty of them to Pej^cans^ Y T be sold in al the whole world, as I suppose : they are as Spaniards col white as milke, and have a bone upon the crowne of their Akatrarzi. heads as bigge as an egge, being of the colour of blood : under their throat they have a skin or bag hanging downe halfe a foot. They are exceeding fat & wel sold. Also they have ducks and hens in that country, one as big as two of ours. There be monstrous great serpents likewise, which are taken by the inhabitants & eaten : where- upon a solemne feast among them without serpents is nought set by : and to be briefe, in this city there are al kinds of victuals in great abundance. From thence I passed by many cities & at length I came unto a city 423 wktch the i 1 1 J 11 11 1 t . Or, Zaiton. named Caitan, wherin ye friers Minorites have two places of aboad, unto the which I transported the bones of the dead friers, which suffred martyrdom for the faith of Christ, as it is above mentioned. In this city there is abundance of al kind of victuals very cheap. The said city is as big as two of Bononia, & in it are many monasteries of religious persons, al which do worship idols. I my selfe was in one of those Monasteries, & it was told me, that there were in it iii. M. religious men, having xi. M. idols : and one of ye said idols which seemed unto me but litle in regard of the rest, was as big as our Christopher. These religious men every day do feed their idol-gods : wherupon at a certaine time I went to behold the banquet : and indeed those things which they brought unto them were good to eat, & fuming hote, insomuch that the steame of the smoke thereof ascended up unto their idols, & they said that their gods were refreshed with the smoke : howbeit all the meat they conveyed away, eating it up their owne selves, and so they fed their dumb gods with the smoke onely. Of the citie Fuco. TRaveling more eastward, I came unto a city named Fuco, which conteineth 30. miles in circuit, wherin be exceeding great & faire cocks, and al their hens are as white as the very snow, having wol in stead of feathers, It is a most stately & beautiful city & like unto sheep. standeth upon the sea. Then I went 18. daies journey on further, & passed by many provinces & cities, and in the way I went over a certain great mountaine, upon ye one side whereof I beheld al living creatures to be as black as a cole, & the men and women on that side differed somwhat in maner of living from others : howbeit, on the other side of the said hil every living thing was snow-white, & the inhabitants in their maner of living, were altogether unlike unto others. There, all maried women cary in token that they have husbands, a great trunke of home upon their heads. From thence I unto belongeth a mighty bridge to passe the said river. And mine hoste with whom I sojourned, being desirous to shew me some sport, said unto me : Sir, if you will see any fish taken, goe with me. Then hee led me unto the foresaid bridge, carying in his armes with him certaine dive-doppers or water-foules, bound unto a company of poles, and about every one of their necks he tied a threed, least they should eat the fish as fast as they tooke them : and he caried 3. great baskets with him also : then loosed he the dive-doppers from the poles, which presently went into the water, & within lesse then the space of one houre, caught as many fishes as filled the 3. baskets : which being full, mine hoste untyed the threeds from about their neckes, and entering the second time into the river they fed themselves with fish, and being satisfied they returned and suffered themselves to be bound unto the saide poles as they were before. And when I did eate of those fishes, me thought they were exceeding good. Travailing thence many dayes journeys, at length I arrived at another city called * Canasia, which signifieth in our language, the city of heaven. Never in all my life did I see so great a citie ; for it conteineth in circuit an hundreth miles : neither sawe I any plot thereof, which was not throughly inhabited : yea, I sawe many houses of tenne or twelve stories high, one above another. It hath mightie large suburbs containing more people then the citie it selfe. Also it hath twelve principall gates : and about the distance of eight miles, in the high way unto every one of the saide gates standeth a city as big by estimation as Venice, and Padua. The foresaid city of Canasia is situated in waters or marshes, which alwayes stand still neither ebbing nor flowing : howbeit it hath a defence for the winde like unto Venice. In this citie there are mo then 10002. bridges, many whereof I numbred and passed over them : and upon every of those bridges stand certaine watch425 A.D. I33OA great river. Foules catching fish. [II. i. 60.] Or Cansai, or Quinzai. The Italian copy in Ramusius, hath 11000. men of the citie, keeping continuall watch and ward about the said city, for the great Can the Emperour of Catay. The people of this countrey say, that they have one duetie injoyned unto them by their lord : for every fire payeth one Balis in regard of tribute : and a Balis is five papers or pieces of silke, which are worth one floren and an halfe of our coine. Tenne or twelve housholds are accompted for one fire, and so pay tribute but for one fire onely. Al those tributary fires amount unto the number of 85. Thuman, with other foure Thuman of the Saracens, which make 89. in al ; And one Thuman consisteth 10000. fires. The residue of the people of the city are some of them Christians, some marchants, and some traveilers through the countrey : whereupon I marveiled much howe such an infinite number of persons could inhabite and live together. There is great aboundance of victuals in this citie, as namely of bread and wine, and especially of hogs-flesh, with other necessaries. Of a Monastery where many strange beastes of divers kindes doe live upon an hill. IN the foresaide citie foure of our friers had converted a mighty and riche man unto the faith of Christ, at whose house I continually abode, for so long time as I remained in the citie. Who upon a certaine time saide unto me : Ara, that is to say, Father, will you goe and beholde the citie ? And I said, yea. Then embarqued we our selves, and directed our course unto a certaine great Monastery : where being arrived, he called a religious person with whom he was acquainted, saying unto him concerning me : this Raban Francus, that is to say, this religious Frenchman commeth from the Westerne parts of the world, and is now going to the city of Cambaleth to pray for the life of the great Can, and therefore you must shew him some rare thing, that when hee returnes into his owne countrey, he may say, this strange sight or novelty have I seene in the city of Canasia. Then the said religious man tooke two great baskets full of broken reliques which remained of the table, and led me unto a little walled parke, the doore whereof he unlocked with his key, and there appeared unto us a pleasant faire greene plot, into the which we entred. In the said greene stands a litle mount in forme of a steeple, replenished with fragrant herbes, and fine shady trees. And while we stood there, he tooke a cymball or bell, and rang therewith, as they use to ring to dinner or bevoir in cloisters, at the sound whereof many creatures of divers kinds came downe from the mount, some like apes, some like cats, some like monkeys ; and some having faces like men. And while I stood beholding of them, they gathered themselves together about him, to the number of 4200. of those creatures, putting themselves in good order, before whom he set a platter, and gave them the said fragments to eate. And when they had eaten he rang upon his cymbal the second time, and they al returned unto their former places. Then, wondring greatly at the matter, I demanded what kind of creatures those might be ? They are (quoth he) the soules of noble men which we do here feed, for the love of God who governeth the world : and as a man was honorable or noble in this life, so his soule after death, entreth into the body of some excellent beast or other, but the soules of simple and rusticall people do possesse the bodies of more vile and brutish creatures. Then I began to refute that foule error : howbeit my speach did nothing at all prevaile with him : for hee could not be perswaded that any soule might remaine without a body. From thence I departed unto a certaine citie named Chilenso, the walls whereof conteined 40. miles in cir- Chilenso. cuit. In this city there are 360. bridges of stone, the fairest that ever I saw : and it is wel inhabited, having a great navie belonging thereunto, & abounding with all kinds of victuals and other commodities. And thence I went unto a certaine river called Thalay, which, where it Tkalay. is most narrow, is 7. miles broad : and it runneth through the midst of the land of Pygmaei, whose chiefe city is Cakam. called Cakam, and is one of the goodliest cities in the [II. i. 61.] world. These Pigm^ans are three of my spans highland they make larger and better cloth of cotten and silke, then any other nation under the sunne. And coasting along by the saide river, I came unto a certaine citie named Janzu, in which citie there is one receptacle for the Friers of our order, and there be also three Churches of the Nestorians. This Janzu is a noble and great citie, containing 48 Thuman of tributarie fiers, and in it are all kindes of victuals, and great plenty of such beastes, foules and fishes, as Christians doe usually live upon. The lord of the same citie hath in yeerely revenues for salt onely, fiftie Thuman of Balis, and one balis is worth a floren and a halfe of our coyne: insomuch that one Thuman of balis amounteth unto the value of fifteene thousand florens. Howbeit the sayd lord favoureth his people in one respect, for sometimes he forgiveth them freely two hundred Thuman, least there should be any scarcity or dearth among them. There is a custome in this citie, that when any man is determined to banquet his friends, going about unto certaine tavernes or cookes houses appointed for the same purpose, he sayth unto every particular hoste, you shall have such, and such of my friendes, whom you must intertaine in my name, and so much I will bestowe upon the banquet. And by that meanes his friendes are better feasted at diverse places, then they should have beene at one. Tenne miles from the sayde citie, about the head of the foresayd river of Thalay, there is a certaine other citie called Montu, which hath the greatest navy that I saw in the whole world. All their ships are as white as snow, and they have banqueting houses in them, and many other rare things also, which no man would beleeve, unlesse he had seene them with his owne eyes. 1330TRaveiling eight dayes journey further by divers territories and cities, at length I came by fresh water unto a certaine citie named Leneyn, standing upon the river of *Karavoran, which runneth through the midst Karamorm. of Cataie, and doeth great harme in the countrey when it overfloweth the bankes, or breaketh foorth of the chanell. From thence passing along the river Eastward, after many dayes travell, and the sight of divers cities, I arrived at a citie called *Sumakoto, which aboundeth Sumacoto. more with silke then any other citie in the world: for when there is great scarcitie of silke, fortie pound is sold In this citie there is abundfor lesse then eight groates. ance of all merchandize, and of all kindes of victuals also, as of bread, wine, flesh, fish, with all choise and delicate spices. Then traveiling on still towards the East by many cities, I came unto the noble and renowmed citie of Cambaleth, which is of great antiquitie, being situate in the province of Cataie. This citie the Tartars tooke, and neere unto it within the space of halfe a mile, they built another citie called Caido. The citie of Caido hath twelve gates, being each of them two miles distant from another. Also the midst betweene is very well and throughly inhabited, so that they make as it were but one citie betweene them both. The whole compasse or circuit of both cities together, is 40. miles. In this citie the great emperour Can hath his principall seat, and his Imperiall palace, the wals of which palace containe foure miles in circuit: and neere unto this his palace are many other palaces and houses of his nobles which belong unto his court. Within the precincts of the sayd palace Imperiall, there is a most beautifull mount, set and replenished with trees, for which cause it is called the Greene mount, having a most royall and sumptuous palace standing thereupon, in which, for the most part, the great Can is resident. Upon the one side of the 429 two foresayd cities the space lying the stately bridge is built, in which lake is great abundance of geese, ducks, and all kindes of water foules: and in the wood growing upon the mount there is great store of all birds, and wilde beasts. And therefore when the great Can will solace himselfe with hunting or hauking, he needs not so much as once to step forth of his palace. Moreover, the principall palace, wherein he maketh his abode, is very large, having within it 14 pillers of golde, and all the walles thereof are hanged with red skinnes, which are sayd to be the most costly skinnes in all the world. In the midst of the palace standes a cisterne of two yards high, which consisteth of a pretious stone called Merdochas, and is wreathed about with golde, & at ech corner thereof is the golden image of a serpent, as it were, furiously shaking and casting forth his head. This cisterne also hath a kind of networke of pearle wrought about it. Likewise by the sayd cisterne there is drinke conveyed thorow certeine pipes and conducts, such as useth to be drunke in the emperors court, upon the which also there hang many vessels of golde, wherein, whosoever will may drinke of the sayd licour. In the foresayd palace there are many peacocks of golde: & when any Tartar maketh a banquet unto his lord, if the guests chance to clap their hands for joy and mirth, the sayd golden peacocks also will spread abroad their wings, and lift up their traines, seeming as if they danced: and this I suppose to be done by arte magike or by some secret engine under the ground. M< [II. i. 62.] Of the glory and magnificence of the great Can. rOreover, when the great emperor Can sitteth in . his imperiall throne of estate, on his left hand sitteth his queene or empresse, and upon another inferior seate there sit two other women, which are to accompany the emperor, when his spouse is absent, but in the lowest place of all, there sit all the ladies of his kinred. All the maried women weare upon their heads a kind of ornaa halfe in length, and the lower part of the sayd foote is adorned with cranes feathers, and is all over thicke set with great and orient pearles. Upon the right hand of the great Can sitteth his first begotten sonne and heire apparant unto his empire, and under him sit all the nobles of the blood royall. There bee also foure Secretaries, which put all things in writing that the emperor speaketh. In whose presence likewise stand his Barons and divers others of his nobilitie, with great traines of folowers after them, of whom none dare speake so much as one word, unlesse they have obtained licence of the emperor so to doe, except his jesters and stage-players, who are appointed of purpose to solace their lord. Neither yet dare they attempt to doe ought, but onely according to the pleasure of their emperor, and as hee enjoineth them by lawe. About the palace gate stand certaine Barons to keepe all men from treading upon the threshold of the sayd gate. When it pleaseth the great Can to solemnize a feast, he hath about him 14000. Barons, carying wreathes & litle crownes upon their heads, and giving attendance upon their lord, and every one of them weareth a garment of gold and precious stones, which is woorth ten thousand Florens. His court is kept in very good order, by governours of tens, governours of hundreds, and governours of thousands, insomuch that every one in his place performeth his duetie committed unto him, neither is there any defect to bee found. I Frier Odoricus was there present in person for the space of three yeeres, and was often at the sayd banquets; for we friers Minorites have a place of aboad appointed out for us in the emperors court, and are enjoined to goe and to bestow our blessing upon him. And I enquired of certaine Courtiers concerning the number of persons pertaining to the emperors court ? And they answered mee, that of stage-players, musicians, and such like, there were eighteene Thuman at the least, and that the keepers of dogs, beasts and foules were fifteene Thuman, and the physicians for the emperours body, were foure hundred; the Christians also were eight in number, together with one Saracen. At my being there, all the foresayd number of persons had all kind of necessaries both for apparell and victuals out of the emperors court. Moreover, when he will make his progresse from one countrey to another, hee hath foure troupes of horsemen, one being appointed to goe a dayes journey before, and another to come a dayes journey after him, the third to march on his right hand, and the fourth on his left, in the maner of a crosse, he himselfe being in the midst, and so every particular troupe have their daily journeys limited unto them, to the ende they may provide sufficient victuals without defect. Nowe the great Can himselfe is caried in maner following; hee rideth in a chariot with two wheeles, upon which a majesticall throne is built of the wood of Aloe, being adorned with gold and great pearles, and precious stones, and foure elephants bravely furnished doe drawe the sayd chariot, before which elephants foure great horses richly trapped and covered doe lead the way. Hard by the chariot on both sides thereof, are foure Barons laying hold and attending thereupon, to keepe all persons from approching neere unto their emperour. Upon the chariot also two milke-white Jer-falcons doe sit, and seeing any game which hee would take, hee letteth them flie, and so they take it, and after this maner doeth hee solace himselfe as hee rideth. Moreover, no man dare come within a stones cast of the chariot, but such as are appointed. The number of his owne followers, of his wives attendants, and of the traine of his first begotten sonne and heire apparant, would seeme incredible unto any man, unlesse hee had seene it with his owne eyes. The foresayd great Can hath devided his Empire into twelve partes or Provinces, and one of the sayd provinces hath two thousand great cities within the precincts thereof. Whereupon his empire is of that length and breadth, that unto whatsoever part thereof he intendeth his journy, he hath space enough for six moneths continual progresse, except his Islands which are at the least 5000. Of certaine appointed Innes or hospitals travailers throughout the whole empire. for may have all things necessary THe foresayd Emperor (to the end that travailers throughout his whole empire) hath caused certaine Innes to be provided in sundry places upon the high wayes, where all things pertaining unto victuals are in a continuall readinesse. And when any alteration or newes happen in any part of his Empire, if he chance to be farre absent from that part, his ambassadors upon horses or drome- [II. i. 63.] daries ride post unto him, and when themselves and their beasts are weary, they blow their home, at the noise whereof, the next Inne likewise provideth a horse and a man, who takes the letter of him that is weary, and runneth unto another Inne : and so by divers Innes, and divers postes, the report, which ordinarily could skarce come in 30. days, is in one naturall day brought unto the emperor: and therefore no matter of any moment can be done in his empire, but straightway he hath intelligence thereof. Moreover, when ye great Can himselfe will go on hunting, he useth this custome. Some twenty dayes journey from the citie of Kambaleth there is a forrest containing sixe dayes journey in circuit, in which forrest there are so many kinds of beasts and birds, as it is incredible to report. Unto this forrest, at the ende of every third or fourth yeere, himselfe with his whole traine resorteth, and they all of them together environ the sayd forrest, sending dogs into the same, which by hunting do bring foorth the beasts : namely, lions and stags, and other creatures, unto a most beautifull plaine in the midst of the forrest, because all the beasts of the forrest doe tremble, especially at the cry of hounds. Then commeth the great Can himselfe, being caried upon three elephants, and shooteth five 433 2 E all his Barons, and after them the rest of his courtiers and family doe all in like maner discharge their arrowes also, and every mans arrow hath a sundry marke. Then they all goe unto the beasts which are slaine (suffering the living beasts to returne into the wood that they may have more sport with them another time) and every man enjoyeth that beast as his owne, wherein he findeth his arrow sticking. Of feasts which the foure solemnizeth every yeere in his Court. the great Can FOure great feasts in a yeere doeth the emperor Can celebrate : namely, the feast of his birth, the feast of his circumcision, the feast of his coronation, and the feast of his mariage. And unto these feasts he inviteth all his Barons, his stage-players, and all such as are of his kinred. Then the great Can sitting in his throne, all his Barons present themselves before him, with wreaths and crownes upon their heads, being diversly attired, for some of them are in greene, namely, the principall : the second are in red, and the third in yellow, and they hold each man in his hand a little Ivorie table of elephants tooth, and they are girt with golden girdles of halfe a foote broad, and they stand upon their feete keeping silence. About them stand the stage-players or musicians with their instruments. And in one of the corners of a certaine great pallace, all the Philosophers or Magicians remaine for certaine howers, and doe attend upon points or characters : and when the point and hower which the sayd Philosophers expected for, is come, a certaine crier crieth out with a loud voyce, saying, Incline or bowe your selves before your Emperour : with that all the Barons fall flat upon the earth. Then hee crieth out againe ; Arise all, and immediately they all arise. Likewise the Philosophers attend upon a point or character the second time, and when it is fulfilled, the crier crieth out amaine ; Put your fingers in your eares : and foorthwith againe he saieth; Plucke them out. Againe, at the third point he crieth, Boult this meale. Many other circumstances also doe they performe, all which they say have some certaine signification : howbeit, neither would I write them, nor give any heed unto them, because they are vaine and ridiculous. And when the musicians hower is come, then the Philosophers say, Solemnize a feast unto your Lord : with that all of them sound their instruments, making a great and a melodious noyse. And immediately another crieth, Peace, peace, and they are all whist. Then come the women-musicians and sing sweetly before the Emperour, which musike was more delightfull unto me. After them come in the lions and doe their obeisance unto the great Can. Then the juglers cause golden cups full of wine to flie up and downe in the ayre, and to apply themselves unto mens mouthes that they may drinke of them. These and many other strange things I sawe in the court of the great Can, which no man would beleeve unlesse he had seen them with his owne eies, and therefore I omit to speake of them. I was informed also by certaine credible persons, of another miraculous thing, namely, that in a certaine kingdome of the sayd Can, wherein stand the mountains called Kapsei (the kingdomes name is Kalor) there growe great Gourds or Pompions, which A lambe in a being ripe, doe open at the tops, and within them is i°ur*found a little beast like unto a yong lambe, even as I my selfe have heard reported, that there stand certaine trees upon the shore of the Irish sea, bearing fruit like unto a gourd, which, at a certaine time of the yeere doe fall into the water, and become birds called Bernacles, and this is most true. Of divers provinces and cities. ANd after t h r ee y e r es I d e p a r t ed o ut of t he e m p i re His retume of Cataie, t r a v a i l i ng t he W e s t. A nd at l e n g th I c a me u n to dayes fiftie j o u r n ey t o w a r ds t he e m p i re of W t d Casan. [II. i. 64.] Pretegoani, whose principall citie is Kosan, which hath many other cities under it. From thence passing many dayes travell, I came unto a province called Casan, which is for good commodities, one of the onely provinces under the Sunne, and is very well inhabited, insomuch that when we depart out of the gates of one city we may beholde the gates of another city, as I my selfe saw in divers of them. The breadth of the sayd province is fifty dayes journey, & the length above sixty.^ In it there is great plenty of all victuals, and especially of chesnuts, and it is one of the twelve provinces of the great Can. Going on further, I came unto a certaine || Or, Thebet. kingdome called II Tebek, which is in subjection unto the great Can also, wherein I thinke there is more plenty of bread & wine then in any other part of the world besides. The people of the sayd countrey do, for the most part, inhabit in tents made of blacke felt. Their principall city is invironed with faire and beautifull walles, being built of most white and blacke stones, which are disposed checkerwise one by another, and curiously compiled together : likewise all the high wayes in this countrey are exceedingly well paved. In the sayd countrey none dare shed the bloud of a man, or of any beast, for the reverence of a certaine idole. In the foresayd city their Abassi, that is to say, their Pope is resident, being the head and prince of all idolaters (upon whom he bestoweth and distributeth gifts after his maner) even as our pope of Rome accounts himselfe to this be the head of all Christians. The women of countrey weare above an hundreth trifles about them, and they have two teeth in their mouthes as long as the tushes of a boare. When any mans father deceaseth among them, his sonne assembleth together all the priests and musicians that he can get, saying that he is determined to honour his father : then causeth he him to be caried into the field (all his kinsfolks, friends, and neighbours, accompanying him in the sayd action) where the priests with great solemnity cut 436 being done, they divide the whole body into morsels, and so leave it behinde them, returning home with prayers in the company of the sayd sonne. So soone as they are departed, certaine vultures, which are accustomed to such bankets, come flying from the mountaines, and cary away all the sayd morsels of flesh : and from thenceforth a fame is spread abroad, that the sayd party deceased was holy, because the angels of God carried him into paradise. And this is the greatest and highest honour, that the sonne can devise to performe unto his deceased father. Then the sayd sonne taketh his fathers The same head, seething it and eating the flesh thereof, but of 'j^^™ the skull he makes a drinking cup, wherein himselfe same peopie -l5 with all his family and kinred do drinke with great in William de solemnity and mirth, in the remembrance of his dead Rbrii and devoured father. Many other vile and abominable things doth the sayd nation commit, which I meane not to write, because men neither can nor will beleeve, except they should have the sight of them. Of a certaine rich man, who is fed and nourished by fiftie virgins. *\\ yTHile I was in the province of Mancy, I passed VV by the palace of a certaine famous man, which hath fifty virgin damosels continually attending upon him, feeding him every meale, as a bird feeds her yoong ones. Also he hath sundry kindes of meat served in at his table, and three dishes of ech kinde: and when the sayd virgins feed him, they sing most sweetly. This man hath in yeerely revenues thirty thuman of tagars of rise, every of which thuman yeeldeth tenne thousand tagars, and one tagar is the burthen of an asse. His palace is two miles in circuit, the pavement whereof is one plate of golde, and another of silver. Neere unto the wall of the sayd palace there is a mount artificially wrought with golde and silver, whereupon stand turrets and steeples and other delectable things for the solace tolde me that there were foure such men in the sayd It is accounted a great grace for the men kingdome. Long nailes. of that countrey to have long nailes upon their fingers, and especially upon their thumbes, which nailes they may folde about their hands: but the grace and beauty of their women is to have small and slender feet: and therefore the mothers when their daughters are yoong, do binde up their feet, that they may not grow great. Travelling on further towards the South, I arrived at a Melistorte. certaine countrey called Melistorte, which is a pleasant and fertile place. And in this countrey there was a certeine aged man called Senex de monte, who round about two mountaines had built a wall to inclose the sayd mountaines. Within this wall there were the fairest and most chrystall fountaines in the whole world: and about the sayd fountaines there were most beautifull virgins in great number, and goodly horses also, and in a word, every thing that could be devised for bodily solace and delight, and therefore the inhabitants of the countrey call the same place by the name of Paradise. The sayd olde Senex, when he saw any proper and valiant yoong man, he would admit him into his paradise. Moreover by certaine conducts he makes wine and milke [II. i. 65.] to flow abundantly. This Senex, when he hath a minde to revenge himselfe or to slay any king or baron, commandeth him that is governor of the sayd paradise, to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the sayd king or baron, permitting him a while to take his pleasure therein, and then to give him a certaine potion into such a slumber as being of force, to cast him should make him quite voide of all sense, and so being in a profound sleepe to convey him out of his paradise: who being awaked, & seeing himselfe thrust out of the paradise would become so sorowfull, that he could not in the world devise what to do, or whither to turne him. Then would he go unto the foresaid old man, beseeching him that he might be admitted againe into mitted thither, unlesse you will slay such or such a man for my sake, and if you will give the attempt onely, whether you kill him or no, I wil place you againe in paradise, that there you may remaine alwayes: then would the party without faile put the same in execution, indevouring to murther all those against whom the sayd olde man had conceived any hatred. And therefore all the kings of the east stood in awe of the sayd olde man, and gave unto him great tribute. Of the death of Senex de monte. ANd when the Tartars had subdued a great part of the world, they came unto the sayd olde man, and tooke from him the custody of his paradise: who being incensed thereat, sent abroad divers desperate and resolute persons out of his forenamed paradise, and caused many of the Tartarian nobles to be slaine. The Tartars seeing this, went and besieged the city wherein the said olde man was, tooke him, and put him to a most cruell and ignominious death. The friers in that place have this speciall gift and prerogative: namely, that by the vertue of the name of Christ Jesu, and in the vertue of his pretious bloud, which he shedde upon the crosse for the salvation of mankinde, they doe cast foorth devils out of them that are possessed. And because there are many possessed men in those parts, they are bound and brought ten dayes journey unto the sayd friers, who being dispossessed of the uncleane spirits, do presently beleeve in Christ who delivered them, accounting him for their God, and being baptised in his name, and also delivering immediatly unto the friers all their idols, and the idols of their cattell, which are commonly made of felt or of womens haire: then the sayd friers kindle a fire in a publike place (whereunto the people resort, that they may see the false gods of their neighbors burnt) and cast the sayd idols thereinto: howbeit at the first those idols came out of the fire againe. Then the friers sprinkled informe the sayd fire with holy water, casting the idols into it the second time, and with that the devils fled in the likenesse of blacke smoake, and the idols still remained till they were consumed unto ashes. Afterward, this noise & outcry was heard in the ayre: Beholde and see how I am expelled out of my habitation. And by these meanes the friers doe baptise great multitudes, who presently revolt againe unto their idols: insomuch that the sayd friers must eftsoones, as it were, underprop them anew. There was another them, and terrible thing which I saw there : for passing by a certaine valley, which is situate beside a pleasant river, I saw many dead bodies, and in the sayd valley also I heard divers sweet sounds and harmonies of musike, especially the noise of citherns, whereat I was greatly amazed. This valley conteineth in length seven or eight miles at the least, into the which whosoever entreth, dieth presently, and can by no meanes passe alive thorow the middest thereof: inhabitants thereabout decline unto the one side. Moreover, I was tempted to go in, and to see what it was. At length, making my prayers, and recommending my selfe to God in the name of Jesu, I entred, and saw such swarmes of dead bodies there, as no man would beleeve unlesse he were an eye witnesse thereof. At the one side of the foresayd valley upon a certaine stone, I saw the visage of a man, which beheld me with such a terrible aspect, that I thought verily I should have died in the same place. But alwayes this sentence, the word became flesh, and dwelt amongst us, I ceased not to pronounce, signing my selfe with the signe of the crosse, and neerer then seven or eight pases I durst not approch unto the said head: but I departed & fled unto another place in the sayd valley, ascending up into a little sandy mountaine, where looking round about, I saw nothing but the sayd citherns, which me thought I heard miraculously sounding and playing by themselves without the helpe of musicians. And being upon the toppe of the mountaine, I found 440 silver there like the scales of fishes in great abundance : and I gathered some part thereof into my bosome to shew for a wonder, but my conscience rebuking me, 1 cast it upon the earth, reserving no whit at all unto my selfe, and so, by Gods grace I departed without danger. And when the men of the countrey knew that I was returned out of the valley alive, they reverenced me much, saying that I was baptised and holy, and that the foresayd bodies were men subject unto the devils infernall, who used to play upon citherns, to the end they might allure people to enter, and so murther them. Thus much concerning those things which I beheld most certainely with mine eyes, I frier Odoricus have heere written: many strange things also I have of purpose [II. i. 66.] omitted, because men will not beleeve them unlesse they should see them. Of the honour and reverence done unto great Can. the the great Can. I Will report one thing more, which I saw, concerning It is an usuall custome in those parts, that when the forsayd Can travelleth thorow any countrey, his subjects kindle fires before their doores, casting spices thereinto to make a perfume, that their lord passing by may smell the sweet and delectable odours thereof, and much people come foorth to meet him. And upon a certaine time when he was comming towardes Cambaleth, the fame of his approch being published, a bishop of ours with certaine of our minorite friers and my selfe, went two dayes journey to meet him: and being come nigh unto him, we put a crosse upon wood, I my selfe having a censer in my hand, and began to sing with a loud voice : Veni creator spiritus. And as we were singing on this wise, he caused us to be called, commanding us to come unto him : notwithstanding (as it is above mentioned) that no man dare approch within a stones cast of his chariot, unlesse he be called, but such onely as keepe his chariot. And when we came neere unto him, he vailed his hat or bonet being of an inestimable price, doing reverence unto the crosse. And immediatly I put incense into the censer, and our bishop taking the censer perfumed him, and gave him his benediction. Moreover, they that come before the to present sayd Can do alwayes bring some oblation unto him, observing the ancient law : T h ou shalt not appeare in my presence with an empty hand. A nd for that cause we carried apples with us, and offered them in a platter with reverence unto him : and taking out two of them he did eat some part of one. A nd then he signified unto us, that we should go apart, least the horses comming on might in ought offend us. from him, and turned aside, With going unto certaine of his barons, which had bene converted to the faith by certaine friers of our order, being at the same time in his army : and we offered unto them of the foresayd apples, who received them at our hands with great to be as glad, as if we had given some great gift. joy, seeming unto us them that we departed All the premisses abovewritten frier William de Solanga hath put downe in writing even as the foresayd frier Odoricus uttered them by word of mouth, in the yeere of our Lord 1330, in the moneth of May, and in the place of S. Anthony of Padua. Neither did he regard to write them in difficult Latine or in an eloquent stile, but even as Odoricus himselfe rehearsed them, to the end that men might the more easily understand the things reported. I frier Odoricus of Friuli, of a certaine territory called Portus Vahonis, and of the order of the minorites, do testifie and beare witnesse unto the reverend father Guidotus minister of the province of S. Anthony, the marquesate of Treviso (being by him required upon mine obedience so to doe) that all the premisses above written, either I saw with mine owne eyes, or heard the same reand substantiall persons. T he ported by credible in common report also of the countreyes where I was, testifieth those things, which I saw, to be true. Many other things I have omitted, because I beheld them not with mine owne eyes. Howbeit from day to day I purpose with my selfe to travell countreyes or lands, in which action I dispose my selfe to die or to live, as it shall please my God. Of the death of frier Odoricus. for the sayd IN the yeere therefore of our Lord 1331 the forethe frier Odoricus preparing himselfe performance of his intended journey, that his travell and labour might be to greater purpose, he determined two and to present himselfe unto pope John twentieth, whose benediction and obedience being received, he, with a certaine number of friers willing to beare him company, might convey himselfe unto all the countreyes of infidels. And as he was travelling towards the pope, and not farre distant from the city of Pisa, there meets him by the way a certaine olde man, in the habit and attire of a pilgrime, saluting him by name, and saying: All haile frier Odoricus. And when the frier demaunded how he had knowledge of him : he answered: Whilest you were in India I knew you full well, yea, and I knew your holy purpose also : but see that you returne immediatly unto the coven from whence you came, for tenne dayes hence you shall depart out of this present world. Wherefore being astonished and amazed at these wordes (especially the olde man vanishing out of his sight, presently after he had spoken them) he determined to returne. And so he returned in perfect health, feeling no crazednesse nor infirmity of body. And being in his coven at Udene in the province of Padua, the tenth day after the foresayd vision, having received the Communion, and preparing himselfe unto God, yea, being strong and sound of body, hee happily rested in the Lord : whose sacred departure was signified unto the [n. i. 6y.] in these words following. In the yeere of our Lord 1331, the 14. day of Januarie, Beatus Odoricus a Frier minorite deceased in Christ, at whose prayers God shewed many and sundry miracles, which I Guetelus publique notarie of Utina, sonne of M. Damianus de Porto Gruaro, at the commandement and direction of the honorable Conradus of the Borough of Gastaldion, and one of the Councell of Utina, have written as faithfully as I could, and have delivered a copie thereof unto the Friers minorites: howbeit not of all, because they are innumerable, and too difficult for me to write. jjEc tacendum Matthaeum Gourney The voyage of Matthew Gourney, a most valiant English Knight, against the Moores of Algier in Barbarie and Spaine.
