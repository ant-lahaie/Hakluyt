The voyage of Master Andrew Barker of Bristol, with two ships, the one called the Ragged staffe, the other the Beare, to the coast of Terra firma, and the Bay of Honduras in the West Indies, in the yeere 1576. Wherein the reasons are premised which mooved him to set forth this voyage against the Spaniards: collected out of certaine notes and examinations touching this enterprise by M. Richard Hakluyt. Irst of all Andrew Barker having abode in one of the Canary Islands called Tenerif for a certaine time, and returning home left behind him Charles Chester (the sonne of Dominic Chester merchant of Bristol) to learn the language. Now the sayd Andrew Barker forthwith upon his arrivall in England, in November, 1574, fraighted a small ship (named the Speedwell of Bristol) to goe for the Canaries with cloth and other merchandise of a great value. He sent also one John Drue of Bastable as his Factor to make sale and dispose of the said goods, who when he arrived at Tenerif, landed the marchandize, and sent home the barke with some small quantity of wine, making account to sell the sayd wares to greater advantage in providing wines and sugar for the lading of another ship, which Andrew Barker had appointed to send thither. Also according to this his purpose the said Andrew in March following sent a ship called the Christopher of Dartmouth, captaine whereof was one Henry Roberts of Bristol: who when he had landed in Tenerif, & was in good hope to find the lading of his ship in a readines, contrary to his expectation, was suddenly cast into prison: the Spaniards alleaging that Andrew Barker was accused to the inquisition by Charles In recompense of which injurie (for Chester, whereupon his goods were confiscat, his factor John Drue was attached, and he also (the said captaine Roberts) being as they supposed Barkers partner, was in like sort to be imprisoned. In fine all the foresaid commodities appertaining to the said Andrew and his brother M. John Barker and others to the value of 1700 pound and upwards (as it doth appeare by proofes of record in the Admiralty) were utterly lost, being confiscat to the said inquisition. Howbeit captaine Roberts by the meanes of a frier was delivered out of prison (which cost him all the marchandize he brought with him in his ship) and so returned with dead fraight to the summe of 200 pound that afterwards Andrew Barker that discharged. no suite prevaileth against the inquisition of Spaine) & also to recover his losse of the Spaniards themselves, at his owne charge with the help of his friends hee furnished two barkes for the West Indies, the greater of which barkes was called the Ragged staffe, himselfe being captaine, & Philip Roche Master thereof, the other named the Beare had one William Coxe of Limehouse for her Master and captaine. And thus all our company being imbarked at Plimmoth on Whitsonday in the beginning of June, we set forward, & in our course we met with a ship of London, & afterwards with another ship, but tooke nothing from either of them. Our first arrival was at one of the Island of Cape Verde, named Del sal, vz. the Isle of salt, where we tooke certain fishes Isla del sal called Tortoises: and there we remained one night and halfe the day following. And from thence wee came to the Isle of Maio, being distant from Isla del [III. 529.] sal, 14 or 15 leagues, where we tooke in fresh water Th*}sk°f and inhabiting in that place, of whom we had some victuals for knives and beades : and there we remained one day and one night: but our trumpetter was trecherously slaine by those Portugals, in revenge of which murther we set Two villages on fire two of their small villages. From this Island burntwee shaped our course over the maine Ocean toward The hk of the West Indies, and arrived happily at the Island of Indians Tnnldad. Trinidad, and had conference with certaine thereof, who gave us very friendly and inhabitants courteous entertainement: and here we set up a pinnesse which we caried forth in the Ragged staffe, and traffiqued with the foresayd Indians for victuals. And after we had spent sixe dayes in this place we The hie of departed, and arrived next at the Isle of Margarita, s m aU Spanish ship having in her Margarita. w h e re we t o o ke a certaine pitch and 30 tuns of Canarie wines whereof we reserved 4 or 5 tunnes to our selves, dismissing Thence (having them without any further damage. The Isle of remained there a day) wee set saile to the Island of Curazao. Curazao, where we remained a day & a night, & tooke Cape de la there atchieved. From thence we arrived at Cape de Vela. in fresh water, at what time by the inhabitants of that Island (being few of them Spaniards, & the most part Indians) 14 of our men were treacherously hurt, but none slaine. And from thence we departed for the maine land Southwards, to a certain bay, and there we abode 3 daies, but nothing of any reckoning was j a yeia> where grewe a contention betweene our Captaine M. Andrew Barker, and his Master Philip Roche, upon comparisons made betweene them concerning the knowledge of Navigation, and about other quarels, which quarels afterward were an occasion of further mischiefe. Hence we sailed to the bay of Tulu (which is about 18 leagues South westward from Carthagena) where wee tooke a Frigat and certaine treasure therein the value of 500 pound, namely barres of gold, and lingots of silver, and some quantity of corriento or coyne in rials of plate, and certaine greene stones called Emerauds, whereof one very great, being set in gold, frier. was found Here having stayed three dayes, and now being pursued by Spanish men of warre, wee departed with the sayd treasure, and left the Frigat behind us, all 84 tied secretly about the thigh of a to travelled up into which treasure at that instant was committed to the keeping of our captaine Andrew Barker. From thence we passed to Nombre de dios, and so foorth to the Nom&re de mouth of the river of Chagre 18 leagues distant from diosNombre de dios towards the Northwest. There wee the landed 10 of our men, who woods three or foure daies to seeke the Simerons, Simerons (which are certaine valiant Negros fled from their cruel masters the Spaniards, and are become mortall enemies, ready to joyne with the English and French against them) but in their search they could find none of them. And though our men returned all free from peril of the enemie, yet the most part of the sayd ten persons presently fell sicke, and divers other of our company : so that within 14 dayes 8 or 9 of our men died of a disease called there the Calentura, which is a hote and vehement fever. And passing betweene Chagre and Veragua, we tooke a Frigat, and some Veragua. quantity of golde wee found therein. In this Frigat were 23 Spaniards whom wee set on shore, and two Flemings, them wee brought into England with us : wee had therein also foure cast pieces of Ordinance, 3 harquebuzes on crocke, 16 Spanish calivers, and a booke of Navigation : and in this Frigat some of our company came homeward into England. Thus passing forward in our course, we came to Veragua, where captaine Barker, & Philip Roche his Master, fought upon the foresayd quarel, in which combat the captaine was hurt a little in the cheeke. Here we sanke our Admirall staffe, because of her great imbarked part of our company in the leakage, and Spanish Frigat, which immediately before we had surprised. From hence (by the direction of certain Indians) we sayled into the gulfe of the Honduras : The bay of there we tooke a barke wherin were rials of plate, to Hondurasthe value of 100 pound, Maiz or Indian wheat, hennes, beefe and other small things. In this barke also were certaine Spaniards, whereof one was the Scrivano or 85 S.Francisco. b e i ng secretary of Carthagena, who (being a man of some note; was put to his ransome, which was payd in gold :^ the rest were dismissed freely. And after passing by divers Islands, we arrived at an Island called S. Francisco, the great bay, called the of two dayes next after our Honduras. And within arrivall there, William Coxe and divers others (which for certaine causes shalbe namelesse) came aboord the ship wherein the captaine then was, and disposessed him as well of the sayd ship, as of the treasure in the t he m o u th jn aptame. this our a i id o ne G e r m a ne Weiborne fought A conspiracie same, and forthwith put our captaine with violence on acTtahhe shore> w h e re he tOgether, and were both wounded. After captaine desirous to come on boord, was resisted by the persons aforesayd, who answered him that he should not come on boord till they were ready to depart. Our men had appointed ten persons of their company for the keeping of this Island of S. Francisco : but about breake of the day, on a certaine morning, sixtie Spaniards arriving secretly in the Island, surprised our people on the sudden, what time there were thirtie of our men in which surprise they slew our captaine, [III. 530.] on shore: M. Andrew M. Andrew Barker with eight others, namely, one BotherdZdeb W i l de of Bristol> a nd M i c h a el o ur Chirurgian, Richard °the\Sp7niards °^ Bristol, Thomas Sampoole, Thomas Freeman, Thomas Nightingale, Robert Jackson, Walter Newton; and the captaines boy and one other were hurt. Now after that William Coxe, and the rest (which were aboord the barke) perceived that the captaine, & some others were slain, he received them that were living into the ship, having before that time refused some of them. After this misfortune they went to an Island distant from thence a league, where Coxe devided a chaine of gold (which was found in the captaines chest after his death) amongst the company. After this Coxe in a pin e s se (which wee tooke at the Isle of Sant - x . , , . -^ The towne of w e nt lruxillo sacked by the ^rancisco) with certaine others of our men in a skyffe, English. to the towne of Truxillio, in the bay of Honduras, 86 v . N they would confesse. But before which towne they surprised, and had therein wine and oyle as much as they would, and divers other good things, but no gold nor silver, nor any other treasure which they could returne to their company, those that were in the barkes were had in chase by men of warre, whereby they were inforced every man to shift for himselfe : so for haste they left those that were in the skiffe (being 8 persons) in the bay of Honduras: what became of them afterward God knoweth. Hereupon we determined to saile for England, and being in the maine sea homeward bound, about 60 leagues from the Isle of S. Francisco, the Frigat wherein was the treasure for the adventurers, and that which pertained to the captaine to the value of 2000 pound, being overset with sayle, with a flaw of wind was overthrowen, and all the goods therein perished : therein also were 14 persons drowned, and nine saved, whereof William Coxe and William Gillam were two. After Admirall called the Ragged staffe, died. And thus at ^ J f /J length, (by the helpe of God) we arrived in the Isle ^agged staffe. of Silly neere Cornwall where we left our Frigat which Their arrival we built new upon the shore of the Honduras, having in the Isle of in her at our landing ten botisios of oyle, and the foure Stlhecast Peeces that were in John Oxnams Frigat (which the yeere before was taken in the streit of Dariene) three harquebuzes on crocke, certaine calivers, and Cervine this Philip Roche, Master of the The death of TTTI TTtT-ir A A A n Ordinance of certaine treasure: Where William Cox and Andrew John Qxna^ Browne devided the treasure amongst their company, recovered delivering to some five pound, to some sixe pound, to from the some seven pound, to some more, as every man was Spaniards. thought to have deserved. The barke and the rest of the Ordinance was left in the Island, to the use of Andrew Browne. Divers of our company, upon our arrivall at Plimmouth were committed to prison at the suite of M. John Barker of Bristol, brother unto our Captaine M. Andrew Barker, as accessaries to our captains death, and betrayers of him unto the enemie. And after straight examination of many of us, by letters of direction from her Majesties privie Counsell, the chiefe malefactors were onely chastised with long indeede before God they had imprisonment, where deserved to die : whereof some, although they escaped the rigor of mans law, yet could they not avoide the heavy judgement of God, but shortly after came to miserable ends. Which may be example to others to shew themselves faithfull and obedient in all honest causes to their captaines and governours.
