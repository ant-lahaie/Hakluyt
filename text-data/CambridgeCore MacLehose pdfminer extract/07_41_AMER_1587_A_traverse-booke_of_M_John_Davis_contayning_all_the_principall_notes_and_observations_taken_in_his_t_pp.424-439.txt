This 17 of June we set up our pinnesse. The 20 she was spoiled by the Savages. At midnight the 21 of June wee departed from this coast, our two barks for their fishing voyage, and my selfe in the pinnesse for the discovery.

The next day at 7 of the clocke in the morning, there came unto us 30 savages 20 leagues off the shore, intreating us to goe to the shore.

This 23 day at 2 of the clocke in the afternoone, having sailed 60 leagues Northwest, we ankered among an huge number of isles lying in the bottome of the sayd supposed passage, at which place the water riseth 4 fadome upright. Here as we rode at anker, a great whale passed by us, and swam West in among the isles. In this place a S. W. by W. moone maketh, a full sea. Here the compasse varied 30 degrees.

This 31 at noone, comming close by a foreland or great cape, we fell into a mighty rase, where an island of ice was carried by the force of the current as fast as our barke could saile with lum wind, all sailes bearing. This cape as it was the most Southerly limit of the gulfe which we passed over the 30 day of this moneth, so was it the North promontory or first beginning of another very great inlet, whose South limit at this present wee saw not. Which inlet or gulfe this afternoone, and in the night, we passed over : where to our great admiration we saw the sea falling down into the gulfe with a mighty overfal, and roring, and with divers circular motions like whirlepooles, in such sort as forcible streames passe thorow the arches of bridges.
