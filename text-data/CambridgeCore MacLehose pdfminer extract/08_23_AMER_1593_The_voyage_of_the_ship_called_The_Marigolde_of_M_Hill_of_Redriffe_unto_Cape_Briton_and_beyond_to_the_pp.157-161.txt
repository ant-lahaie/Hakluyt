The place for which these two ships were bound was an Island within the streightes of Saint Peter on the backe side of Newfoundland to the Southwest in the latitude of fortie seven degrees, called by the Britons [III. 192.] of Saint Malo the Isle of Ramea, but by the Savages The Isle °f and naturals of the Continent next adjoyning, Menquit: ^amea\or On which Isle are so great abundance or the huge and mightie Sea Oxen with great teeth in the moneths of April, May and June, that there have bene fifteene hundreth killed there by one small barke, in the yeere 1591, The two English shipps aforesayde, lost companie before they came to Newfoundland: and never came after together in all their voyage. Menquit. 1 - i Ti 1 1 1 1 _ r The ship of M. George Drake fell first with NewRamea, though too late in the yeere to make her voyage: where shee found a shippe of Saint Malo three parts fraighted with these fishes: the men whereof enquiring whence our shippe was and who was the Master thereof, being answered that shee was belonging to Master George Drake of Apsham, fearing to bee taken as good prize being of a Leaguer towne, and at that time out of league with England, fled so hastily that present night three and twentie that they left men and three Shallops behinde them, all which our men seazed upon and brought away as good prises home. Here our men tooke certaine Sea-oxen, but nothing such numbers as they might have had, if they had come in due season, which they had neglected. The shippe called the Marigolde fell with Cape Saint Francis in Newfoundland the eleventh of Julie, and from thence wee went into the Bay Rogneuse, and afterward doubled Cape Razo, and sayling toward the straight of Saint Peter (which is the entrance betweene Newfoundland and Cape Briton,) being unacquainted with the place, beate up and downe a very long time, and yet missed it, and at length over shot it, and fell with Cape Briton. t h e ir a r r i v a 11 t h ey found the spittes of The English Here diverse of our men went on land upon the very y Brim C a p e' where> at i 11 hi IT ^C h h n on. Q^e ^ ^ ga v ages which had roasted meate a litle before. And as they viewed the countrey they sawe divers beastes and foules, as blacke Foxes, Deere, Otters, great Foules with redde legges, Pengwyns, and certaine others. But having found no people here at this our first landing wee went againe on shipboorde, and sayled farther foure leagues to the West of Cape Briton, where wee sawe fd h p i f They goe on many Seales. And here having neede of fresh water shore tn an- we w e nt againe on shore. And passing somewhat more erpace. into the land, wee founde certaine round pondes artificially made by the Savages to keepe fish in, with certaine weares in them made to take fish. To these pondes wee repayred to fill our caske with water. Wee had not bene nJ£me f° long here, but there came one Savage with blacke long The people of hayre hanging about his shoulders who called unto us, the' comtrey weaving his handes downewarde towardes his bellie, using C£j£e these wordes, Calitogh Calitogh : as wee drewe towardes him one of our mens musket unawares shot off: whereupon hee fell downe, and rising up suddenly againe hee cryed thrise with a loude voyce Chiogh, Chiogh, Chiogh. Thereupon nine or tenne of his fellowes running right up over the bushes with great agilitie and swiftnesse came towardes us with white staves in their handes like halfe pikes, and their dogges of colour blacke not so bigge Blacke dogs. as a greyhounde followed them at the heeles; but wee retired unto our boate without any hurt at all received. Howbeit one of them brake an hogshead which wee had filled with fresh water, with a great branche of a tree which lay on the ground. Upon which occasion we bestowed halfe a dousen muskets shotte upon them, which they avoyded by falling flatte to the earth, and afterwarde retired themselves to the woodes. One of the Savages, which seemed to bee their Captaine, ware a long mantle of beastes skinnes hanging on one of his shoulders. The rest were all naked except their privities, which were covered with a skinne tyed behinde. After they had escaped our shotte they made a great fire on the shore, belike to give their fellowes warning of us. The kindes of trees that wee noted to bee here, were goodly Okes, Firre trees of a great height, a kinde of tree called of us Quickbeame, and Cherie trees, and diverse other kindes to us unknowne, because wee stayed not long with diligence to observe them: and there is great shewe of rosen, pitch, and tarre. Wee found in both the places where wee went on land abundance of Raspeses, Strawberies, Hurtes, and herbes of good smell, and divers good for the skurvie, and grasse very ranke and of great length. Wee sawe five or sixe boates sayling 4 secret trade to the Southwestwardes of Cape Briton, which wee judged t0 the ^h to bee Christians, which had some trade that way. Wee ^^ hanging up of their fish and flesh with withes to dry in the ayre: they also lay them upon raftes and hurdles and make a smoake under them, or a softe fire, and so drie them as the Savages use to doe in Virginia.

West of Cape course to the West of Cape Briton we saw exceeding Bnton. great store of seales, and abundance of Porposes, whereof Seaks *Por- we killed eleven. We sawe Whales also of all sortes posesJWhales aswell small as great: and here our men tooke many and Cods. berded Coddes with one teate underneath, which are like to the Northeast Cods, and better then those of Newfoundland.

One thing very strange hapened in this An hu& voyage: to witte, that a mightie great Whale followed Zeftfoirship our shippe by the space of many dayes as we passed by ^ t^e space of Cape RazOj which by no meanes wee coulde chase from many dayes, our ship, untill one of our men fell overboord and was till one of their drowned, after which time shee immediatly forsooke us, ™enfelloverj r i i OOOVa. and never afterward appeared unto us. A briefe note concerning the voyage of M. George Drake of Apsham to Isle of Ramea in the aforesayd yere 1593. j]N the beginning of the former relation written by Richard Fisher servant to the worshipfull Master Hill of Redriffe is, as you reade, a briefe reporte of their loosing of their consort the shippe of Master George Drake of Apsham: which though shee came directly to the Isle of Ramea, yet because shee was not ready so soone by two moneths as she ought to have bene, she was not onely the hinderance of her consort the Marigolde, & lost the season of the yere for the making of her voyage of killing the Morses or Sea Oxen, which are to be taken in Aprill, May, and June: but also suffered the fit places and harboroughs in the Isle which are but two, as farre as I can learne, to be forestalled and taken up by the Britons of Saint Malo and the Baskes of Saint John de Luz, by comming a day after the Fayre, as wee say. Which lingering improvidence of our men hath bene the overthrowe of many a worthy enterprize and of the undertakers of the same. The relation of this voyage at large I was promised by the Authour himselfe: but the same not comming to my handes in tyme I am constrained to leave it out. The want whereof, for the better understanding of the state of the sayde Island, the frequenting of that gainefull trade by the aforesayd nations of the Britons and Baskes, may in part be supplyed by the voyage of Master Charles l 6l VIII
