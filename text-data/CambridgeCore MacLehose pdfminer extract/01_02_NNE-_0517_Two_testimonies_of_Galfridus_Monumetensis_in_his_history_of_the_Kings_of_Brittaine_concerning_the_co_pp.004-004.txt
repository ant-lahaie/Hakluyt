Missis deinde in diversa regna Legatis, invitantur tarn ex Galliis, quam ex coUateralibus Insulis Oceani, qui ad curiam venire deberent, &c. Et paulo post: Ex coUateralibus autem Insulis, Guillaumurius rex Hyberniae, Malvasius rex Islandiae, Doldavius rex Gotlandiae, Gunnasius rex Orchadum, Lot rex Noruegiae, Aschilius rex Danorum.

Lib. 9 cap. 19. AT reges caeterarum Insularum, quoniam non duxerant in morem equites habere, pedites quot quisque debebat, promittunt, ita ut ex sex Insulis, videlicet, Hyberniae, Islandiae, Gotlandias, Orcadum, Noruegias, atque Daciae, sexies viginti millia essent annumerata. [I. 2.] The same in English. B1 >Ut the kings of the other Islands, because it was * not their custome to breed up horses, promised the king as many footmen, as every man was bound to send : so that out of the six Islands, namely, of Ireland, Island, Gotland, Orkney, Norway, and Denmarke, the king had sixe score thousand souldiers sent him.
