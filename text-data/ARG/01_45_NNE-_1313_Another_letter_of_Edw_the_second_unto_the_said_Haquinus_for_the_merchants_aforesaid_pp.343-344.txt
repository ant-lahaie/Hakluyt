Another Letter of Edward the second, to Haqui-nus King of Norway, in the behalfe of cer-taine English Marchants.
MAgnifico Principi Dom. Haquino Dei gratia regi IVA Norwegiae illustri, amico suo charissimo, Edwardus eadem Dei gratia Rex Angliae, dominus Hyberniae, & dux Aquitaniae, salutem cum dilectione sincera. Querelam dilectorum Mercatorum nostrorum Thomae de Swyn de Waynfleete, & Simonis filii Alani de eadem recepimus, continentem, Quod ciim ipsi nuper quosdam servientes suos infra regnum vestrum pro suis ibidem exercendis mercimoniis transmisissent, Thesaurarius vester bona & mercimonia praedictorum Thomae & Simonis ad valenciam quadraginta librarum, quae servientes praedicti in villa de Northberne in sua custodia habuerunt, die Sancti Michaelis ultimo praeterita fecit absque causa rationabili arestari, & ea adhuc taliter arestata detinet injusti, in ipsorum Thomae & Simonis damnum non modicum & depauperationem manifestam. Et quia eisdem mercatoribus nostris subvenire volumus, quatenus suadente justitia poterimus in hac parte, vestram amicitiam requirimus cum affectu, quatenus audita querela praedictorum Thomae & Simonis, vel ipsorum atturnatorum super restitutione bonorum & mercimoniorum praedictorum impendere velitis eisdem celeris justitiae complementum : Ita quod pro defectu exhibitionis justitiae super arestatione praedicta non oporteat nos pro mercatoribus nostris praedictis de alio remedio providere. Nobis autem quid ad hanc nostram instantiam duxeritis faciendum, rescribere velitis per praesentium portitorem. Datae ut supra.

Michael last past, without any just or reasonable occasion, caused the goods and merchandise of the foresaide Thomas and Simon, to the value of fortie pound, which their said servants had under their custodie at the towne of North-berne, to be arrested, and as yet also injuriously deteineth the same under the same arrest, to the great damage and impoverishing of the sayd Thomas and Simon. And forasmuch as our desire is to succour these our marchants so far foorth as we can, Justice requiring no lesse in this behalfe, we doe right earnestly request you, that having hearde the complaint and supplication of the foresayde Thomas and Simon, or of their Atturneyes, you woulde of your love and friendship, vouchsafe them speedie administration of Justice, about the restitution of their goods and marchandise aforesaide: least that for want of the exhibiting of Justice about the foresaid arrest, we be constrained to provide some other remedie for our marchants aforesaid. Our request is, that you would by the bearer of these presents, returne an answere unto us, what you are determined to doe, at this our instant motion. Given as above.
