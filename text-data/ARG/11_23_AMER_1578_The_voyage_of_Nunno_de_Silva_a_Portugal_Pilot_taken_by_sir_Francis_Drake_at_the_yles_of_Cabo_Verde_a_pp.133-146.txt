The relation of a Voyage made by a Pilot called 1579. Nuno da Silva for the Vice-roy of new Spaine, the 20. of May, in the yere of our Lord 1579. in the citie of Mexico, from whence it was sent to the Vice-roy of the Portugall-Indies: wherein is set downe the course and actions passed in the Voyage of Sir Francis Drake that tooke the aforesayd Nuno da Silva at S. Iago one of the Islands of Cabo Verde, and caried him along with him through the Streights of Magellan, to the Haven of Guatulco in new Spaine, where he let him goe againe.
Uno da Silva borne in Porto, a Citizen and inhabitant of Guaia, saith, that hee departed out of his house in the beginning of November in the yeere of our Lorde 1577. taking his course to Cabo Verde, or The greene Cape, where he anchored with his Shippe close by the
Haven of the Island of Sant Iago, one of the Islandes of Cabo Verde aforesayde, beeing the nineteenth of 133
 January in the yeere of our Lord 1578. And lying there, there came sixe ships, which seemed to be Englishmen, whereof the Admirall boorded his ship, and by force with his men tooke him out of his ship, bringing him in the boate aboord the Admirals shippe, leaving some of his best men aboord his ship: and although the fortresse of the Island shot foure or five times at them, yet they hurt not the Englishmen: who having done, set saile from thence to the Island of Brava, taking with them the ship of the sayd Nuno da Silva: being there, they filled certaine vessels with fresh water: from thence holding their course inward to sea, having first with a boat set the men of Nuno da Silvas ship on land, onely keeping Nuno da Silva in his ship, as also his ship with the wines that were therein. And Nuno da Silva saith, the cause why they kept him on boord was, because they knew him to bee a pilot for the coast of Brasilia, that hee might bring them to such places in those countreys as had fresh water.
Being put off" from the Island of Brava, they helde their course to the land of Brasilia, which they descried upon the first of Aprill, under the height of thirtie degrees: and without landing or taking in fresh water, Rio de Plata, they helde on their course to Rio de la Plata, that is, The river of silver, lying under five and thirtie degrees, little more or lesse: where they went on land, and provided themselves of fresh water.
From thence they helde on their course till they came under nine and thirtie degrees, where they ankered : and beeing there they left two of their sixe shippes behinde them, and sailed but foure in companie (that of Nuno da Silva being one) till they came to the Bay called Bay de las Baya de las Islas, that is, The Bay of the Hands, lying under nine and fortie degrees, where it is sayde, that Magellan lay and wintered there with his shippe, when hee first discovered the Streight, which now holdeth his name. Into this Bay the twentieth of June they entred, and there ankered so close to the land, that they might 134
send to it with a harquebuse shot: and there they sawe the land to bee inhabited with Indians, that were apparelled with skinnes, with their legges from the knees downe-ward, and their armes from the elbowes downeward naked, all the rest of their bodies beeing clothed, with bowes and arrowes in their handes, being subtill, great, and well formed people, and strong and high of stature: where sixe of the Englishmen went on land to fetch fresh water, and before they leapt on land, foure of the Indians came unto their boate, to whome the Englishmen gave bread and wine: and when the Indians had well eaten and drunke, they departed thence: and going somewhat farre from them, one of the Indians cryed to them, and sayde: Magallanes, Esta he minha Terra, that is, Magallanes, this is my countrey: and because the Englishmen followed them, it seemed the Indians fledde upward into the land, and beeing somewhat farre off, they turned backe againe, and with their arrowes slewe two of the English shippers, one being an Englishman, the other a Netherlander: the rest came backe againe and saved themselves in the boate, wherewith they presently put off from the shore. Here they stayed till the seventeenth of August, upon the which day they set saile, running along by the coast about a league and a halfe from the land, (for there it is all faire and good ground, at twentie, and five and twentie fathome deepe) and were about foure or five dayes before they came to the mouth or entrie of the Streight: but because the wind was contrary, they stayed till the 24 of August before they entred.
The entrie or mouth of the Streight is about a league The descrif-broad, on both sides being bare and flatte land: on the turn of The North side they sawe Indians making great fires, but on the South side they saw no people stirring. The foure *	‘
and twentieth day aforesayd, they beganne to enter into the Streight, with an Eastnortheast wind. This Streight may bee about an hundred and tenne leagues long, and in bredth a league. About the entry of the Streight, and
J35
halfe way into it, it runneth right foorth without any windings or turnings: and from thence about eight or tenne leagues towards the ende, it hath some boutes and windings, among the which there is one so great a hooke or headland, that it seemed to runne into the other land: and there it is lesse then a league broad from one land to the other: and from thence forward it runneth straight out againe: And although you finde some crookings, yet they are nothing to speake of. The issue of the Streight lieth Westward, and about eight or tenne leagues before you come to the ende, then the Streight beginneth to bee broader, and it is all high land to the ende thereof, after you are eight leagues within the Streight, for the first eight leagues after you enter is low flat land, as I sayd before : and in the entrie of the Streight you find the streame to runne from the South sea to the North sea.
And after they began to saile in with the Eastnortheast wind, being entred they passed along without any let or hinderance either of wind or weather: and because the high land on both sides lay covered with snow, and that all the Streight is faire and cleare, they helde their course a  harquebuse-shot in length from off the North side, having nine and tenne fathome depth, with good ground, as I said before, where (if neede require) a man may anker : the hilles on both sides being full of trees, some of the hilles and trees reaching downe to the sea -side in some places having plaine and even land: and there they sawe not any great rivers, but some small rivers that issued out of the rifles and breaches of the land: and in the countrey where the great Cape or crooking is, on the South side they saw certaine Indian fishermen in their Canoas or skiffs, being such as they saw first on the North side, but more people they saw not on the South side.
Being out of the Streight on the other side, upon the sixt of September of the aforesaid yeere, they held their course Northwest for the space of three dayes, and the third day they had a Northeast wind, that by force drave them Westsouthwest, which course they held for 136
the space of ten or twelve dayes with few sailes up: and because the wind began to be very great, they tooke in all their sailes, and lay driving till the last of September.
The 24 day of the same moneth having lost the sight of This was the one of their shippes which was about an hundred tunne, then againe they hoised saile because the winde came Winters better, holding their course Northeast for the space of seven dayes, and at the ende of the sayde seven dayes, they had the sight of certayne Islands, which they made towards for to anker by them, but the weather would not permit them: and being there, the wind fell Northwest: whereupon they sailed Westsouthwest.
The next day they lost the sight of another ship of their company, for it was very foule weather, so that in the ende the Admirals shippe was left alone, for the ship of Nuno da Silva was left in the Bay where they wintered before they entered into the Streights: and with this foule weather they ranne till they were under seven and They were fiftie degrees, where they entred into a haven of an drivenunt0 Island, and ankered about the length of the shot of a great piece from the land, at twentie fathome deepe, latitude. where they stayed three or foure dayes, and the wind comming Southward, they weyed anker, holding their course Northward for the space of two daies, and then they espied a small unhabited Island, where being arrived, they stroke sailes, and hoised out their boate, and there they tooke many birds and Seales.
The next day they set saile againe, holding their course Northnortheast, and North, to another Island lying five The Isle of or sixe leagues from the firme land, on the North side Mocha in 38. of the Streight, where they ankered about a quarter 3°‘ mm' of a league from the land, in twelve fathome water.
This Island is small and lowe land, and full of Indians, the Island being altogether possessed and inhabited by them, where they hoysed out their boate, wherein the Admirall and twelve Englishmen entred, going to fetch fresh water, and to seeke for victuals: and being landed upon the Island, the Indians in exchange of other things, 137
brought two Spanish sheepe, and a little Maiz or rootes whereof they make bread, and because it was late, they returned againe unto their ship, without doing any other thing for that day.
The next day the said Captaine with the aforesaid twelve men being harquebusiers, rowed to land againe, and set two of their company on shore with their vessels to fetch fresh water, and by the place where they should fill their water there lay certaine Indians secretly hidden, that fell upon the two Englishmen and tooke them: which they in the boat perceiving, went out to helpe them, but they were so assailed with stones & arrowes, that all or Sir Frandt the most part of them were hurt, the Captaine himselfe being wounded with an arrow on the face, and with an w u ' other arrow in the head, whereby they were constrained to turne backe againe, without once hurting any of the Indians, and yet they came so neere the boate, that they tooke foure of their oares from them. This done, they set saile againe, running along the coast with a South winde, sailing so for the space of sixe dayes, passing by the haven called Sant Iago, and put into another haven, and there they tooke an Indian that lay fishing in a Canoa, giving him linnen and butchers chopping knives, with other trifles, and not long after there came another Indian aboord their shippe called Felippe, and he spake Spanish, he gave the English Captaine notice of a certaine shippe that lay in the haven of Sant Iago, which they had left sixe leagues behind them : with that intelligence the Indian being their guide, the next day they set saile and went to the aforesayd haven of S. Iago, and entring therein, they tooke the said shippe, wherein they found a thousand seven hundred and 70 Botijas or Spanish pots full of wine, and other things : which having done, they lept on land, where they tooke certaine sackes with meale, with whatsoever they could find; they tooke likewise the ornaments and the reliques out of the Church, wherewith they departed from thence, taking the aforesayd shippe, with two 138
men (that they found in her) with them, and so departed from that haven, which lyeth under 32 degrees and a halfe, running along by the coast till they came under one and thirtie, and thirtie degrees : which was the place where they had appointed to meete, and there to stay for ech other, if by tempest or foule weather they chanced to be separated, and so loose eche others company.
And comming under thirtie degrees, they found a very good haven, whereinto they entred, and ankered at sixe fathome deepe, the shot of a great peece from the land, which was right over against a river, where they tooke in sixe pipes of fresh water : and to defend them that fetched the water, they set twelve men upon the land, and being busied in filling of their water, they espied a company of men comming towards them, whereof halfe of them were Spaniards, being about two hundred and fifty horsemen, and as many foote-men, but they had no sooner espied them, but they presently entred into the boat, and escaped away, loosing but one man.
The same night they set saile againe with both their ships, running along the coast about ten leagues farther, where they tooke in some fresh water, but because they perceived certaine horsemen, they departed without lading any more water.
From thence they followed on their course along the coast for the space of 30. leagues, where they entred into a desert or unhabited haven : yet they went not on land, for every day they saw people upon the shore, & there they made out a smal pinnesse, the peeces wherof they brought ready framed out of England, and having prepared it, they launched it into the water, wherein the Captaine with fifteene men entred with the chiefe boatesman called John the Greeke, (being Master of the ship which they had taken in the haven of S. Iago,) wherewith they went to see if they could find the two shippes that they had lost by stormie 139

weather, as I sayd before: and likewise thinking to goe on land to fill certaine vessels with fresh water, they durst not venture, for they saw people on all sides of the shore : so that in the ende they returned againe without hearing of the other ships: being there, they tooke all the ordinance out of their ship, and new dressed and rigged her : which done, they put a small peece of ordinance into the pinnesse, wherewith they set saile againe, following on their course.
Having sailed thirteene dayes, they came to an Island lying about the shotte of a base from the land, where they ankered, and there they found foure Indian fishermen in two Canoas who told them that on the firme land they might have fresh water, but they understanding that there was not much, and that it was somewhat within the land, would not spend any time about it, but set saile againe, leaving the fishermen with their Canoas, following on their course along by the shore.
The next day being somewhat further, they espied certaine Indian fishermen that were upon the land in their houses, which the English captaine perceiving, presently entred into his pinnesse, and rowed on land, where he tooke three of the said fishermen, taking with him halfe of the fish that lay packed upon the shore ready to be laden, with the which Indians and booty, they came on boord againe.
The next day following, they saw a barke laden with fish, that belonged to the Spaniards, with foure Indians in it. This barke with the Indians and the fish they tooke, and bound the Spanish ship to their sterne, and so drewe it after them, leaving the said Indians within it, who by night unbound the barke, and secretly made away with barke and fish, and were no more seene. The next day the Captaine went into the pinnesse, and because fie saw certaine houses upon the shore, he made thither, and being on land, he found two men in them, one whereof he tooke, leaving the other
140
behind, and there he found three thousand pezos of silver, (every pezo being the value of a ryall of eight,) and seven Indian sheepe, and hennes, & tooke al ■whatsoever they found : wherewith they departed from thence, following on their course. And two dayes after they came to the haven called Arica, where they found Arica. two ships, the one laden with goods and Spanish wares, out of the which they tooke only two hundred Botijas, or Spanish pots with wine, and out of the other seven and thirty barres of silver, which are peeces of ten or twelve pound eche barre, and thinking to leape on shore (with two barks that they found in the said haven, with about seven and thirty harquebuses and bowes) they perceived on the land certaine horsemen comming towards them, whereupon they left off their pretence, and tooke with them a Negro that they found in the barks, with whom they returned aboord.
The next day in the morning they burnt the ship, that was laden with the Spanish wares, and tooke the other with them, passing forward with it on their course, the Captaine sailing along the shore with his pinnesse, and the ship keeping about a league from him to seaward, to seeke for a ship wherof they had intelligence: and having in that maner sailed about five and forty leagues, they found the ship that lay at anker in a haven, who about two houres before had bene advertised of an English pirate or sea-rover, and had discharged eight hundred barres of silver out of her, and hidden it on the land, which silver belonged to the king of Spaine, of the which silver the English-  men had received some intelligence, but they durst not go on land, because there were many Indians and Spaniards that stood to gard it, and they found nothing in the ship but three pipes of water : the ship they tooke with them, and being about a league in the sea, they hoysed up all her sailes and let her drive, doing the like with the ship that they had taken in Arica, as
141
also the other of Sant Iago, which likewise they let drive, following on their course with their owne ship, and the pinnesse.
Being seven or eight leagues from the haven of Calao de Lyma, they espied three ships, and boording one of them, they tooke three men out of her, and so held on their course towards Calao de Lyma, where they entred, being about two or three houres within night, sailing in betweene all the ships that lay there, being seventeene in number: and being among the ships, they asked for the ship that had laden the silver, but when answere was made them, that the silver was layd on land, they cut the cables of the ships, and the masts of two of the greatest ships, and so left them. At the same time there arrived a ship from Panama laden with wares and merchandise of Spaine, that ankered close by the English ship, which was, while the English Captaine sought in the other ships for the silver. Assoone as the ship of Panama had ankered, there came a boat from the shore to search it: but because it was in the night, they let it alone till morning, and comming to the English ship, they asked what ship it was : whereupon one of the Spanish prisoners (by the English Captaines commandement) answered and said it was the ship of Michael Angelo, that came from Chili: which they of the boat hearing sent a man on board, who climing up, light upon one of the great peeces, wherewith he was afraid, and presently stept backe againe into the boat (because the shippes that lay there, and that sailed in those countreys, used to carry no great shot) and therewith they were abashed, and made from it: which the ship of Panama hearing, that was newly come in, shee judged it to be a rover, and therewith cutting her cables, shee put to sea, which the Englishmen perceiving, shipped certaine men in their pinnesse, and followed her: and being hard by her, they badde her strike, which they of the ship refused to doe, and with a harquebuse shot
142
killed one of the Englishmen, wherewith they turned againe into their shippe, and presently set saile, following after the ship, which not long after they overtooke : which they of the shippe perceiving hoysed out their boate, and leaping into it, rowed to the land, leaving the shippe with all the goods, which the Englishmen presently tooke, and with her sayled on their course.
The next day they saw a boat with sailes making towards them, whereby they presently mistrusted it to be a spie, and not long after they perceived two great ships comming towards them, which made the English thinke they came to fight with them, whereupon they let the shippe of Panama drive, therein leaving John the Greeke, with the two men that they had taken the same day that they entred into the Calao de Lyma, as I sayde before, and presently hoysed all their sailes, and sailed forward, not once setting eye againe upon the aforesayde ships, for they made towards the ship of Panama, which the Englishmen let drive. From thence they sailed againe along the coast, following on their course: and having sailed certaine dayes, they met a frigate that went towards Lyma, laden with wares and merchandises of the countrey, from whence the Englishmen tooke a lampe and a fountaine of silver, and asked the pilote being a Spaniard, if they met not with a ship, that they understood should be laden with silver, but the one Pilote saide he met her not, and the other said he saw her about three dayes before. This frigat came not to the ship, but to the pinnesse, wherein the Captaine sailed, for the pinnesse ranne close by the shore, and the ship kept a league and a halfe from the lande: whereupon they let the frigate goe, following on their course.
Two dayes after, they came to the haven called Payta, Payta. where they found a ship laden with Spanish wares, which the pinnesse boorded, and tooke without any resistance: for assoone as the Spaniards perceived the Englishmen, they presently made to land with their boate, and two of them lept into the sea, none staying in the shippe, but
143
the Master, Pilote, and some Negros, out of the which shippe the Englishmen tooke the pilote, and all the bread, hennes and a hogge, and so sailed forward with the ship: but being about two harquebuse shot to seaward, they let it goe againe, not taking any thing out of it, and asking after the ship, which they sought for, they told them that about two dayes before she departed from that place, wherewith they followed on their course, and before night they met with a ship of Panama, which they presently boorded, but tooke nothing from her but onely a Negro, and so left it, holding on their course.
The next day being the first of Februarie, they met another ship that sailed to Panama, laden with fish and other victuals, and fortie barres of silver, and some gold, but I know not how much, which they tooke, and sent the passengers (with two friers that were in her) in a boate  to land. The next day they hanged a man of the ship, because hee would not confesse two plates of golde that he had taken, which after they found about him: which done, they let the ship drive, following on their course.
The first of March towards noone, they espied the ship laden with silver, being about foure leagues to seaward from them: and because the English ship was somewhat heavie before, whereby it sailed not as they would have it, they tooke a company of Botijas or A/retie de- Spanish pots for oyle, and filling them with water, hung vice to make them by ropes at the sterne of the ship to make her sayle ^on ^wiftl^ better: and the shippe that sayled towardes Panama swJty- maje towards the English shippe to know what shee was, thinking it to bee one of the shippes that used to saile along the coastes, and to traffique in the countrey: and beeing hard by her, the English Captaine badde them strike, but the other refusing to doe it, with a great peece hee shotte her mast overboord, and having wounded the Master with an arrowe, the shippe presently yeelded, which they tooke, and sayled with her further into the sea, all that night and the next day and night, making all the way they could.
144
The third day being out of sight of the land, they beganne to search the ship, and to lade the goods out of her into their ship, which was a thousand three hundred barres or peeces of silver, and foureteene chestes with ryals of eight, and with gold: but what quantitie it was I know not, onely the passengers sayd that there was great store, and that three hundred barres of the silver belonged to the king, the rest belonged to certaine merchants. That done, they let the ship with the men saile on their course, putting the three pilots in her that they brought with them, so that as then they had none but their owne men aboord, being the sixt of March, and from thence they held their course towards the land of Nicaragua.
The thirteenth of March, either the day before or after, in the morning they descried land, not being very high, being a small Island two leagues from the firme land, and there they found a small Bay, wherein they ankered at five fathome deepe close by the land, and there they stayed till the twentie day. Upon the which day there passed a Frigate close by the Island, which with their pinnesse they followed, and taking her, brought her to the English ship, which frigat was laden with Salsaperilla, and Botijas or pots with butter and hony, and with other things. The English Captaine went on boord, and cast the Salsaperilla on the land, leaving all the rest of the wares in the frigate, and then he put all his peeces into the frigate, that so he might lay his ship on shore, to new calke and trimme her, which continued till the three and twentie or foure and twentie of March. Which done, and having made provision of wood and fresh water, they held on their course along by the coast, sayling Westward, taking the sayd frigate and her men with them, and having sailed two dayes, they tooke their men out of her, and set them in the pinnesse, among the which were foure sailers, that meant to sayle to Panama, and from thence to China, whereof one they tooke, with the letters and patents that hee had about him, among

And so sailing untill the sixt of Aprill, about evening they discovered a shippe that held two leagues to seaward from the land: and before the next day in the morning they were hard by her, and suddenly fell upon her while her men slept, and presently made the men enter into their ship, among the which was one Don Francisco Xarate. Which done, they followed on their course with the sayd ship, out of the which they tooke certaine packes and other wares, but I know not what it was. They likewise tooke a Negro out of it, and three dayes after they both let the ship and men goe whether they woulde, setting therein the two saylers that should goe for China, which they had taken in the frigate, keeping onely one sailer to shewe them where they should find fresh water, to the which ende they tooke the emptie vessels with them to fill with water, and so kept on their course to the haven of Guatulco, where they put in, being upon Munday the thirteenth of Aprill, and having ankered, they stayed there till the sixe and twentie of Aprill: and about three or foure houres within the night, they set sayle, holding their course Westward, and an houre or two before they let Nuno da Silva goe, putting him into another ship, that lay in the haven of Guatulco.
From thence forward the Englishmen passed on their voyage, to the Islands of Malucos, and from thence they passed by the Cape de Buena Esperanza, and so to England, as it is well knowen, so that thjs is onely the description of the voyage that they made, while the said pilote Nuno da Silva was with them.
