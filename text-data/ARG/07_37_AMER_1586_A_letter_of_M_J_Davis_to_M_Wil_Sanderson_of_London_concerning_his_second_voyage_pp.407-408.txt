Master Davis being arrived, wrote his letter to M. William Sanderson of London, concerning his voyage, as folioweth.
Ir, the Sunneshine came into Dartmouth the fourth of this moneth: she hath bene at Island, and from thence to Greenland, and so to Estotiland, from thence to Desolation, and to our Marchants, where she made trade with the people, staying in the countrey twentie dayes. They
have brought home five hundred seale skinnes, and an hundred and fortie halfe skinnes and pieces of skinnes.
I stand in great doubt of the pinnesse, God be mercifull
407
unto the poore men, and preserve them, if it be his blessed will.
I have now experience of much of the Northwest part of the world, & have brought the passage to that likelihood, as that I am assured it must bee in one of foure places, or els not at all. And further I can assure you upon the perill of my life, that this voyage may be performed without further charge, nay with certaine profite to the adventurers, if I may have but your favour in the action. I hope I shall finde favour with you to see your Card. I pray God it be so true as the Card shal be which I will bring you: and I hope in God, that your skill in Navigation shall be gaineful unto you, although at the first it hath not proved so. And thus with my humble commendations I commit you to God, desiring no longer to live, then I shall be yours most faithfully to command. Exon this fourteenth of October. 1586.
Yours to command
John Davis.
