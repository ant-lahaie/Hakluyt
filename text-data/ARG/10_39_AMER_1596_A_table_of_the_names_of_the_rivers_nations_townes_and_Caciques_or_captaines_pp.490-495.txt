In one worde; The time serveth, the like occasion seidome happeneth in many ages, the former repeated considerations doe all joyntly together importune us, nowe, or never to make our selves rich, our posteritie happie, our Prince every way stronger then our enemies, and to establish our Countrey in a state flourishing and peaceable. O let not then such an indignitie rest on us, as to deprave so notable an enterprise with false rumors, and vaine suppositions, to sleepe in so serious a matter, and renouncing the honour, strength, wealth, and soveraigntie of so famous a conquest, to leave all unto the Spaniard.

	1	These are enemies to the laos, their money is of white and greene stones. They speake the Tivitivas language ; so likewise doe the nation of the Arricari, who have greater store of those moneyes then any others. 2	Here it was as it seemeth, that Vincent Pinzon the Spaniard had his Emeralds.

the mouth thereof, the inhabitants doe passe with their canoas in 20. dayes to the salte lake, where Manoa standeth. The water hath many Cataracts like Caroli, but that they are of greater distance one from another : where it falles into the sea, hils do inclose it on both sides.
10 The freshet shoots out into the sea, with great force : the sea doth here sometimes campe high, and breake, as if it were full of rocks : but in proofe it is nothing els but the pride & force of the tydes. In this bay, & round about, so far as the mountaines do extend there is great store of Brasill wood, some of it bearing farre darker colour then other some. Here are also many sortes of other good woods.
14 These speake the language of the Indians of Dominica. They are but few, but very cruel to their enemies. For they bind, and eat them alive peecemeale. This torment is not comparable to the deadly paine that commeth of hurts, or woundes, made by those arrowes that are invenomed with the juice of ye herbe Wapototo. These Indians because they eate them whome they kill, use no poyson. The sea coast is nowhere populous, for they have much wasted themselves, in mutuall warres. But now in all parts so farre as Orenoque, they live in league and peace.
21. Neere the head of this river, Capeleppo falleth out of the plaines, and runneth into the Sea with Curitini. Some of the Guianians live in this river.
39. This river, as also most of the rest, is not navigable above sixe dayes journey by reason of rockes. It is tenne dayes journey to the head, where the Guianians do dwel: hony, yarne or cotton, silke, Balsamum, and Brasil-493

beds are here to bee had in plentie, and so all the coast alongst Eastward. Some images of golde, spleenestones, and others may bee gotten on this coast, but they doe somewhat extraordinarily esteeme of them, because every where they are current money. They get their Moones, & other pieces of gold by exchange, taking for each one of their greater Canoas, one piece or image of golde, with three heades, and after that rate for their lesser Canoas, they receive pieces of golde of lesse value. One hatchet is the ordinarie price for a Canoa. They have every where divers sorts of drugs, gummes, and rootes, which I doubt not by farther trial, will be found medicinable.
