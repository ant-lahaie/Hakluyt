Underneath the aforesaid unperfite relation that which followeth is written in another letter sent to M. John Growte student in Paris from Jaques Noel of S. Malo, the grand nephew of Jaques Cartier.
Can write nothing else unto you of any thing that I can recover of the writings of Captaine Jaques Cartier my uncle dis-ceased, although I have made search in all places that I could possibly in this Towne: saving of a certaine booke made in maner of a sea Chart, which was
drawne by the hand of my said uncle, which is in the possession of master Cremeur: which booke is passing vin	273	s
well marked and drawne for all the River of Canada, whereof I am well assured, because I my self have knowledge thereof as farre as to the Saults, where I have bene: The Saults are The height of which Saults is in 44. degrees. I found in sa^ Chart beyond the place where the River is â€™ ' divided in twaine in the midst of both the branches of the said river somewhat neerest that arme which runneth toward the Northwest, these words following written in the hand of Jaques Cartier.
By the people of Canada and Hochelaga it was said, That here is the land of Saguenay, which is rich and wealthy in precious stones.
 And about an hundred leagues under the same 1 found written these two lines following in the said Carde enclin-ing toward the Southwest. Here in this Countrey are Cinamon and Cloves, which they call in their language Canodeta.
Touching the effect of my booke whereof I spake unto you, it is made after the maner of a sea Chart, which I have delivered to my two sonnes Michael and John, which at this present are in Canada. If at their returne, which will be God willing about Magdalene tyde, they have learned any new thing worthy the writing, I will not faile to advertise you thereof.
Your loving Friend, Jaques Noel.
