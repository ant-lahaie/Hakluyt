A note of the proceeding of M. Anthonie Jenkinson, Ambassadour from the Queenes most excellent Majestie, to the Emperour of Russia, from the time of his arrivall there, being the 26. of July 1571, untill his departure from thence the 23. of July 1572.
He said 26. day I arrived with the two good ships called the Swalow and the Harry in safetie, at the Baie of S. Nicholas in Russia aforesayd, and landed at Rose Island, from whence immediately I sent away my interpreter Daniel Silvester in post towards the Court,
being then at the Mosco, whereby his majestie might as well bee advertised of my arrivall in his Dominions, as also to know his highnesse pleasure for my further accesse. And remaining at the sayd Island two or three dayes, to have conference with your Agent about your affaires, I did well perceive by the wordes of the sayd Agent and others your servants, that I was entred into
170
great perill and danger of my life : for they reported to mee that they heard said at the Mosco, that the princes displeasure was such against me, that if ever I came into his countrey againe, I should loose my head, with other words of discouragement. Whereat I was not a litle dis-maid, not knowing whether it were best for me to proceed forwards, or to returne home againe with the ships for the safegard of my life. But calling to mind mine innocencie and good meaning, and knowing my selfe not to have offended his Majestie any maner of wayes either in word or deed, or by making former promises not performed, heretofore by mine enemies falsly surmised : and being desirous to come to the triall thereof, whereby to justifie my true dealings, and to reproove my sayd enemies as well here as there, who have not ceased of late by untrue reports to impute the cause of the sayd Emperors displeasure towards you to proceed of my dealings, and promises made to him at my last being with him (although by his letters to the Queenes Majestie, and by his owne words to me the contrary doeth appeare) I determined with my selfe rather to put my life into his hands, & by the providence of God to prosecute the charge committed unto me, then to returne home in vaine, discouraged with the words of such, who had rather that I had taried at home, then to be sent over with such credite, whereby I might sift out their evil doings, the onely cause of your losse.
Wherefore, leaving the said ships the nine and twentieth  day of the moneth, I departed from the seaside, and the first of August arrived at Colmogro, where I remained attending the returne of my said messenger with order from his Majestie.
But all the Countrey being sore visited by the hand of God with the plague, passage in every place was shut up, that none might passe in paine of death: My messenger being eight hundreth miles upon his way, was stayed, and kept at a towne called Shasko, and might not bee suffered to goe any further, neither yet to returne
171
backe againe, or sende unto me : by meanes wnereof in the space of foure moneths, I could neither heare nor know what was become of him, in which time my said messenger found meanes to advertise the Governour of the Ci tie of Vologda, as well of his stay, as of the cause of his comming thither, who sent him word that it was not possible to passe any neerer the Prince without further order from his Majestie, who was gone to the warres against the Swethens, and that he would advertise his highnesse as soone as he might conveniently : And so my said messenger was forced to remaine there still without answere. During which time of his stay through the great death (as aforesaid,) I found meanes to send another messenger, with a guide by an un-knowen way through wildernesse, a thousand miles about, thinking that way he should passe without let: but it prooved contrary, for likewise hee being passed a great part of his journey, fell into the handes of a watch, and escaped very hardly, that hee and his guide with their horses had not bene burnt, according to the lawe provided for such as would seeke to passe by indirect wayes, and many have felt the smart thereof which had not wherewith to buy out the paine : neither could that messenger returne backe unto me.
And thus was I kept without answere or order from his Majestie, and remained at the saide Colmogro, untill the 18. of January following, neither having a Gentleman to safegard me, nor lodging appointed me, nor allowance of victuals according to the Countrey fashion for Ambassadours, which argued his grievous displeasure towards our nation. And the people of the Countrey perceiving the same, used towards mee and my company some discourtesies : but about the 28. day aforesaid, the plague ceased, and the passages being opened, there came order from his Majestie that I should have poste horses, and bee suffered to depart from Colmogro to goe to a Citie called Peraslave neere to the Court, his Majestie being newly returned from the said warres.
172
And I arrived at the said Peraslave the 3. of February, where I remained under the charge of a gentleman, having then a house appointed me, & allowance of victuals, but so straitly kept, that none of our nation or other might come or sende unto me, nor I to them. And the 14. of March folowing, I was sent for to the Court, and being within three miles of the same, a poste was sent to the Gentleman which had charge of me, to returne backe againe with mee to the said Peraslave, and to remaine there untill his Majesties further pleasure, wherewith I was much dismayed, and marveiled what that sudden change ment, and the rather, because it was a troublesome time, and his Majestie much disquieted through the ill successe of his affaires, (as I did understand.) And the twentieth of the same, I was sent for againe to the Court, and the 23. I came before his Majestie, who caused mee to kisse his hande, and gave gratious audience unto my Oration, gratefully receiving and accepting the Queenes Majesties princely letters, and her present, in the presence of all his nobilitie. After I had finished my Oration, too long here to rehearse, and delivered her highnesse letters, and present (as aforesaid) the Emperour sitting in royall estate stood up and said, How doth Queene Elizabeth my sister, is she in health ? to whom I answered, God doth blesse her Majestie with health, and peace, and doeth wish the like unto thee Lord, her loving brother. Then his Majestie sitting downe againe, commaunded all his nobilitie and others to depart, and avoyde the chamber, saving the chiefe Secretarie, and one other of the Counsell, and willing me to approch neere unto him with my Interpretor, said unto me these words.
Anthony, the last time thou wast with us heere, wee did commit unto thee our trustie and secret Message, to be declared unto the Queenes Majestie herselfe thy Mistresse at thy comming home, and did expect thy comming unto us againe at the time wee appointed, with a full answere of the same from her highnesse.
173
And in the meane time there came unto us at several! times three messengers, the one called Manly, the other George Middleton, and Edward Goodman, by the way of the Narve about the Merchants affaires : to whom wee sent our messenger to know whether thou Anthony, were returned home in safetie, and when thou shouldest returne unto us againe: but those messengers could tell us nothing, and did miscall, and abuse with evil words, both our messenger and thee, wherewith wee were much offended. And understanding that the said Goodman had letters about him, we caused him to be searched, with whom were found many letters, wherein was written much against our Princely estate, and that in our Empire were many unlawfull things done, whereat we were much grieved, & would suffer none of those rude messengers to have accesse unto us : and shortly after wee were infourmed that one  Thomas Randolfe was come into our Dominions by the way of Dwina, Ambassadour from the Queene, and we sent a Gentleman to meete and conduct him to our Citie of Mosco, at which time we looked that thou shouldest have returned unto us againe. And the said Thomas being arrived at our said Citie, wee sent unto him divers times, that hee should come and conferre with our Counsel!, whereby we might understand the cause of his comming, looking for answere of those our princely affaires committed unto thee. But hee refused to come to our said Counsell: wherefore, and for that our saide Citie was visited with plague, the saide Thomas was the longer kept from our presence. Which being ceased, foorthwith wee gave him accesse and audience, but all his talke with us was about Merchants affaires, and nothing touching ours. Wee knowe that Merchants matters are to bee heard, for that they are the stay of our Princely treasures : But first Princes affaires are to be established, and then Merchants. After this the said Thomas Randolfe was with us at our Citie of Vologda, and wee dealt with him about our Princely affaires, 174
whereby amitie betwixt the Queenes Majestie and us might bee established for ever, and matters were agreed and concluded betwixt your Ambassadour and us, and thereupon wee sent our Ambassadour into England with him to ende the same : but our Ambassadour returned unto us againe, without finishing our said affaires, contrary to our expectation, and the agreement betwixt us, and your said Ambassadour.
Thus when his Majestie had made a long discourse, I humbly beseeched his highnesse to heare me graciously, and to give me leave to speake without offence, and to beleeve those wordes to be true which I should speake. Which he graunted, and these were my words.
Most noble and famous Prince, the message which thy highnesse did sende by mee unto the Queene her most excellent Majestie touching thy Princely and secret affaires, immediatly, and so soone as I came home, I did declare both secretly and truely unto the Queenes Majestie her selfe, word for word, as thou Lord diddest commaund mee. Which her highnesse did willingly heare and accept, and being mindefull thereof, and willing to answere the same, the next shipping after, her Majestie did sende unto thee, Lord, her highnesse Ambassadour Thomas Randolfe, whose approoved wisedome and fidelitie was unto her Majestie well knowen, and therefore thought meete to bee sent to so worthy a Prince, who had Commission not onely to treate with thy Majestie of Merchants affaires, but also of those thy Princely and secret affaires committed unto mee. And the cause (most gracious Prince) that I was not sent againe, was, for that I was imployed in service upon the Seas against the Queenes Majesties enemies, and was not returned home at such time as Master Thomas Randolfe departed with the Shippes, to come into thy Majesties Countrey, otherwise I had bene sent. And whereas thy Majestie saith, that Thomas Randolfe would not treate with thy Counsell of the matters of his Legation, hee did (Lord) therein according to his Com-175
mission : which was : First to deale with thy Majestie thy selfe, which order is commonly used among all Princes, when they send their Ambassadours about matters of great waight. And whereas the saide Thomas is charged that hee agreed and concluded upon matters at the same time, and promised the same should bee perfourmed by the Queene her Majestie : Whereupon (Lord) thou diddest send thy Ambassadour with him into England, for answere thereof: It may please thy Majestie to understand, that as the saide Thomas Randolfe doeth confesse, that in deede hee had talke with thy Highnesse, and counsell divers times about princely affaires : even so hee denieth that ever hee did agree, conclude, or make any promise in any condition or order, as is alleaged, otherwise then it should please the Queene her Majestie to like of at his returne home, which hee did justifie to thy Highnes Ambassador his face in England. Wherefore, most mighty Prince, it doth well appeare, that either thy Ambassador did untruly enforme thy Majestie, or els thy princely minde, and the true meaning of the Queenes highnes her Ambassador, for want of a good Interpretor, was not well understood: and how thankefully the Queene her Majestie did receive thy highnes commendations, and letters sent by thy Majesties Ambassador, and how gratiously shee gave him audience sundry times, using him with such honour in all points for thy sake, Lord, her loving brother, as the like was never shewed to any Ambassador in our Realme, and how honourably with full answere in all things, her Majestie dismissed him, when hee had finished all thy princely affaires (as it seemed) to his owne contentation, it may well appeare by a true certificate lately sent with her highnes letter unto thee Lord, by her messenger Robert Beast, and her Majestie did suppose that that thy Ambassador would have made report accordingly, and that by him thy highnes would have bene satisfied in all things: otherwise she would have sent her Majesties Ambassador with
176
him unto thee Lord againe. But now her highnes perceiving that thy Majestie is not fully satisfied in thy Princely affaires, neither by Thomas Randolfe, her highnes Ambassador, nor by thine owne Ambassador Andrea -AndrewSavin Savin, nor yet by her Majesties letter sent by the said -Ambauadour Andrea: and also understanding thy great griefe and 6 displeasure towards sir William Garret, and his company,  merchants traffiking in thy Majesties dominions, hath thought good to send mee at this present unto thee Lord Emperor, and great duke, as wel with her highnes fill mind, touching thy princely aflaires, as also to know the just cause of thy Majesties said displeasure towards the said company of merchants : and hath commanded me to answere to all things in their behalfe, and according to their true meanings. For her highnes doth suppose thy Majesties indignation to proceede rather upon the evill, and untrue reports of thy late Ambassador in England, and of such wicked persons of our nation resident here in thy highnes dominions, rebels to her Majestie, and their Countrey, then of any just deserts of the said merchants, who never willingly deserved thy highnesse displeasure, but rather favour in all their doings and meanings. And since the first time of their trafiik-ing in thy Majesties dominions, which is now nineteene yeres, the said merchants have bene, and are alwayes ready and willing truely to serve thy highnesse of all things meete for thy Treasurie, in time of peace and of warre in despite of all thy enemies : although the Princes of the East Seas were agreed to stoppe the sound, and the way to the Narve, and have brought, and do bring from time to time such commoditie to thee, Lord, as her Majestie doeth not suffer to be transported foorth of her Realme to no other Prince of the world. And what great losses the said sir William Garret, with his company hath sustained of late yeeres in this trade, as well by Shipwracke, as by false servants it is manifestly knowen : and what service the said companies Ships did unto thy Majestie against thy enemies, two yeeres past
III	177	M
in going to the Narve, when they fought with the king of Poles shippes Freebooters, and burnt the same and slew the people, and as many as were taken alive delivered unto thy Captaine at the Narve, I trust thy highnesse doth not forget. Wherefore most mighty prince, the premises considered, the Queene her most excellent Majestie thy loving sister, doeth request thy highnes to restore the said sir William Garret with his company into thy princely favour againe, with their priviledges for free traffique with thy accustomed goodnes and justice, to be ministred unto them throughout all thy Majesties dominions, as aforetime: and that the same may be signified by thy Princely letters, directed to thy officers in all places, and thy highnesse commaundement or restraint to the contrary notwithstanding. And further that it will please thy Majestie, not to give credite to false reports, and untrue suggestions of such as are enemies, and such as neither would have mutuall amitie to continue betwixt your Majesties, nor yet entercourse betwixt your countries. And such rebels of our nation, as Ralfe Rutter, and others which lye lurking here in thy highnes dominions, seeking to sowe dissentions betwixt your Majesties by false surmises, spending away their masters goods riotously, and will not come home to give up their accompts, advancing themselves to be merchants, and able to serve thy highnes of all things fit for thy treasurie, whereas indeed they be of no credite, nor able of themselves to do thy Majestie any service at all: the Queenes highnes request is, that it would please thy Majestie to commaund that such persons may be delivered unto me to be caried home, least by their remayning here, and having practises and friendship with such as be not thy highnesse friendes, their evil doing might be a cause hereafter to withdraw thy goodnes from sir William Garret and his company, who have true meaning in all their doings, and are ready to serve thy highnesse at all times, using many other words to the advancement of your credits, 178
and the disgracing of your enemies, and so I ended for that time.
Then sayd his Majestie, We have heard you, and will consider of all things further, when wee have read the Queene our sisters letters: to whom I answered, that I supposed his Majestie should by those letters understand her highnesse full minde to his contentation, and what wanted in writing, I had credite to accomplish in word. Wherewith his Majestie seemed to be wel pleased, and commaunded me to sit downe. And after pawsing a while, his Majestie said these words unto me, It is now a time which we spend in fasting, and praying, being the weeke before Easter, and for that we will shortly depart from hence, towards our borders of Novo-grod, wee can not give you answere, nor your dispatch here, but you shall goe from hence, and tary us upon the way, where wee will shortly come, and then you shall knowe our pleasure, and have your dispatch. And so I was dismissed to my lodging, and the same day I had a dinner ready drest sent me from his Majestie, with great store of drinkes, of divers sorts, and the next day following, being the foure and twentieth of March aforesayde, the chiefe Secretary to his Majesty, sent unto mee a Gentleman, to signifie unto mee, that the Emperours Majesties pleasure was, I should immediatly depart towards a Citie, called Otwer, three hundred miles from the aforesaid Sloboda, and there to tary his highnes comming unto a place called Staryts, three score miles from the sayd Otwer.
Then I sent my Interpretor to the chiefe Secretary, requesting him to further, and shew his favour unto our saide merchants in their sutes, which they should have occasion to move in my absence: who sent me  word againe, that they should be wel assured of his friendship, and furtherance in all their sutes. And forthwith post horses were sent me, with a Gentleman to conduct me. And so departing from the said Sloboda, I arrived at the said Otwer, the 28. of March aforesaid,
179
where I remained til the eight of May folowing. Then I was sent for to come unto his Majestie, to the said Staryts, where I arrived the tenth of the same, and the twelfth of the same I was appointed to come to the chiefe Secretary, who at our meeting said unto me these words.
Our Lord Emperor, and great Duke, hath not onely perused the Queene her highnes letters sent by you, and thereby doeth perceive her minde, as well touching their princely affaires, as also her earnest request in the merchants behalfe, but also hath well pondered your words. And therefore his Majesties pleasure is, that you let me understand what sutes you have to move in the merchants behalfe, or otherwise, for that to morrowe you shall have accesse againe unto his highnes, and shall have full answere in all things, with your dispatch away.
Then after long conference had with him of divers matters I gave him in writing certaine briefe articles of requests, which I had drawen out ready, as foloweth:
i First the Queenes Majestie her request is, that it would please the Emperors highnesse to let me know the just cause of his great displeasure fallen upon sir William Garrard, & his company, who never deserved the same, to their knowledge.
2	Also that it would please his highnes not to give credite unto false and untrue reports, by such as seeke to sowe dissention, and breake friendship betwixt the Queenes highnesse, and his Majestie.
3	Also that it would please his Majestie to receive the said sir William Garrard, with his company into his favour againe, and to restore them to their former privi-ledges and liberties, for free traffike in, and through, and out of al his Majesties dominions, in as ample maner as aforetime, according to his princely letters of privi-ledge, and accustomed goodnes.
4	Also it would please his highnes to graunt, that the said company of merchants may have justice of all
180
his subjects, as well for money owing unto them, as other their griefes and injuries, throughout al his dominions suffred since the time of his displeasure, during which time, the merchants were forced by severe justice to answer to al mens demands, but theirs could not be heard.
5	Also that his Majestie would understand, that much debts are owing to the said merchants, by divers of his Nobilitie, whereof part are in durance, and some executed, and the said merchants know not howe to be paide, and answered the same, except his highnes pitie their case, and commaund some order to be taken therein.
6	Also it would please his highnes to commaund that the saide merchants may be payde all such summe or summes of money as are owing, and due unto them by his Majestie, for wares, as well English, as Shamaki, taken into his highnes treasury by his officers in sundry places, the long forbearing whereof hath bene, and is great hinderance to the said company of merchants.
7	Also it would please his Majestie to understand, that at this present time there are in Persia of English merchants, Thomas Banister, and Geffrey Ducket, with their company, & goods, ready to come into his Majesties countrey of Astracan, and would have come the last yeere, but that the ship, with our merchants and mariners appointed to goe for them, were stayed at Astracan by his highnes Captaine there, to the great hinderance of the said merchants. Wherefore it may now please his Majestie to direct his princely letters unto his Captaines and rulers, both at Astracan and Cazan, not onely to suffer our people, as well merchants as mariners, quietly and freely to passe and repasse with their shippes, barkes, or other vessels downe the river Volga, and over the Mare Caspium, to fetch the sayd English merchants, with their company and goods, out of the sayd Persia, into his Majesties dominions, but also that it would please his highnes streightly to 181
command, that when the sayd Thomas Banister, and Geffrey Ducket, with their charge, shal arrive at the sayd Astracan, his Majesties Captaine there, and in all other places upon the river Volga, shall so ayde and assist the sayd merchants, as they may be safely conducted out of the danger of the Crimmes, and other their enemies.
8	Also it may please his highnes to understand, that lately our merchants comming from Shamaki, have bene ill used by his Majesties Customers, both at Astracan and Cazan, at both which places they were forced to pay custome for their wares, although they solde no part thereof, but brought the same into his highnesse treasury at Sloboda : and the sayd Customers did not only exact, and take much more custome then was due by his Majesties lawes, but also for want of present money, tooke wares much exceeding their exacted custome, and doe keepe the same as a pawne. It may therefore please his highnes to direct his princely letters to the said Customers, to signifie unto them his great goodnes againe restored unto the said English merchants, as also to command them to send the said merchants their said goods so detained, up to the  Mosco, they paying such custome for the same, as shall be by his Majestie appointed.
9	Also that it would please his highnesse to grant, that sir William Garrard with his companie may establish their trade for merchandise at Colmogro in Dwina, and that such wares as shal be brought out of our Countrey fit for his treasurie might be looked upon, and received by his officers there : and that his Majesties people traffiking with our merchants may bring downe their commodities to the saide Colmogro, by meanes whereof the saide English merchants avoyding great troubles and charges, in transporting their goods so farre, and into so many places of his dominions, may sell the same better cheape, to the benefite of his Majesties subjects.
182
io Also if it seemed good to his highnes, that the whole trade likewise from Persia, Boghar, and all other those Countreys beyond the Mare Caspium, might be established at Astracan, the ancient Marte towne in times past, which would be both for the great honour and profite of his Majesty, and subjects, as I am well able to proove, if it will please his highnesse to appoint any of his counsell to talke with me therein.
ii Also forasmuch as it pleased his Majestie, im-mediatly after the burning of the Mosco, to command that the said English merchants should give in a note into his Treasury, for their losses sustained by the said fire, which was done by William Rowly, then chiefe Agent for sir William Garrard and his company, and the particulars in the same note consumed with the said fire did amount to the summe of 10000. rubbles and above : It may please his highnes of his accustomed goodnes and great clemencie to consider of the same, and to give the said company so much as shal seeme good unto his Majestie, towards their said losses.
12 Also that it will please his highnesse to understand that the Queenes most excellent Majestie, at the earnest sute and request of Andrea Savin his Majesties Ambassadour, did not onely pardon and forgive Thomas Glover his great and grievous offences towards her highnesse committed, onely for his Majesties sake, but also commanded sir William Garrard with his company, to deale favourably with the said Glover in his accompts, to whom he was indebted greatly, and being their servant, detained their goods in his hands a long time : whereupon the said sir William Garrard with his company counted with the said Glover, and ended all things even to his saide contentation, and was found to bee debter to the said company 4000. rubbles and above, and bound himselfe both by his solemne othe, and his hand-writing, to pay the same immediatly after his returne into Russia with the said Andrea Savin, unto Nicholas Proctor chiefe Agent there, for the said com-183
pany of merchants. But although it is now two yeeres past, since the said agreement, and that the said Nicholas hath divers and sundry times requested the said money of the said Thomas, yet will he not pay the same debt, but maketh delay from time to time, alleadging that his Majestie oweth him a great summe of money, without the payment whereof he cannot be able to pay the said merchants his due debt long forborne, to their great hinderance. In consideration of the premisses, It may please his highnesse to give order that the said Glover may be payd, and that he may discharge his debt to the said company of merchants, and the rather for that hee found such mercie and favour in England, onely for his Majesties sake.
13	Also forasmuch as Ralfe Rutter a rebell to the Queenes Majestie, and an enemie to his Countrey, and to sir William Garrard and his company, hath of long time remained here, living of the spoyles and goods of the said merchants, which he wrongfully detained in his handes, riotously spending the same, during the time that he was their servant, and would not come home when he was sent for, and also for that the Queenes Majestie doth understand, that the said Ralfe, with other his adherents, doe seeke by all false meanes to sowe dissention, and breake amitie betwixt their Majesties, and to overthrowe the trade of the said merchants : Her highnes request is, that the said Ralfe with his complices may be delivered unto me, to be caried home, and none other of her Majesties subjects, not being of the societie of the said Sir William Garrard and his company, to be suffered to traffike within his highnes dominions, but to be delivered to their Agent to bee sent home : for that the said merchants with great charges and losses, both by shipwracke, and riotous servants, did first finde out this trade, and have continued the same these 19. yeeres, to their great hinderance.
14	Also whereas divers masters and artificers of our 184
Nation are here in his Majesties service, and do finde themselves grieved that they cannot have licence to depart home into their native Countrey at their will and pleasure : the Queenes Majesties request is, according to her highnes writing in that behalfe, that not onely it will please his Majestie to permit and suffer such artificers here resident in the service of his highnes, to have free libertie to depart, and go home with me, if they request the same, but also all other the like, which shall come hereafter to serve his Majesty, to have free libertie to depart likewise, without any let or stay.
15	Also it may please his Majesty to understand that during the time of my long being at Colmogro,  attending his highnesse pleasure for my further accesse, I with my company have not onely bene ill used and intreated there, and likewise the merchants there, by one Besson Mysserevy his Majesties chiefe officer, who hath dishonoured me, and smitten my people, and oweth the saide merchants much money, and will not pay them : but also the saide Besson hath spoken wordes of dishonour against the Queenes Majestie. Wherefore it may please his highnesse to send downe with me to Colmogro, a Gentleman, as well chiefly to search foorth his evill behaviour towards her Majestie, as towards me her highnesse Ambassador, and to punish him accordingly: and also that it would please his Majestie to sende downe his letter of justice, by vertue whereof the said Besson may be forced to pay all such money as he oweth to the sayd merchants, without delay.
16	Also that it would please his highnesse to understand, that sir William Garrard with his company understanding of the great dearth in his Majesties dominions, by licence of the Queens Majestie, (not otherwise permitted) hath sent certaine ships laden with corne into his highnesse Countrey of Dwyna, rather for the reliefe of his Majesties subjects, then for any gaine : yet the good wil of the said merchants lightly regarded, they were forbidden to sei the said corne, to their great discouragers
ment hereafter to send any more. Wherefore it may please his highnesse, to tender the good will of the said merchants, as well in sending the saide corne, as in all other things, ready to serve his Majestie, and to direct his letters to his officers of Dwina, to suffer the saide merchants with their company, to sell the said corne by measure, great or small at their pleasure, without paying custome.
These articles being delivered to the chiefe Secretary, as aforesayde, and our talke ended for that time, I departed to my lodging, accompanied with certaine Gentlemen. The next day, being the 13. of May aforesaid, I had warning earely in the morning, to prepare my selfe to be at the Court, betwixt the houres of 10. and 11. of the clocke, where I should have accesse unto the presence of the Prince, as well to receive answere of all things, as to bee dismissed to goe home. At which houres I was sent for to the Court, and brought into the Chamber of presence, where his Majestie did sit apparelled most sumptuously, with a riche Crowne upon his head, garnished with many pretious stones, his eldest sonne sitting by him, and many of his Nobili tie about him : and after my duetie done, his highnesse commanded me to approch very neere unto him, and sayde unto me these wordes.
Anthony, the Queene our loving sister her letters wee have caused to be translated, and doe well understand the same, and of all things as well therein contained, as by worde of mouth by you to us declared wee have well considered, and doe perceive that our secret message unto you committed, was done truely according to our minde (although wee were advertised to the contrary) and nowe wee are by you fully satisfied. And when wee did sende our Ambassadour into England, about those our great and waightie affaires, to conclude the same with the Queene our sister, our Ambassadour coulde ende nothing for want of such assurance as was requisite in princely affaires, according to the maner of all Countreys, but was 186
ANTHONY JENKINSON dismissed unto us againe, with letters of small effect, touching the same, and no Ambassadour sent with him from the Queene : which caused us to thinke, that our princely affaires were set aside, and little regarded, wherewith wee were at that time much grieved : for the which cause, and for the evill behaviour of your merchants, resident in our dominions (who have divers wayes transgressed and broken our lawes, living wilfully in al their doings) we did lay our heavie displeasure upon them, and did take away from them their priviledge, commaunding that the same throughout all our dominions, should be voyd, and of none effect: and thereupon did write to the Queene our sister, touching our griefes.
And nowe her highnesse hath sent unto us againe, you her Ambassadour, with her loving letters, and full minde, which we doe thankefully receive, and are thereby fully satisfied. And for that our princely, and secret affaires were not finished to our contentation at our time appointed, according to our expectation, we doe now leave of all those matters, and set them aside for the time, because our minde is nowe otherwise changed, but hereafter when occasion shall moove us to the like, wee will then talke of those matters againe. And for that it hath pleased the Queene our loving sister, to sende unto us at this present, and doeth desire to continue in friendship with us for ever (which wee doe gratefully accept, and willingly agree to the same) wee of our goodnesse for her highnesse sake, will not onely from hencefoorth put away, and forget all our displeasure towardes the same Sir William Garrard and his company (as though they had never offended us) but also will restore them to their priviledges, and liberties, in, and throughout all our dominions, and will signifie the same by our letters, in all Townes and Cities, where the said merchants do traffique, and we will shewe them favour as aforetime, if they deserve not the contrary. And if the Queene our sister had not sent thee Anthony unto us at this present, God knoweth what we should have done to the said

The causes of the Emperors displeasure.
merchants, or whether we would have called back our indignation.
Then I humbly beseeched his Majestie, to let me know the particular offences committed by the said merchants, and the offenders names, to the intent I might make report thereof, unto the Queenes Majestie, my mistres, accordingly, that the said offenders might receive just punishments for their deserts : but he said, I should not know them, because he had cleerely remitted al offences : and further, that it was not princely to forgive, and after to accuse the parties, whereby her Majesties displeasure might fall upon them at home. Notwithstanding I did after understand some part thereof, by other meanes.
Then his Majestie proceeding in talke, said: As touching the articles of request, concerning the marchants affaires, which you did yesterday deliver unto our Secretary, we have not onely read the same our selfe, but also have appointed our said Secretary to declare unto you our mind, and answere to the same. And for that we are now upon our journey towards our borders, and will depart from hence shortly, we will dismisse you to ye Queene our loving sister, your mistres, with our letters, & full mind by word of mouth, touching all your requests, & will send a gentleman one of our houshold with you to safe conduct you to your ships : and of our goodnes will give you victuals, boates, men, and post horses, so many as you shall neede. And therewith his Majestie standing up, and putting off his cappe, said unto me these words. Doe our hearty commendations unto our loving sister, Queene Elizabeth, unto whom we wish long life, with happie successe: and therewith his highnes extended his hand to me to kisse, and commanded his sonne, sitting by him, to send the like commendations, which he did, whose hand likewise I kissed. And then his Majestie caused me to sit downe, and commaunded wine and drinkes of divers sorts to be brought, whereof he gave me to drinke with his owne hand, and so after 1 departed.
188
Then the next day, being the 14 of May aforesaid, I was sent for to come to the chief Secretary, & one other of the counsel with him, who at our meeting said unto me these words : We are appointed by the Emperor his majesty, to give you answere from his Highnes, touching your requests delivered in writing, which his Majestie himselfe hath perused, & answered as followeth.
1	To the first request it is answered, that all his Majesties griefes and displeasure (now put away from the merchants) did grow, because the Queenes Majestie did not accomplish and ende with his ambassador, his secrete and waighty affaires, according to his expectation, and the promise made by Thomas Randolph, at his being here : and also of the ill behaviour of your merchants resident here in our Countrey, as his Majestie did himselfe yesterday declare unto you.
2	To the second, his Majesty willeth you to understand, that he hath not, nor will not hereafter be moved to breake friendship with the Queenes Majesty, without good and just cause.
3	To the third, you are answered by the Emperors Majestie himselfe, that his great goodnes and favour againe unto the merchants shall be restored, and the same to be knowen by his gratious letters of privilege now againe granted.
4	To the fourth, his majesty hath commanded, that your merchants here resident shall exhibite, and put in writing unto me his Majesties Secretarie, all their griefes, and complaints, as well for debts, as other injuries ofired them since the time of his Highnes displeasure, and they shall have justice truly ministred throughout all his Majesties dominions without delay.
5	To the fifth, his majesty doth not know of any debts due unto the merchants, by any of his Noblemen, as is alleaged : and whether it be true or no, he knoweth not: the trueth whereof must be tried out, and thereupon answere to be given : and hereafter his majestie would not have the merchants to trust his people with too much.
189
6	To the sixth, it is answered, that his majesty hath commanded search to be made what money is owing to the marchants, for wares received into his treasury, as in the article: (the most of the bookes of accompt being burnt in the Mosco) and such as is due, & found meete to be paid, shall be paid forthwith to the marchants, their factors or servants, which shall come for the same. And for paiment of the rest, his majesties further pleasure shall be signified hereafter.
7	To the 7 his Majesties answere is, that letters shall be written forthwith to his captaines of Astracan, and Cazan, and other his officers, upon the river Volga, to whom it appertaineth, not onely to suffer your people, both marchants, & mariners, to passe with their ships, or barkes, from Astracan, over the Mare caspium, to fetche Thomas Banister, and Geofry Ducket, with their company, and goods out of Persia, but also when they shall arrive within his Majesties dominions, to aide and assist them, and see them safely conducted up the river Volga, from danger of enemies.
8	To the eight, his majestie hath commanded letters to be written to the Customers, both of Astracan and Cazan, to make restitution to the English merchants of their goods so deteined by them for custome, & to take  custome for the same, according to his Majesties letters of privilege.
9	10 To the ninth and tenth articles, his Majestie will consider of those matters, and hereafter will signifie his princely pleasure therein.
11	To the eleventh, as touching an inventorie given into the treasury, what goods the merchants had burnt in the Mosco, in their houses there, his Majesties pleasure was to understande the same, to the intent he might know the losses of all strangers at that present, but not to make restitution, for that it was Gods doing, and not the Emperours.
12	To the twelfth, concerning Thomas Glover, his Majestie was enformed by his Ambassador of the
190
Queenes great mercy and clemencie towards the said Thomas, for his sake, which his Highnes received in good part, but what agreement or dealings was betwixt the said sir William Garrard, & his company, & the said Glover, or what he doth owe unto the said merchants, his Majestie doth not know. And as for the money which the said Thomas saith is owing unto him by the Emperour, his Majesties pleasure is, that so much as shall be found due, & growing upon wares delivered unto the treasurie, out of the time of his Majesties displeasure, shall be paid forthwith to the said Thomas, and the rest is forfeited unto his Majestie, and taken for a fine, as appertaining to Rutter and Bennet, accompted traitors unto his Highnes, during the time of his displeasure.
13	To the thirteenth article, concerning Rutter to be delivered unto you, to be caried home, the answere was, that as his Majestie will not detaine any English man in his Countrey, that is willing to go home, according to the Queenes request: even so will he not force any to depart, that is willing to tary with him. Yet his Highnes, to satisfie the Queenes Majesties request, is contented at this present to send the said Ralfe Rutter home with you, and hath commanded that a letter shall be written unto his chiefe officer at the Mosco, to send the said Rutter away with speed, that he may be with you at Vologda, by the fine of May, without faile : and touching the rest of your request in the said article, his Majesties pleasure shall be signified in the letters of privilege, granted to the said merchants.
14	To the fourteenth, touching artificers, his Majestie will accomplish all the Queenes Highnes request in that behalfe, and now at this present doth licence such and so many to depart to their native countrey as are willing to goe.
15	To the 15, touching Besson Messerivey, the Emperors majestie is much offended with him, and will send down a gentleman with you to inquire of his
191
ill behavior, aswel for speaking of undecent words against the Queens majestie as you have alleaged, as also against you, and the merchants for his outrages mentioned in the article, & the said Besson being found guilty, to be imprisoned & punished by severe justice accordingly, and after to put in sureties to answere the Emperors high displeasure, or els to be brought up like a prisoner by the said gentleman to answere his offences before his Majestie. And his highnes doth request that the Queenes highnes would doe the like upon Middleton and Manlie her messengers sent thither two yeres past, and of all others for their ill behaviour towards his majestie, as may appeare by letters sent by Daniel Silvester from his highnes, least by the bad demeanor of such lewd persons, the amity and friendship betwixt their majesties might be diminished.
16	To the 16 and last article, touching the corne brought into the Emperors dominions by the merchants, his majestie doth greatly commend them for so wel doing, and hath commanded to give you a letter forthwith in their behalf, directed to his officers of Duina, to suffer the said merchants to sell their corne, by measure great or small at their pleasure without custome.
Thus I received a full answere from his majestie by his chiefe Secretarie & one other of his counsel, to the 16 articles afore rehearsed, by me exhibited in writing touching your affaires, with his letter also sent by me to the Queenes majesty. Which being done, I requested that the new letters of privilege granted by his highnes unto you might be forthwith dispatched, to the intent I might carie the same with me. Also I requested that such money due to you, which it had pleased his majesty to command to be payd, might be delivered to me in your behalfe.
Touching the letters of privilege, the Secretary answered me, it is not possible you can have them with you, for they must be first written and shewed unto the Emperor, and then three to be written of one
192
tenour according to your request, which cannot bee done with speede, for that his majesties pleasure is, you shall depart this night before him, who remooveth himselfe to morrow towards Novogrod : but without fade the sayd letters shall be dispatched upon the way, and sent after you with speede to Colmogro. And as touching the money which you require, it cannot be paid here because we have not the bookes of accounts, for want whereof we know not what to paie : wherfore the best is that you send one of the merchants after the Emperor to Novogrod, & let him repaire unto me there, and without fade I will paie all such money as shall be appointed by his majestie to be paied after the bookes seene.
But forasmuch as there was none of your servants with  me at that present (although I had earnestly written unto your Agent Nicholas Proctor by Richard Pingle one of your owne servants, one moneth before my comming to Starites, where I had my dispatch, that he should not fade to come himselfe, or send one of your servants to mee hither, to follow all such sutes as I should commence in your behalfs, which he neglected to doe to your great hinderance) I requested the said Secretarie that I might leave Daniel my interpreter with him, aswel for the receit of money, as for the speedy dispatch of the letters of priviledge, but it would not be granted in any wise that I should leave any of mine own companie behind me, and thereupon I did take my leave with full dispatch, and departed to my lodging, and foorthwith there came unto me a gentleman who had charge as wel to conduct me, and provide boates, men, post horses and victuals for me all the way to the sea side, being a thousand and three hundred miles, as also to doe justice of the sayd Bessone, as aforesaid. And he said unto me, the Emperours pleasure is, that you shall presently depart from hence, and I am appointed to goe with you. And that night I departed from the said Starites, being the fourteenth of May aforesayd.
in	193	N
And passing a great part of my journey, I arrived at the citie of Vologda the last of the sayd May, where I remained five daies as well expecting a messenger to bring unto me the new letters of priviledge, as the comming of Rutter, whom the Emperours majestie himselfe commanded before my face should bee sent unto me without fade, and I did see the letters written to the chiefe officers at the Mosco for the same. Neverthelesse the said Rutter did not come, neither could I heare of him after, nor know the sudden cause of his stay contrary to the princes owne word and meaning, as I suppose. But I could not help the matter being farre from the prince, neither could I tell how to have redresse, because by absence I could not complaine. Notwithstanding I used my indevour, and sent a messenger John Norton one of your servants from Vologda to Novogrod, where the court then lay, expressely with letters, as well to advertise his majestie that the sayd Rutter was not sent unto me according to his highnes commandement & order, as also about the dispatch of the said letters of priviledge and receit of your money, with straight charge that he should in any wise returne unto me againe before the departing of the ships. And the first day of June I departed from the said Vologda by water towards Colmogro, where I arrived the 21 of June aforesaid, and remained there untill the 23 of July, looking for the said John Norton to have returned unto me in al that time, which had respite fully enough in that space both to go to the court to dispatch his busines, and to have returned againe unto me, but he came not, for it was otherwise determined before his going, as I did after understand, and can more at large by worde of mouth declare unto your worships the occasion thereof.
Neverthelesse, I am well assured before this time your Agent hath received into his hands the sayd letters of priviledges, and shall have dispatch with expedition in all things touching your affaires, according to his majesties
194
grant by me obtained, and as he hath written to the Queenes majestie at this present, wishing that as now by my going the Emperour hath withdrawen his grievous displeasure from you, and restored you againe into his favour, so your Agent and others your servants there resident may behave, & endevour themselves to keepe & augment the same, whose evill doings have bene the onely occasion of his indignation now remitted.
