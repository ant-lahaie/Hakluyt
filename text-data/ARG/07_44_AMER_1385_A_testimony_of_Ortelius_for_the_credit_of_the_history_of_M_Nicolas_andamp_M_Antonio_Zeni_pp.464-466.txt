A Nd here I shall not (as I suppose) commit any great inconvenience, or absurditie, in adding unto this History of the new world, certaine particulars as touching the first discovery therof, not commonly known. Which discoverie al the writers of our time ascribe (& that not unworthily) unto Christopher Columbus. For by him it was in a maner first discovered, made knowen, and profitably communicated unto the Christian world, in the yeere of our Lord 1492. Howbeit I finde that the North part thereof called Estotiland, (which most of all extendeth toward our Europe and the Islands of the same, namely, Groneland, Island, and Frisland,) was long ago found out by certaine fishers of the Isle of Frisland, driven by tempest upon the shore thereof: and was afterward about the yeere 1390 discovered a new, by one Antonio Zeno a gentleman of Venice ; which sayled thither under the conduct of Zichmni king of the saide Isle of Frisland, a prince in those parts of great 464
NICHOLAS AND ANTONIO ZENO a.d. c. 1380-90. valour, and renowned for his martiall exploits and victories. Of which expedition of Zichmni there are extant in Italian certaine collections or abridgements gathered by Francisco Marcolino out of the letters of M. Nicolo and Antonio Zeni two gentlemen of Venice which lived in those partes. Out of which collections I doe adde concerning the description of Estotiland aforesaid these particulars following.
Estotiland (saith he) aboundeth with all things necessary for mankinde. In the mids thereof standeth an exceeding high mountaine, from which issue foure rivers that moisten all the countrie. The inhabitants are wittie and most expert in all Mechanicall arts. They have a kinde of peculiar language and letters. Howbeit in this Kings Librarie are preserved certaine Latine bookes, which they understand not, being perhaps left there not many yeeres before by some Europeans, which traffiqued thither. They have all kinde of mettals; but especially golde, wherewith they mightily abound. They trafficke with the people of Groneland: from whence they fetch skinnes, pitch and brimstone. The inhabitants report that towardes the South, there are regions abounding with gold, and very populous: they have many and huge woods, from whence they take timber for the building of ships and cities, whereof and of castles there are great store. The use of the loadstone for Navigation is unknowen unto them. They make relation also of a certaine region toward the South, called Drogio, which Drogio. is inhabited by Canibals, unto whom mans flesh is delicate meat: wherof being destitute they live by fishing, which they use very much. Beyond this are large regions, and as it were a newe world: but the people are barbarous and goe naked: howbeit against the colde they cloth themselves in beastes skinnes. These have no kinde of metall: and they live by hunting. Their weapons are certaine long staves with sharpe points, and bowes. They wage warres one against another. They have governours, and obey certaine lawes. But from hence

more towardes the South the climate is much more temperate: and there are cities, and temples of idoles, unto whom they sacrifice living men, whose flesh they afterwards devoure. These nations have the use of silver and gold.
Thus much of this tract of landes out of the aforesaide collections or abridgements. Wherein this also is worthy the observation, that even then our Europaean Pilots sayled those seas by the helpe of the loadstone. For concerning the use thereof in Navigation, I suppose there is not to be found a more ancient testimonie. And these things I have annexed the rather unto this table of Mar del Zur; considering that none of those Authours which have written the Histories of the Newe world, have in any part of their writings, mentioned one word thereof. Hitherto Ortelius.
