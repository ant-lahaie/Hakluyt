The travaile of Robert Turneham.
[II. i. 39 ]
Obertus Turneham Franciscanus, Theologiae prong^ fessor insignis, Lynnae celebri Irenorum ad ripas ■- —I Isidis emporio, collegio suorum fratrum magnifice praefuit. Edwardus Princeps, cognomento Longus, Henrici tertii filius, bellicam expeditionem contra Sara
cenos Assyriam incolentes, anno Dom. 1268. parabat. Ad quam profectionem quaesitus quoque Orator vehemens, qui plebis in causa religionis animos excitaret, Turnehamus principi visus vel dignissimus est, qui munus hoc obiret. Sic tanquam signifer constitutus 366
1415-
Assyrios una cum Anglico exercitu petiit, ac suum non sine laude praestitit officium. Claruit anno salutiferi partus, 1280, varia componens, sub eodem Edwardo
ejus nominis primo post Conquestum.

RObert Turneham Franciscan, a notable professour of Divinity, was with great dignity Prior of the Coiledge of his Order in the famous Mart towne of Linne, situate upon the river of Isis in Norfolke. Prince Edward surnamed the Long, the sonne of Henry the third, prepared his warlike voyage against the Saracens dwelling in Syria, in the yeere of our Lord, 1268. For the which expedition some earnest preacher was sought to stir up the peoples minds in the cause of religion. And this Turneham seemed to the Prince most worthy to performe that office: so that he being appointed as it were a standerd bearer, went into Syria with the English army, and performed his duety with good commendation. He flourished in the yeere of Christ 1280, setting foorth divers works under the same king Edward the first of that name after the Conquest.
