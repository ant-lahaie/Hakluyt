A Testimonie of the learned Mathematician master John Dee, touching the foresaid voyage of Nicholas De Linna.
Nno 1360. (that is to wit, in the 34. yeere of the reigne of the triumphant king Edward the third) a frier of Oxford, being a good Astronomer, went in companie with others to the most Northren Islands of the world, and there leaving his company together, hee travailed alone, and
purposely described all the Northerne Islands, with the indrawing seas: and the record thereof at his returne he delivered to the king of England. The name of which booke is Inventio Fortunata (aliter fortunae) qui liber Inventio incipit a gradu 54. usque ad polum. Which frier for ^Â»rtunata-sundry purposes after that did five times passe from England thither, and home againe.
It is to be noted, that from the haven of Linne in Norfolke (whereof the foresaid Francisan frier tooke his 303
name) to Island, it is not above a fortnights sailing with an ordinarie winde, and hath bene of many yeeres a very common and usuall trade : which further appeareth by the privileges granted to the Fishermen of the towne of Blacknie in the said Countie of Norfolke, by king Edward the third, for their exemption and freedome from his ordinary service, in respect of their trade to Island.
