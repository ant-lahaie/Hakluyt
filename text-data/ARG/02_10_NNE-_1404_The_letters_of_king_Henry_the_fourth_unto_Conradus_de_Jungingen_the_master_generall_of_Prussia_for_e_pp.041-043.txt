The letters of king Henry the 4. unto Conradus de Jungingen the master general of Prussia, for mutual conversation and intercourse of traffique to continue between the marchants of England and of Prussia, for a certaine terme of time.
Enry by the grace of God, king of England & France, and lord of Ireland, to the noble and mighty personage of sacred religion, Frater Conradus de Jungingen Master general of the Order of the Dutch knights of S. Marie &c. our most deare and wel-beloved friend, greeting, and continuall increase of our
auncient and sincere amity. By the grievous complaynts of our liege subjects concerning traffique, as it were circularwise too & fro both our dominions, we have often
bene advertised that in regard of divers injuries and damages, which as well our as your marchants (who by their dealings in marchandise were woont peaceably to use mutual conversation together, whereupon very many commodities are knowen to have proceeded) have, by occasion of pirates, roving up and downe the sea, sometimes heretofore sustayned: both the sayd marchants of our & of your dominions do abstaine themselves from their wonted mutual conversation & traffique, as they have likewise carefully abstained at sometimes heretofore, and especially from that time, wherein at the instant request of your messengers, being of late before our presence, the free accesse of our marchants unto your territories and dominions, & of your marchants unto our realmes hath bene forbidden. Sithens therefore
The auncient friendship be-tweene England and Prussia.
(our most deare friend) such injuries (if any) as have bene attempted against your subjects, were never committed by our will and consent, as we thinke that your selfe on the other side have done the like: sithens also, so much as in us lieth, wee are ready to exhibit full justice with favour unto any of your people being desirous to make complaint, so that accordingly justice may equally be done unto our marchants by you & your subjects, which marchants have in like sort bene injuried, wishing with all our heart, that the ancient friendship & love, which hath continued a long time between our realme and your territories and dominions, may persevere in time to come, and that sweet and acceptable peace, which is to be embraced of al Christians, may according to the good pleasure of the author of peace, be nourished & mayn-tained: we do most heartily require the sayd friendship, exhorting you in the Lord that you would on your behalf consent & ordain (even as, if you shall so do, we for our part wil consent likewise) that from this present until the feast of Easter next insuing (al molestations & injuries which may be offred ceasing on both parts) our subjects by your territories & dominions, & your subjects by our realms, may peaceably & securely travel, & that according to their wonted maner, they may friendly converse & exercise mutual traffick together: because we are determined to send unto you & your counsel in the mean time some of our ambassadors, friendly to intreat about the foresaid pretended injuries, so far forth as they shal concerne our subjects. At whose arival we stand in good hope that by the due administration of justice on both parts, such order (by Gods assistance) shalbe taken, that mutual peace and tranquillity may be established between us in times to come. Also our desire is in particular, that our marchants & liege subjects may have more free passage granted them unto the parts of Sconia, for the providing of herrings and of other fishes there, that they may there remayne, and from thence also may more securely returne unto their owne home: and we
beseech you in consideration of our owne selves, that you would have our marchants and liege subjects especially recommended unto you, safely protecting them (if need shall require) under the shadow of your defence : even as you would have us to deale in the like case with your own subjects. Moreover, whatsoever you shall thinke good to put in practise in this behalfe, may it please you of your friendship, by our faythfull subject John Browne the bearer hereof to give us to understand. In the sonne of the glorious virgine fare ye well, with continuall prosperity and felicity according to your owne hearts desire. Given under our privie seale, at our palace of Westminster, the fift day of June, and in the fift yere of our reigne.
Postscriptum.
Right reverend and our most deare friend: albeit our welbeloved Arnold de Dassele the procurator of your foresaid messengers, being desirous at this time to make his final returne unto your parts, by reason of the afiayres, for which he hath remained in our realme of England, cannot as yet obtaine his wished expedition: notwithstanding you of your sincere affection ought not to marvel or any whit to be grieved thereat: because troubles of wars arising, which in some sort concerned our selves, and especially in regard of the continuall assaults of the French men & Britons against us and our king-dome, for the offence of whom, and our owne defence, our liege subjects (especially they, of whom your subjects damnified have made their complaints) have armed themselves to combate upon the sea: we could not grant unto the foresayd Arnold such and so speedy an expedition, as he earnestly desired to have. Unto the which Arnold your procurator we have offered in as short time as may be, to administer complete justice with favour, to ye end that for this cause he might dispose himselfe to remaine in our realme of England: & yet notwithstanding wee would do the very same even in the absence of the sayd procurator. Given as above.
