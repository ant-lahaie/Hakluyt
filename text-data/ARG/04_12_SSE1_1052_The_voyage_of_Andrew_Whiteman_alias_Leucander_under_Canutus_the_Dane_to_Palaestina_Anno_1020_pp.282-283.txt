The travailes of Andrew Whiteman alias Leu-cander, Centur. 2.
Ndrasas Leucander alias Whiteman (juxta Lelandum) Monachus, & Abbas Rame-siensis Caenobii tertius fuit. Hic bonis artibus studio quodam incredibili noctes atque dies invigilabat, & operae praecium ingens inde retulit. Accessit praeterea & ardens quoddam desiderium, ea propriis
& apertis oculis videndi loca, in quibus Servator Christus redemptionis nostrae mysteria omnia consummavit, quorum prius sola nomina ex scripturarum lectione noverat: unde & sacram Hierosolymorum urbem, miraculorum, praedicationis, ac passionis ejus testem invisit, atque domum rediens factus est Abbas. Claruisse fertur anno nati Servatoris, 1020. sub Canuto Dano.

ANdrew Leucander otherwise called Whiteman (as Leland reporteth) was by profession a Monke, and the third Abbat of the Abbey of Ramsie : he was exceedingly given to the studie of good artes, taking paines therein day & night, and profited greatly thereby. And amongst all other things, he had an incredible desire to see those places with his eyes, wherein Christ our Saviour performed and wrought all the mysteries of our redemption, the names of which places he onely knew before by the reading of the Scriptures. Whereupon he began his journey, and went to Jeru-282
salem a witnesse of the miracles, preaching, and passion of Christ, and being againe returned into his countrey, he was made the aforesayd Abbat. He flourished in the yere of Christ 1020. under Canutus the Dane.
