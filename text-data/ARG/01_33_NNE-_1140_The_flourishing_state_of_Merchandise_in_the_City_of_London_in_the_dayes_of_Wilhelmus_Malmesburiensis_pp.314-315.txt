The flourishing state of Marchandise in the Citie of London in the dayes of Willielmus Mal-mesburiensis, which died in the yeere 1142. in the reigne of K. Stephen.
Aud longe a Rofa quasi viginti quinque milliariis est Londonia Civitas nobilis, opima civium divitiis, constipata negociatorum ex omni terra,
& maxime ex Germania venientium, commerciis. Unde
fit ut cum ubique in Anglia caritas victualium pro sterili proventu messium sit, ibi necessaria distrahantur & emantur minore, quam alibi, vel vendentium compendio, vel ementium dispendio. Peregrinas invehit merces Civitatis finibus Tamesis fluvius famosus, qui citra urbem ad 80. milliaria fonticulo fusus, ultra plus 70. nomen profert.

Ot farre from Rochester, about the distance of five and twenty miles, standeth the Noble Citie of London, abounding with the riches of the inhabitants, and being frequented with the traffique of Marchants resorting thither out of all nations, and especially out of Germanie. Whereupon it commeth to passe, that Germanie. when any generail dearth of victuals falleth out in England, by reason of the scarcitie of corne, things necessary may there be provided and bought with lesse gaine unto the sellers, and with lesse hinderance and losse unto the buyers, then in any other place of the Realme. Outlandish wares are conveighed into the same Citie by the famous river of Thames: which river springing out of a fountaine 80. miles beyond the Citie, is called by one and the selfe same name. 70. miles beneath it.
