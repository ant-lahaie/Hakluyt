The travailes of one Richard surnamed 
Canonicus.
Ichardus Canonicus ad Trinitatis fanum Londini Regularis, ab ipsa pueritia, bonarum artium literas impense amavit, excoluit, ac didicit. Qui ex continuo labore atque exercitatione longa, talis tandem evasit orator, & Poeta, quales ea aetas rarissimos nutriebat. Ob id Rich-
ardo Anglorum tunc Regi charus, longam cum eo peregrinationem in Palaestinam ac Syriam, dum expugnaret Tureas, suscepit. Unde in Angliam tum demum reversus, omnia quae presens vidit in urbibus, agris, ac militum castris, fideli narratione, tam carmine quam prosa descripsit. Neque interim omisit ejusdem Regis mores, & formam, per omnia corporis lineamenta designare, addiditque praeclaro suo operi hoc aptissimum pro titulo nomen, scilicet, Itinerarium Regis Richardi. Claruit anno redemptionis nostrae 1200. sub Joanne Anglorum Rege.

From whence being returned againe into England, hee faithfully described both in Verse and Prose all such things as hee had seene in the Cities, fieldes and tentes of the souldiours, where hee was present, and omitted not to note the behaviour, forme, and proportion of body in the foresayd king, giving to his notable worke this most apt name for the title, The Journall of King Richard.
