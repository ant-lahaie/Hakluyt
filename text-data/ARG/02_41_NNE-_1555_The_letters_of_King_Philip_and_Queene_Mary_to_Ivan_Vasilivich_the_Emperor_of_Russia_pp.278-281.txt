Whereas by the consent and licence of our most deare and entirely beloved late brother, King Edward the sixt, whose soule God pardon, sundrie of our subjects marchants of the citie of London within this our realme of England did at their owne proper costs and adventure furnish three shippes to discover, serch, and find lands, Islands, regions, and territories before this adventure not knowen, ne commonly haunted and frequented by seas. The one of the which three shippes, named the Edward Bonaventure, (whereof our right welbeloved Richard Chancelour was then governour and great Captaine) chanced by the grace of God, and the good conduct of the sayd Chancelour to arrive and winter in the North part of your Empire of Russia. Forasmuch as we be credibly informed by the report of our trustie and welbeloved subject, that your Majestie did not onely call him and certaine of his company to your emperiall presence and speech, enter-tayned and banqueted them with all humanitie and gentlenes : but also being thereunto requested partly by the letters of our said brother, & partly by request of the sayd Richard Chancelour, have by your letters patents under your seale among other things granted : That all such marchants as shall come forth of anie of our realms of England or Ireland with al maner of wares, if they wil travel or occupie within your dominions, The same marchants with their marchandises in al your lordship may freely, & at their libertie travaile out and in without hinderance or any maner of losse : And of your farther ample goodnesse have promised that our ambassadours, if

Like as wee cannot but much commend your princely favour and goodnesse, and in like manner thanke you for the aboundant grace, extended to the sayd Richard Chancelour, and others our subjects marchants: Even so these are to pray and request you to continue the same benevolence toward them, and other our marchants and subjects, which doe or heereafter shall resorte to your countrey : And for the more assurance and incouragement to trade and exercise the feate of marchandise with your subjects and all other marchants within your dominions, that it may please you at this our contemplation to assigne and authorise such Commissaries as you shall thinke meete to trade and conferre with our welbeloved subjects and marchants, the sayd Richard Chancelour, George Killingworth, & Richard Graie, bearers of these our letters : who are by us authorised  for that purpose : and to confirme and graunt such other liberties and priviledges unto the Governour, Consuls, Assistants, and Communaltie of the fellowship of the saide Marchants, as the said bearers in their name propone and require by you to be granted for their safe conduct, good government, and order to bee erected and continued among them in your saide dominions ; And this with such your clemencie and expedition, as wee, upon the next arrivall of the saide Richard Chancelour may bee enformed of your gracious disposition and answere.
