FRier Hugo of Loubeux Verdala, by the grace of God, master of the holy house, the hospital of S.
John at Jerusalem, and an humble keeper of the poore of Jesus Christ, to all 8c every prince ecclesiastical 8c secular, 217
archbishops, bishops, Dukes, Marqueses, Barons, Capteines, Vicelords, Maiors, Castellanes, Admirals, and whatsoever patrons of Gallies, or other greater shippes, and governors of cities, potentates and magistrates, and other officers and persons whatsoever, of what dignitie, degree, state and condition soever they be, dwelling in all places and landes, greeting.
We make it knowne, and in the word of truth do witnesse, that in the moneth of May last past, our gallies came on the voyage from Barbarie, where having commandement to succour a little ship of the Christians which was driven over into that part, being arrived upon this Hand on the West part they found one English ship under the charge of the worshipfull John Keele, and David Fillie master : and our men willing to know what ship it was, they seemed to put themselves in order for their defence, doubting that the said our gallies were of the enemies, & therefore one mariner attempted contrary to the will of the worshipfull John Keele, and David Fillie maister, and had shot off a piece of artillerie against one of the said gallies, and because she would not strike amaine her sayle, according to the will of the saide worshipfull John Keele, and David Fillie master, the said ship was brought backe again unto the present port of Malta, according to the order of the reverend general of the said gallies : and in being there, maister Inquisitor staid it by authoritie of the holy office, and in that behalfe by the holi nesse of our Lord pope Gregorie the thirteenth, in the end was licenced to depart on her voyage. They therefore the said worshipfull John Keele and David Fillie, in the name and behalfe of the worshipfull master Edward Osborne Aiderman, and Richard Staper, English marchants of the noble citie of London, have humbly besought together with Thomas Wilkinson the purser, pilots, master and mariners, that we would give our letters patents, and safe conducts, that they might goe and returne, when they shall see opportunitie, with their goods and merchandizes at their pleasure : whereupon the
218
A PASSPORT TO ENGLISHMEN thing seeming unto us just, and that it might be for the profite of our religion, and of these strangers, by the tenor of these presents we have granted the same to them : yet, with the conditions hereunder written, viz.
That every time the said marchants of the said ship, or with any other, shall not bring such marchandize as is forbidden, and that by sufficient proofe and letters testimoniali it appeareth that they are free from the infections of the plague, they may victuali themselves with all necessarie victuals, and traffike with us, and in this Hand and dominion, and afterwarde may depart and follow their voyage whither they will into the Levant or else where, as all other vessels, and especially of France and other nations do, and sell and buy whatsoever marchandize they shal thinke good.
Item, that they may bring powder for cannon and harquebush, saltpeeter, cole of Newcastle, plates of lattin, tinne, Steele, yron, common karsies white, course canvas to make saile for the gallies, balles of yron for shot, fine milstones, trees & masts for gallies, litle and others, and in conclusion, having seene that they for the time of their abode here, did behave themselves like faithfull and catholike Christians, & that his holines hath allowed the safeconduct of the great Turke to them granted for feare of the Turkish armie, and other vessels of the enemie, submitting our selves to the pleasures of his holinesse, and especially because our people have occasion to passe by divers places so farre off, as England, Flanders, and all parts Westwards, and in other places, we have vouchsafed to make these our letters patents, as our faithfull assistant, so as more surely, and without let they may go and returne when they shall thinke good, with the said ship or with others at their pleasure. We therefore pray all and every of your subjects effectually that by what part soever of your jurisdiction, unto the which the said worshipfull John Keele and David Fillie by name abovesaid, with the ship and mariners of the said principali place or other, shall have accesse, saile, & 219
passe, and come safely with libertie without any disturbance or other impediment, that you give leave, and cause leave to be given that they may passe, stay and returne, and when they please, depart, in such sort, that for our love & contentation the said worshipfull John Keele, with the ship and mariners have no let, hinderance, or retention, also that you give all helpe and favour, a thing worthy of your justice, and to us most acceptable, to be recompenced with equall and greater service, when upon occasion it shalbe required.
And finally, we command all, and whatsoever religious people, and brothers of our religion, of whatsoever condition, degree, and state they be, and all other receivers and procurators, in all and whatsoever our priories deputed, and to be deputed by vertue of the holy obedience, and all our people, and all that are subject to the jurisdiction of our religion, that in, and by the same they hold, and repute the said worshipfull John Keele in the name as abovesaid, the ship, mariners, and marchandize, without let in the same their voyage, or in any other place, that they be not molested, nor in any wise hindered, but that in all their causes and businesse they be of you holpen, and furthered continually. In witnesse whereof, our seale of government is impressed to these presents in blacke waxe. Given at Malta in our Convent, the twelfth of the moneth of July, in the yeere 1582.
