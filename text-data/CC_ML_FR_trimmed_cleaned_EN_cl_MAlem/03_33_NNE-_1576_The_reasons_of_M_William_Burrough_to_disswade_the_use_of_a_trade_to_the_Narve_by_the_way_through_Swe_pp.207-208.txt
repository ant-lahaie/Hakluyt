certain reason to dissuade the use of a trade to the narve aforesaid , by way through Sweden . 
 the merchandise of the narve be gross ware , viz. flax , hemp , wax , tallow and hide . 
 the traffic at that place stand upon the agreement and like of the emperor of Russia , with the king of Sweden : for all these merchandise that be bring thither come from Plescove , Novogrod , and other part of the emperor dominion . 
 for transport those merchandise from narve to Stockholm , or what other place shall be think convenient in Sweden , it must be in vessel of those country , which will of small force to resist freebooter , or any other that shall make quarrel or offer violence against they . 
 when the good be bring into Sweden , they must be discharge , and new lade into small vessel , to carry the same by river or lake a part of the way , and again to be unlade and transport by land to newle . 
 so as the ordinary charge for transport of good from narve to newle by way as aforesaid , beside the spoil by so often lade and unlade , carriage by land , and the danger of the sea , pirate , etc will be such as when it shall|be so bring to newle it will be as dear to the merchant in that place as it shall be worth to be sell in London , wherefore the trade that way can be profitable to our nation . 
 moreover , when the good shall be in newle , it may note . be think doubtful to bring it thence quiet without dislike or forcible resistance of the king of Denmark , forasmuch as he make quarrel , and allege damage unto he in his toil of the sound by our trade to saint Nicholas , how much more will he now do by this way , and with how much great advantage may he

 perform it ? the danger that may grow in our trade to Russia by way of saint Nicholas , through the displeasure that the emperor may conceive by our trade with the Sweden to narve be also to be consider .
