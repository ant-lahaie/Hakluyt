the Russia company’s instruction a.d. 
 1561. 
 a remembrance give by we the governor , consul , and assistant of the company of merchant trade into Russia , the eight day of May 1561 , to our trusty friend Anthony Jenkinson , at his departure towards Russia , and so to Persia , in this our eight journey . 
 irst you shall understand that we have lade in our good ship , call the swallow , one chest , the key whereof we do here deliver you , and also a bill , wherein be write particular the content in the say chest , and what every thing do cost : and because , as 
 you know , the say chest be of charge , we desire you to have a speciali regard unto it , and when God shall send you unto Moscow , our mind and will be , that you , with the advice of our agent there , do appoint some such present for the emperor and his son , either wine , cloth of gold , scarlet , or plate , as to your good discretion shall be think meet , and when you have deliver unto he the queen majesty letter , and our say present in the name of the company , we think it good that you make your humble suit unto his highness in our name , to get his licence or safe conduct for you and all other our servant or agent at all time hereafter with such ware and merchandise as you at this time , or they hereafter at all other time shall think good to pass out of his dominion towards Tartary , Persia , or other place , and also to return unto Moscow with such ware and merchandise as you shall bring or send from any land or country that be not in his dominion , and if it be think good by you and our agent there to make composition with the emperor or his officer for some certain custom or toll upon such good as we shall 
 pass that way , to the intent we may be the better favour , we refer it to your discretion , foresee that you open of this matter be not prejudicial ! unto our former privilege . 
 and for the sale of our cloth of gold , plate , pearl , sapphire , and other jewel , we put our trust and confidence in you principal to sell they for ready money , time to good debtor , or in barter for good ware , so that you make our other agent privy how and for what price you sell any of the premise , and also deliver such sum of money , bill or ware , as you shall receive , unto our say agent : think good further , that if you perceive that the plate or other jewel , or any part thereof will not be sell for profit before your departure from the Moscow , that than you cause they to be safe pack , and set order they may be send hither again in our ship the next year , except you perceive that there may be some profit in carry some part of they into Persia , which we will not to be of any great value . 
 we have also lade in the say swallow and the other two ship 80 farthel , contain 400 kersy , as by you invoice do appear , which farthel be pack , and appoint to be carry into Persia : nevertheless , if you chance to find good sale for they in the Moscow , we think it be good to sell part of they there , and to carry the less quantity with you , because we be uncertain what vent or sale you shall find in Persia or other place where you shall come . 
 if you obtain the emperor licence to pass out of his dominion , and to return , as aforesaid , 8c that you perceive you may safe do the same , our mind be , that at such time as you think best and most convenient for that purpose , you do appoint so many , and such of our hire servant or apprentice as you think necessary and meet for our affair , and may best be spare , to go with you in your say voyage , whereof we will one to be such as you may make privy of 
 all your do for diverse consideration and cause that may happen : which servant and apprentice , we will and command , by this our remembrance , to be obedient unto you as unto we , not only to go with you and to doe such thing as you command they in your presence , but also to go unto such country or place as you shall appoint they unto , either with ware or without ware , and there to remain and continue so long as you shall think good , and if they or any of they will refuse to do such thing as you do appoint they , as aforesaid , or that any of they ( be he hire servant or apprentice ) do misuse himself by any manner of disobedience or disorder , and will not by gentle and fair mean be reform , we will that you send he back to the Moscow , with straight order that he may be send from thence hither , and let we have knowledge of his evil behaviour , to the intent that if he be a hire servant we may pay he his wage accord to his service , and if he be a apprentice we may use he accord to his desert . 
 we will also that you take with you such karsy , scarlet , and other clothes , or any other such ware of we , as you shall think good , and so in the name of God to take your journey towards Persia , either by the way of astracan and mare Caspium , or otherwise , as you shall see cause : and when God send you into Persia , our mind be , that you repair unto the great sophy with the queen majesty letter , if he be not too far from the caspian sea for you to travel , and that you make he such a present as you shall think meet , and if you pass by any other king , prince , or governor , before or after you come to the presence of the sophy , likewise to make they some present , as you see cause , accord to their estate and dignity , and withal to procure letter of privilege or safeconduct of the say sophy or other prince in as large and ample manner as you can , for the sure establish of further trade in merchandise by we hereafter to be 
 make , frequent and continue in those part , not only that we may free sell in all place within his dominion such ware as we carry thither , but also buy and bring away any manner of ware or merchandise whatsoever it be , that be for our purpose and commodity within his dominion , with free passage also for we at all time , to pass as often as we will with our good and merchandise into any part of India or other country thereunto adjoin , and in like manner to return through his dominion into Russia or elsewhere . 
 and for the sale of our kersy or other ware that you shall have with you , as our trust be that you will do for our most profit and commodity : even so we refer all unto your good discretion , aswell in the sale of our say good , as to make our return in such thing as you shall find there , and think best for our profit . but if passage can be have into Persia by astracan , or otherwise , the next summer , which shall|be in the year 1562 , than our mind be , that you procure to sell our kersy , and other such ware as be appoint for Persia , in the Moscow , or other the emperor dominion , if you may sell they for any reasonable price , and then to employ your self with such other of your servant , as you shall think the passage of meet for the search of the passage by Nova Zembla , or NovaZembla . e ] s you to return for England as you think good . provide always , that if you do perceive or understand , that passage be like to be have into Persia the summer follow , which shall|be in the year 1563 , and that you can not sell our kersy in the emperor dominion , as aforesaid , at a reasonable price : than we will rather they may be keep till the say summer in the year 1563 » and than you to proceed forward upon your journey towards Persia as aforesaid . if passage into Persia can be obtain the next year , neither good hope of passage in the year 1563 , neither yet in the mean time good sale of our kersy in the emperor dominion , than we think good for you to 
 see if you can practise to carry your say ware by safe conduct through Polonia , or any other way unto Constantinople , or else where you think better sale may be have , then in Russia . 
 thus have we give you to understand our meaning in this intend adventure : but forasmuch as we do consider and know , that if we shall prescribe unto you any certain way , or direct order what you shall do , we may so work clean contrary to our purpose and intent : therefore know your approve wisdom with your experience , and also your careful and diligent mind in the achieve and bring to good success ( by the help of almighty God ) all thing that you take in hand , we do commit our whole affair concern the say adventure whole unto your good discretion , pray God so to prosper you , as may be first for his glory , second for the honour and commodity of this realm , and next for our profit , with the increase of your good name for ever . 
 and yet further desire , and also most earnest require you , as you tender the state of our company , that you will have a speciali regard unto the order of our house and our servant , aswell at colmogro and Vologda , as at Moscow , and to see and consider if any misorder be among our servant or apprentice , whereby you think we may hereafter be put to hindrance or loss of any part of our good or privilege there , that you do not only see the same reform , but also to certify we thereof by your letter at large , as our trust be in you . 
 and for the better knowledge to be have in the price and goodness of such thing as we do partly suppose you shall find in the part of Russia , we do herewith deliver you a quantity of certain drug , whereby you may perceive how to know the best , and also there be note the price of such ware and drug as be here most vendible : also we deliver you herewith one pound and one ounce weight in

 brass , to the end , that you may thereby , and with the bill of price of ware , know what thing be worth here . as for the knowledge of silk , we need not to give you any instruction thereof , other then you know . 
 and if you understand that any commodity in Russia be profitable for we to have with you into Persia or other place , our mind be that our agent shall either provide it for you , or deliver you money to make provision your self . and because the russes say that in travel eastwardes from Colmogro thirty or forty day journey , there be the main sea to be find , we think that Richard Johnson may employ his time that way by land , and to be at Moscow time enough to go with you into Persia : for if it be true that he may travel to the sea that way , and that he may know how many mile it be towards the east from Colmogro , it will be a great help for we to find out the straight and passage that way , if any be there to be have .
