there to attend the force of the Portugal horse and foot , whereof the king have make promise , and to march some convenient number to Cascais to fetch our artillery and munition , which be all at our ship , save that which for the necessity of the service be bring along with we : whereunto , some carry away with the vain hope of don Antonio , that most part of the town stand for we , hold it best to make our abode there , and to send some 3000 for our artillery : promise to themselves , that the enemy be well beat the day before , will make no more sally : some other ( who unbelief be very strong of any hope from the Portugal ) persuade rather to march whole away , than to be any long carry away with the opinion of thing , whereof there be so little appearance . the general not willing to leave any occasion of blot to be lay upon he for his speedy go from thence , nor to lose any more time by attend the hope of don Antonio ; tell they , that though the expedition of Portugal be not the only purpose of their journey , but a adventure therein ( which if it succeed prosperous , may make they sufficient rich , and woonderfoll honourable ) and that they have do so much already in trial thereof , as what end soever happen , can nothing impair their credit : yet in regard of the king last promise , that he shall have that night 3000 man arm of his own country , he will not for that night dislodge . and if they come , thereby to make he so strong , that he may send the like number for his munition , he will resolve to try his fortune for the town . but if they come not , he find it not convenient to divide his force , by send any to Cascais , and keep a remainder behind , since he see they the day before so bold sally upon his whole army , and know that they be strong of soldier arm within the town , than he be without : and that before our return can be from Cascais , they expect more 5 Â° 3 supply from all place , of soldier : for the duke of Bragan ? a , and don Francisco de Toledo be look for with great relief . vz ^ hereupon his conclusion be , that if the 3000 promise come not that night , to march whole away the next morning . it may be here demand , why a matter of so great moment shall be so slender regard , as that the general shall march with such a army against such a enemy , before he know either the fullness of his own strength , or certain mean how he shall abide the place when he shall come to it . wherein i pray you remember the decree make in the council at Peniche , and confirm by public protestation the first day of our march , that our navy shall meet we in the river of Lisbon , in the which be the store of all our provision , and so the mean of our tarriance in that place , which come not , though we continue till we have no munition leave to entertain a very small fight . we be also to consider , that the king of Portugal ( whether carry away with imagination by the advertisement he receive from the Portugal , or will by any promise to bring such a army into his country , thereby to put his fortune once more in trial ) assure the general , that upon his first land , there will be a revolt of his subject : whereof there be some hope give at our first entry to Peniche , by the manner of die yield of that town and fort , which make the general think it most convenient speedy to march to the principali place , thereby to give courage to the rest of the country . the friar also and the poor people that come unto he promise , that within two day the gentleman and other of the country will come plentiful in : within which two [ ii two . 147 . ] day come many more priest , and some very few gentleman on horseback ; but not till we come to Torres Vedras : where they that note the course of thing how they pass , may somewhat discover the weakness of that people . there they take two day 504 more ; and at the end thereof refer he till our come to Lisbon , with assurance , that so soon as our army shall be see there , all the inhabitant will be for the king and fall upon the Spaniard . after two night tarriance at Lisbon , the king , as you have hear , promise a supply of 3000 foot , and some horse : but all his appointment be expire , even to the last of a night , all his horse can not make a cornet of 40 , nor his foot furnish two ensign full , although they carry three or four colour : and these be altogether such as think to enrich themselves by the ruin of their neighbour : for they commit more disorder in every place where we come by spoil , than any of our own . the general , as you see , have do more than before his come out of England be require by the king , and give credit to his many promise , even to the breach of the last , he desist not to persuade he to stay yet nine day long : in which time he may have engage himself further , than with any honour he can come out of again , by attempt a town fortify , wherein be more man arm against we , than we have to oppugn they withal , our artillery and munition be fifteen mile from we , and our man then decline ; for there be the first show of any great sickness among they . whereby it seem , that either his prelacy do much abuse he in persuade he to hope , whereof after two or three day he see no
