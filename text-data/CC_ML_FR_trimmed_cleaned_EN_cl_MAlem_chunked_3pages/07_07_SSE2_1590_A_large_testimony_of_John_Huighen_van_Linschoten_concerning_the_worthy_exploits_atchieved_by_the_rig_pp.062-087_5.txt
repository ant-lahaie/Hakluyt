danger they may fall into by the Englishman , which be no small charge , and hindrance to the fleet , for that the ship that lie there do consume themselves , and in a manner eat up one another , by reason of the great number of people , together with the scarcity of all thing , 76 so that many ship choose rather one by one to adventure [ ii two . 184 . . ] themselves alone to get home , than to stay there : all which fall into the Englishman hand , whereof diverse of great havoc the man be bring into Tercera , for that a whole ° f ^ pantariis - day we can see nothing else , but spoil man set on shore , some out of one ship , some out of another , that pity it be to see all of they curse the Englishman and their own fortune , with those that have be the cause to provoke the Englishman to fight , and complain of the small remedy and order take therein by the king of Spain officer . the 19 of the same month there come to Tercera a caravel of Lisbon , with one of the king officer , to cause the good that be save out of the ship which come from Malacca ( for you which we stay there ) to be lade and send to Lisbon . and at the same time there put out of the groin one don Alonso de Ba ^ an , with 40 great ship of war to come unto the hand , there to watch for the fleet of the spanish and Portugal Indies , and the good of the Malacca ship be lade , they be to convoy they all together into the river of Lisbon : but be certain day at sea , always have a contrary wind , they can not get unto the hand , only two of they that be scatter from the fleet , arrive at Tercera , and not find the fleet , they present return to seek they : in the mean time the king change his mind , and cause the fleet to stay in India , as i say before : and therefore he send word unto don Alonso de Bassan , that he shall return again to the groin , which he present do ( without do any thing , nor once approach near the hand , save only the two foresay ship , for he well know that the Englishman lie by the hand of Corvo , but he will not visit they : and so he return to the haven the groin , whereby our good that come from Malacca be yet to ship , and truss up again , and force to stay a more fortunate time with patience perforce . the 23 of October there arrive in Tercera a caravel with advise out of Portugal , that of 5 ship which in the year 1590 be lade in Lisbon for the Indies , 4 of they be turn again to Portin . after they have be 4 month abroad , and that the admiral , wherein the viceroy call Mathias d ’ albukerk sail , have only get to India , as afterward news thereof be bring overland , have be at the least 11 month at sea and never see land , and come in great misery to Malacca . in this ship there die by the way 280 man , accord to a note by himself make , and send to the cardinal at Lisbon , with the name and surname of every man , together with a description of his voyage , and the misery they have endure , which be only do , because he will not lose the government of India : and for that cause he have swear either to lose his life , or to arrive in India , as in deed he do afterward , but to the great danger , loss and hindrance of his company , that be force to buy it with their life , and only for want of provision , as it may well be think : for he know full well that if he have return back again into Portugal as the other ship do , he shall have be cassier from his indian regiment , because the people begin already to murmur at he for his proud and lofty mind . and among other thing that show his pride the more , behind above the gallery of his ship he cause fortune to be paint , and his own picture w ‘ a staff stand by she , as it be threaten fortune , with this posy , Quero que vencas , that be , i will have thou to overcome : which be read by the cardinal and other gentleman ( that to honour he bring he aboard his ship ) it be think to be a point of exceed folly : but it be no strange matter among the Portugal : for they above all other must of force let the fool peep out of their sleeve , special when they be in authority , for that i know the say Mathias d ’ albukerk in India , be a soldier and a captain , where he be esteem and account for one of the best of they , and much honour , and belove of all man , as behave himself courteous to every man , linschoten ’ s large testimony a . d . 1589 - 91 . whereby they all desire that he may be viceroy . but when he once have receive his patent with full power and authority from the king to be viceroy , he change so much from his former behaviour , that by reason of his pride , they all begin to fear and curse he , and that before he depart out of Lisbon , as it be often see in many man that be advance unto state and dignity . the 20 of Januarie 1591 . there be news bring out of Portugal into Tercera , that the Englishman have take a ship that the king have send into the portugal -
