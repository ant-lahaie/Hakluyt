gold , or rich stone . and to say the truth , all the branch and small river which fall into Orenoque be raise with such speed , as if we wade they over the shoe in the morning outward , we be cover to the shoulder homeward the very same day : and to stay to dig out gold with our nail , have be opus laboris but not Ingenii : such a quantity as will have serve our turn we can not have have , but a discovery of the mine to our infinite disadvantage we have make , and that can have be the best profit of far search or stay : for those mine be not easy break , nor open in haste , and i can have return a good quantity of gold ready cast , if i have not shoot at another mark , then present profit . this arwacan pilot with the rest , fear that we will have eat they , or otherwise have put they to some the Spaniard cruel death ( for the Spaniard , to the end that none of the dtvehsh hes . peop [ e jn the passage towards Guiana or in Guiana it self may come to speech with we , persuade all the nation , that we be men - eater , and cannibal ) but when the poor man and woman have see we , and that we give they meat , and to every one something or other , which be rare and strange to they , they begin to conceive the deceit and purpose of the Spaniard , who indeed ( as 39 Â° they confess ) take from they both their wife and daughter daily , and use they for the satisfy of their own lust , especial such as they take in this manner by strength . but i protest before the majesty of the live God , that i neither know nor believe , that any of our company one or other , by violence or otherwise , ever know any of their woman , and yet we see many hundred , and have many in our power , and of those very young , and excellent favour , which come among we without deceit , stark naked . nothing get we more love among they then this usage : for i suffer not any man to take from any of the nation so much as a Pina , or a potato root , without give they contentment , nor any man so much as to offer to touch any of their wife or daughter : which course so contrary to the Spaniard ( who tyrannize over they in all thing ) draw they to admire her majesty , who commandment i tell they it be , and also wonderful to honour our nation . but i confess it be a very impatient work to keep the mean sort from spoil and steal , when we come to their house : which because in all i can not prevent , i cause my indian interpreter at every place when we depart , to know of the loss or wrong do , and if aught be steal or take by violence , either the same be restore , and the party punish in their sight , or else be pay for to their uttermost demand . they also much wonder at we , after they hear that we have slay the Spaniard at Trinidad , for they be before resolve , that no nation of Christians dare abide their presence , and they wonder moor when i have make they know of the great overthrow that her majesty army and fleet have give they of late year in their own country . after we have take in this supply of bread , with diverse basket of root which be excellent meat , i give one of the canoas to the Arwacas , which belong to the Spaniard that be escape , and when i have dismiss all 391 A . D . 1595 - a notable course of justice . but the captain ( who by the Spaniard be christen Martin ) i send back in the same Canoa the old ciawan , and Ferdinando my first pilot , and give they both such thing as they desire , with sufficient victuali to carry they back , and by they write a letter to the ship , which they promise to deliver , and perform it , and then i go on , with my new hire pilot Martin the arwacan : but they come on the next or second day after , we come aground again ground with w ^ h our galley , and be like to cast she away , with all etr ga y . our victuali and provision , and so lie on the sand one whole night and be far more in despair at this time to free she then before , because we have no tide of flood to help we , and therefore fear that all our hope will have end in mishap : but we fasten a anchor upon the land , and with main strength draw she off : and so the fifteen day we discover afar off the mountain of Guiana to our great joy , and towards the evening have a slent of a northerly wind that blow very strong , which bring we in sight of the great river Orenoque ; out of which this river descend wherein we be : we descry afar off three other canoas as far as we can discern they , after who we hasten with our barge and wherry , but two of they pass out of sight , and the third enter up the great river , on the right hand to the westward , and there stay out of sight , think that we mean to take the way eastward towards the province of Carapana , for that way the Spaniard keep , not dare to go upward to Guiana , the people in those part be all their enemy , and those in the canoas think we to have be those Spaniards that be flee from Trinidad , and have escape kill : and when we come so far down as the open of that branch into which they slip , be near they with our barge and wherry , we make after they , and ere they can land , come within call , and by our interpreter
