upon we , shoot off their arrow as thick as hail , unto who mercy we be â€™ constrain to yield , not have among we any kind of armour , nor yet weapon , save one caliver , and two old rusty sword , whereby to make any resistance , or to save our self : which when they perceive , that we seek not any other than favour and mercy at their hand , and that we be not their enemy the Spaniard , they have compassion on we , and come and cause we all to sit down : and when they have a while survey , and take a perfect view of we , they come to all such as have any colour clothes among we , and those they do strip stark naked , and take their clothes away with they , but those that be apparel in black they do not meddle withal , and so go their way , and leave we without do we any further hurt , only in the first brunt they kill eight of our man . eight of our And at our departure , they perceive in what weak slalne . case we be , point we with their hand which way we shall go to come to a town of the Spaniard , which as we afterward perceive , be not pass ten league from thence , use these word : tampice , tampice , Christiano , tampice Christiano , which be as much ( we think ) as to say in english , at tampice you shall find the Christians . the weapon that they use be no other but bow and arrow , and their arm be so good , that they very seidome miss to hit 411 any thing that they shoot at . Shortly after they have leave we strip ( as aforesaid ) we think it best to divide our self into two company , and so be separ - Anthony at , half of we go under the lead of one Anthony Godard . Godard , who be yet a man alive , and dwell at this instant in the town of Plymouth , who before we choose to be captain over we all , and those which go under his lead , of which number i mile Philips be one , travail westward that way which the Indians with their hand have before point we to go . the other half go under the lead of one John Hooper , who they do choose for their captain , and with the David company that go with he , David Ingram be one , Ingram . an ( j gy take their way and travel northward , and short after , within the space of two day , they be again encounter with the savage people , and their captain Hooper and two more of his company be slay : then again they divide themselves , and some hold on their way still northward , and other some , know that we be go westward , seek to meet with we again , as in truth there be about the number of 25 or 26 of they that meet with we in the space of four day again , and then we begin to reckon among our self , how many we be that be set on shore , and we find the number to be a hundred and fourteen , whereof two be drown in the sea , and eight be slay at the first encounter , so that there remain a hundred and four , of which 25 went westward with we , and 52 to the north with Hooper and Ingram : and as Ingram since have often tell i , there be not pass three of their company slay , and there be but six and twenty of they that come again to we , so that of the company that go northward , there be yet lack , and not certain hear of , the number of three and twenty man . and very i do think that there be of they yet alive , and marry in the say country , at Cibola , as hereafter i purpose ( God will ) to discourse of more particular , with the reason 412 and cause that make i so to think of they that be lack , which be David Ingram , twide , brown , and sundry other , who name we can not remember . And be thus meet again together , we travel on still westward , sometime through such thick wood , that we be enforce with cudgel to break away the bramble and bush from tear our naked body : other sometime we shall travel through the plain , in such high grass that we can scarce see one another , and as we pass in some place , we shall have of our man slay , and fall down sudden , be strike by the Indians , which stand behind tree and bush , in secret place , and so kill our man as they go by , for we go scatter in seek of fruit to relieve our self . we be also oftentimes great annoy with a kind of fly , which in the indian tongue be call Tequani , and the Spaniard call they muskitos . there be also in the say country a number of other kind of fly , but none so noisome as these tequany be : you shall hardly see they they be so small , for they be scarce so big as a gnat ; they will suck one blood marvelous , and if you kill they while they be suck , they be so venomous that the place will swell extreme , even as one that be sting with a wasp or bee : but if you let they suck their fill , and to go away of themselves , than they do you no other hurt , but leave behind they a red spot somewhat big than a flea - bite . at the first we be terrible trouble with these kind of fly , not know their quality , and resistance we can make none against they , be naked : as for cold we fear not any , the country there be always so warm . and as we travel thus for the space of ten or
