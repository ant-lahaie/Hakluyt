, as be by they oppress , and have free all the coast of the northern world from their servitude , have send i to free they also , and withal to defend the country of Guiana from their invasion and conquest . i show they her majesty picture which they so admire and honour , as it have be easy to have bring they idolatrous thereof . the like and a more large discourse i make to the rest of the nation both in my pass to Guiana , and to those of the border , so as in that part of the world her majesty be very famous and admirable , who they now call Ezrabeta Cassipuna Aquerewana , which be as much as Elizabeth , the great princess or great commander . this do we leave Puerto de los espannole , and return to Curiapan , and have Berreo my prisoner i gather from he as much of Guiana as he know . this Berreo be a gentleman well descend , and have long serve the spanish king in Milan , Naples , the low country and elsewhere , very valiant and liberali , and a gentleman of great assuredness , and of a great heart : i use he accord to his estate and worth in all thing i can , accord to the small mean i have . i send captain Whiddon the year before to get what knowledge he can of Guiana , and the end of my journey at this time be to discover and enter the same , but my intelligence be far from truth , for the country be situate above 600 . English mile further from the sea , than i be make believe it have be , which afterward understand to be true by Berreo , i keep it from the knowledge of my company , who else will never have be bring to attempt the same : of which 600 . mile i pass 400 . leave my ship so far from i at anchor in the sea , which be more of desire to perform that discovery , then of reason , especial have 354 * 595 - such poor and weak vessel to transport our self in ; for in the bottom of a old Galego which i cause to be fashion like a galley , and in one barge , two whirry , and a shipboat of the lion whelp , we carry 100 person and their victual for a month in the same , be all drive to lie in the rain and weather , in the open air , in the burn sun , and upon the hard board , and to dress our meat , and to carry all manner of furniture in they , wherewith they be so pester and unsavoury , that what with victual be most fish , with wet clothes of so many man thrust together , and the heat of the sun , i will undertake there be never any prison in England , that can be find more unsavoury and loathsome , especial to my self , who have for many year before be diet and care for in a sort far more differ . if captain Preston have not be persuade that he shall have come too late to Trinidad to have find we there ( for the month be expire which i promise to tarry for he there ere he can recover the coast of Spain ) but that it have please God he may have join with we , and that we have enter the country but some ten day soon ere the river be overflow , we have adventure either to have go to the great city of Manoa , or at least take so many of the other city [ in . 634 . i and town near at hand , as will have make a royal return : but it please not God so much to favour i at this time : if it shall be my lot to prosecute the same , i shall willing spend my life therein , and if any else shall enable thereunto , and conquer the same , i assure he thus much , he shall perform more than ever be do in Mexico by Cortes , or in Peru by Pizarro , whereof the one conquer the empire of Mutezuma , the other of Guascar , and Atabalipa , and whatsoever prince shall possess it , that prince shall be lord of more gold , and of a more beautiful empire , and of more city and people , then either the king of Spain , or the great Turk . 3S5 but because there may arise many doubt , and how this empire of Guiana be become so populous , and adorn with so many great city , town , temple , and treasure , i think good to make it know , that the emperor now reign be descend from those magnificent prince of Peru , of who large territory , of who policy , conquest , edifice , and riches Pedro de Cieza , Francisco Lopez , and other have write large discourse : for when Francisco Pizarro , Diego Almagro and other conquer the say empire of Peru , and have put to death Atabalipa son to Guaynacapa , which Atabalipa have former cause his elder brother Guascar to be slay , one of the young son of Guaynacapa flee out of Peru , and take with he many thousand of those soldier of the empire call Orejones , and with those and many other which follow he , he vanquish all that tract and valley of America which be situate between the great river of Amazones , and Baraquan , otherwise call Orenoque and Marannon . the empire of Guiana be direct east from Peru towards the sea , and lie under the equinoctial line , and it have more abundance of gold then any part of Peru , and as many or more great city than ever Peru have when it flourish most : it be govern by the same law , and the emperor and people observe the same religion , and the same form and policy in government as be use in Peru , not differ in any part : and i have be the stateliness assure by such of the Spaniard as have see Manoa the of Manoa . Imperial city of Guiana , which the Spaniard call el Dorado , that for the greatness
