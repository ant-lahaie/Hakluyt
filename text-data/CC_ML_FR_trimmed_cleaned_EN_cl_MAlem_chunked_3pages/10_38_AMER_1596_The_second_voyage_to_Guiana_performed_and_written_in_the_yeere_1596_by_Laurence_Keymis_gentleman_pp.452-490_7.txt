whereof there be such scarcity , by reason that the Indians forsake their house , have not this half year plant any of their ground , so that the Spaniard be enforce to seek their bread far off , and content themselves to live with little . in sail up the river , we pass by Toparimacko the port of his port , which in one place be very shoalde , the channel Toparimacko . lie close aboard the shore . we return therefore another way by the main river on the south side : this branch we find large , deep , and without danger . when we be come near Carapana his the port of port , he send five or six several canoas , promise carofana - this day and the next , that he will come and speak with we . thus we linger six or seven day , but he come not . in the end he send one of his age follower , to certify we , that he be sick , old , and weak : that the way near his dwelling be not easy : and that therefore he desire we to hold he excuse for not come . this old man dilate unto we , that Carapana in hope of our return , have ever since your lordship be in that country , keep the mountain , where the Spaniard can hardly any way enforce he ; that they have take from he and his people many of their wife , because they refuse to furnish they weekly with a certain proportion of bread and victual : that don Juan otherwise call Eparacano have the commandment of all his subject , except only a choice guard of man sufficient to keep the place he now dwell in . that it repent he of his ambition , ever to have seek by the Spaniard mean , to have enlarge his country and 471 people . for true it be that from the beginning he be a lord of no other then ordinary power among they , until he have enter into friendship with Berreo : for than the indian on all side leave some their habitation , and many their commander to become his subject , that they may have the privilege to trade with the Spaniard for hatchet and knife , which be jewel of great price among they : that he now see no other choice , but that the Indians must , if they will do well , without far dissemble of their necessity , either entertain we their friend , or else give place to the Spaniard their enemy . for the plenty of gold that be in this country , be now know and discover , there be no possibility for they to keep it : on the one side they can feel no great misery , nor fear more extremity , than they be sure to find , if the Spaniard prevail , who perforce do take all thing from they , use they as their slave , to run , to row , to be their guide , to carry their burden , and that which be worst of all , to be content , for safety of their life , to leave their woman , if a Spaniard chance but to set his eye on any of they to fancy she : on the otherside they can hope for , nor desire no better state and usage , than her majesty gracious government , and princely virtue do promise , and assure unto they . for , say he , the other year , when we flee into the mountain , and measure your do by the Spaniard in like case , we make no other account » but that your commander be able , as he be , will doubtless have persecute we to the uttermost , as the only maintainer and supporter of your enemy , and will at the least , if he can not reach we , take our town , and make we ransom our wife and child : we find it far otherwise , and that none of your well govern company dare offer any of we wrong or violence , no not by stealth , when unknown they may have do it . we then believe it to be 472 true , that your grand captain report of his princess , take this for a good proof of her royal commandment and wisdom , that have frame her subject to such obedience , and of your happiness , that enjoy the benefit thereof : that Carapana weigh the good and Carapana a friendly course of our proceed , do humble crave p ™ * of her Maj estie for himself and his people , that with upon the rest of the Indians , which whole depend on she crave her princely regard towards they , he also may enjoy majesty she favourable protection : that he do this , not fntectiim - as a man leave unto himself and forsake by the Spaniard , but as one that know their injustice , hate their cruelty , and take it for his best choice , utter to disclaim their friendship . it may be pertinent ( as sure it be a thing worth the note ) to consider how this precedent of your moderation and good order , which to we seem a matter but of small and ordinary respect , have both alienate their heart altogether from the Spaniard , and stir up in they true love and admiration thereof . for as government be the only bond of common society : so to man lawless , that each one to another be , omnes hoc jure molesti , quo fort : to man , i say , that live in daily tumult , fear , doubt , suspicion , barbarous cruelty , never sleep secure , but always either drink , or practise one another death : to such man as these bee , who want discipline , justice and good order to confirm they in a quiet and peaceable course of live , know not where to find it : the sense and sweetness thereof be as the dew of Hermon : it be as the harmony of a well tune instrument : to be brief , it carry in it self not only a due and worthy commendation ; but be available without stroke strike to gain a kingdom . for the indian in
