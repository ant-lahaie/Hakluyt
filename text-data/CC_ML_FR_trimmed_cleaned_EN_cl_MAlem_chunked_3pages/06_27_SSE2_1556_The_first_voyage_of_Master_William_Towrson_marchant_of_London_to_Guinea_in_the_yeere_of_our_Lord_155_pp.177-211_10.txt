if any man will come unto we : and see that none do come , we man our boat and put in merchandise , and go and anchor with our boat near to the shore : than they send out a man to we who make we sign that that be the town of don John , and that he himself be in the country , and will be at home at the go down of the sun , and when he have do , he require a reward , as the most part of they will do which come first aboard , and i give he one ell of cloth and he depart , and that night we hear no more of he . the nine day in the morning we go again with our boat to the shore , and there come forth a boat to we , who make sign that don John be not come home , but will be at home this day : and to that place also come another boat from the other town a mile from this , which be call don Devis , and bring with he gold to show we , make sign that we shall come thither . i then leave in this place John Savill , and John Makeworth , and take the hind , and go to the other town and there anchor , and take cloth and go to shore with the boat , and by and by the boat come to we and bring a measure of four yard long and a half , and show we a weight of a angel and twelve grain , which they will give for so much , and not otherwise : so i stay and make no bargain . and [ ii two . 33 . ] all this day the bark lie at don Johns town , and do nothing , have answer that he be not come home . the ten day we go again to the shore , and there come out a boat with good store of gold , and have drive the matter off a long time , and have 202 bring the measure to a nail less than three else , and their weight to a angel and twenty grain , and can not bring they to more , i do conclude with they and sell , and within one quarter of a hour i take one pound and a quarter of a ounce of gold : and then they make i sign to tarry , till they have part their cloth upon the shore as their manner be , and they will come again , and so they go away , and lay the cloth all abroad upon the sand piece by piece , and by and by one come run down from the town to they , and speak unto they , and forthwith every man make as much haste as he can away , and go into the wood to hide his gold and his cloth : we mistrust some knavery , and be wave by they to come a shore , yet we will not , but go aboard the hind , and perceive upon the hill 30 man which we judge to be Portugal : and they go up to the top of the hill and there muster and show themselves , have a flag with they . than i be desirous to know what the hart do , take the hind boat and go towards she , and when i come near to they they shoot off two piece of ordinance which i marveil at : i make as much haste as i can to she , and meet her boat and skiff come from the shore in all haste , and we meet aboard together . they show i that they have be a shore all that day , and have give to the two son of don John , to either of they three yard and a half of cloth , and three bason betwixt they , and have deliver he 3 yard of cloth more and the weight of a angel and 12 grain , and be on land do tarry for his answer , and in the mean time the Portugal come running from the hill upon they , whereof the negro a little before have give they warning , and bid they to go away but they per - invade our ceive it not . the son of don John conspire with man . the Portugal against they , so that they be almost upon they , but yet they recover their boat and set off from the shore , and the Portugal shoot their 203 caliver at they , but hurt no man , and then the ship perceive it , shoot off the two piece aforesay among they . hereupon we lay base in both the boat , and in the skiff and man they well , and go a shore again , but because of the wind we can not land , but lie off in the sea about ten score and shot at they , but the hill succour they , and they from the rock and from the hill shoot at we with their half hake , and the negro more for fear then for love stand by they to help they , and when we see that the negro be in such subjection unto they that they dare not sell we any thing for fear of they we go aboard , and that night the wind keep at the east , so that we can not with our ship fetch the hind , but i take the boat in the night and go aboard the bark to see what be there to be do , and in the morning we perceive the town to be in like case lay with Portugal , so we weigh and go along the coast . this town of John de Viso stand upon a hill like the town of don John , but it have be burn , so that there be not pass six house in it : the most part of the gold that come thither come out of the country , and no doubt if the people dare for fear of the Portugal bring forth their gold , there will be have good store
