straggle all alone , from who they have take his head and heart , and have straggle the other bowel about the place , in a most brutish and beastly manner . in revenge whereof at our depart we consume with fire all the house , aswell in the country which we see , as in the town of saint Iago . from hence put off to the west Indies , we be not many day at sea , but there begin among our people such mortality , as in few day there be dead above two or three hundred man . and until some seven or eight day after our come from saint Iago , there have not die any one man of sickness in all the fleet : the sickness show not his infection wherewith so many be strike , until we be depart thence , and then seize our people with extreme hot burn and continual ague , whereof very few escape with life , and yet those for the most part not without great alteration and decay of their wit and strength for a long time after . in some that die be plain show the small spot , which be often find upon those that be infect with the plague : we be not above eighteen day in passage between the sight of saint Iago aforesaid , and the island of Dominica , be the 109 first island of the west Indies that we fall withal , the same be inhabit with savage people , which go all naked , their skin colour with some paint of a reddish tawny , very personable and handsome strong man , who do admit little conversation with the Spaniard : for as some of our people may understand they , they have a Spaniard or twain prisoner with they , neither do i think that there be any safety for any of our nation , or any other to be within the limit of their commandment , albeit they use we very kind for those few hour of time which we spend with they , help our folk to fill and carry on their bare shoulder fresh water from the river to our ship boat , and fetch from their house great store of tobacco , as also a kind of bread which they feed on , call Cassavi , very white and savoury , make of the root of Cassavi . in recompense whereof , we bestow liberali reward of glass , colour bead , and other thing , which we have find at saint Iago , wherewith ( as it seem ) they rest very great satisfy , and show some sorrowful countenance when they perceive that we will depart . from hence we go to another island westward of it , call saint Christopher island , wherein we spend some day of Christmas , to refresh our sick people , and to cleanse and air our ship . in which island be not any people at all that we can hear of . in which time by the general it be advise and resolve , with the consent of the lieutenant general , the vice - admiral , and all the rest of the captain to proceed to the great island of Hispaniola , aswell for that we know our self then to be in our best strength , as also the rather allure thereunto , by the glorious fame of the ci tie of saint Domingo , be the ancient and chief inhabit place in all the tract of country thereabouts . and so proceed in this determination , by the way we meet a small frigate , bind for the same place , the which the viceadmiral take : and have due examine the man that be in she , iio there be one find , by who we be advertise , the haven to be a barren haven , and the shore or land thereof to be well fortify , have a castle thereupon furnish with great store of artillery , without the danger whereof be no convenient land place within ten english mile of the city , to which the say pilot take upon he to conduct we . all thing be thus consider on , the whole force be command in the evening to embark themselves in pinnace , boat , and other small bark appoint for this service . our soldier be thus embark , the general put himself into the bark Francis as admiral , and all this night we lie on the sea , bear small sail until our arrival to the land place , which be about the break of the day , and so we land , be newyeeres day , nine or ten mile to the westwards of that brave city of saint Domingo : for at that time nor yet be know to we any land place , where the sea - surge do not threaten to overset a pinnace or boat . our general have see we all land in safety , return to his fleet , bequeathe we to God , and the good conduct of master Carliell our lieutenant general : at which time , be about eight of the clock , we begin to march , and about noon time , or towards one of the clock , we approach the town , where the gentleman and those of the better sort , be some hundred and fifty brave horse or rather more , begin to present themselves ; but our small shot play upon they , which be so sustain with good proportion of pike in all part , as they find no part of our troop unprepared to receive they ( for you must understand they view all round about ) they be thus drive to give we leave to proceed towards the two gate of the town , which be the next to the seaward . they have man they both , and plant their ordinance for that present , and sudden alarm without the gate , and also some troop of small shot in ambuscado upon the high way side . we divide our whole force , be some thousand or twelve hundred man into two part , to enterprise both the gate at one instant , the lieutenant general have open vow to captain Powel ( who lead the troop that enter the other gate ) that with god good favour he will not rest until our meeting in the market place . their ordinance have no soon discharge upon our near approach , and make some execution among we , though not much , but the lieutenant general begin forthwith to advance both his voice of encouragement , and pace of march : the first man that be
