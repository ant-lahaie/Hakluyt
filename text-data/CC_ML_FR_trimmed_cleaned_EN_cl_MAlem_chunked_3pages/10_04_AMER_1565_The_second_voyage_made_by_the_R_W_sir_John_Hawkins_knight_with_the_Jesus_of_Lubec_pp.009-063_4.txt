, but in form alike , adjoin unto the which there be a place make of four good stancion of wood , and a round roof over it , the ground also raise round with clay a foot high , upon the which floor be straw many fine mat : this be the consultation - house , the like whereof be in all town , as the Portugal affirm : in which place , when they sit in counsel the king or captain sit in the midst , and the elder upon the floor by he : ( for they give reverence to their elder ) and the common sort sit round about they . there the consultation house or towne - howse . they sit to examine matter of theft , which if a man be take with , to steal but a Portugal cloth from another , he be sell to the Portugal for a slave . they consult also , and take order what time they shall go to war : and as it be certain report by the Portugal , they take order in gather of the fruit in the season of the year , and also of Palmito wine , which be gather by a Palmito be a hole cut in the top of a tree , and a gourde set for the mlde datereceive thereof , which fall in by drop , and yield fresh wine again within a month , and this divide part and portion - like to every man , by the judgement of the captain and elder , every man hold himself content : and this sure i judge to be a very good order : for otherwise , whereas scarcity of Palmito be , every man will have the same , which may breed great strife : but of such thing , as every man do plant for himself , the sour thereof reap it to his own use , so that nothing be common , but that which be unset by man hand . in their house there be more common passage of lizards like evat , and other great , of black and blue colour , of near a foot long , beside their tail , than there be with we of Mise in great house . the sapy and sambose also use in their war bow , and arrow make of reed , with head of iron poison a venomous with the juice of a Cucumber , whereof i have many in Cucumber . my hand . in their battle they have target -
