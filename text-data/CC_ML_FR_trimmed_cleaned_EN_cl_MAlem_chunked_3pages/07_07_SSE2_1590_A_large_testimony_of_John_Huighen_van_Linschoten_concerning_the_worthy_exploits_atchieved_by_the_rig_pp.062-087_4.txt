Vincent there lay a fleet of 20 english ship to watch for the armada , so that if they have put into saint Lucar , they have fall right into their hand , which if the wind have serve they have do . and therefore they may say that the wind have lend they a happy voyage : for if the Englishman have meet with they , they have sure be in great danger , and possible but few of they have escape , by reason of the fear wherewith they be possess , because fortune or rather God be whole against they : which be a sufficient cause to make the Spaniard out of heart , and to the contrary to give the Englishman more courage , and to make they bold for that they be victorious , stout and valiant : and see all their enterprise do take so good effect , that thereby they be become lord and master of the sea , and need care for no man , as it well appear by this brief discourse . the 7 of August 1590 . a navy of english ship be see before Tercera , be 20 in number , and 5 of they the queen ship : their general be one Martin Frobisher , as we after have intelligence . they come purposely to watch for the fleet of the spanish Indies , and for the indian ship , and the ship of the country in the west : which put the hander in great fear , special those of Fayal , for that the Englishman send a trumpet to the governor to ask certain wine , flesh , and other victual for their money and good friendship . they of Fayal do not only refuse to give ear unto they , but with a shot kill their messenger or trumpeter : which the Englishman take in evil part , send they word that they be best to look to themselves and stand upon their guard , for they mean to come and visit they whether they will or no . the governor make they answer , that he be there in the behalf of his majesty of Spain , and that he will do his best to keep they out , as he be bind : but nothing be do , although they of Fayal be in no little fear , send to Tercera for aid , from whence they have certain bark with powder and munition for war , with some biscuit and other necessary provision . the 30 of August we receive very certain news out of Portugal , that there be 80 ship put out of the groin lade with victual , munition , money and soldier , to go for Britain to aid the catholic and leaguer of France against the king of Navarre . at the same time two Netherlands hulk come out of Portugal ! to Tercera be half the sea over , meet with 4 of the queen ship , their general be sir John Hawkins , that stay they , but let they go again without do they any harm . the netherlander report , that each of the queen ship have 80 piece of ordinance , and that captain Drake lie with 40 ship in the english channel watch for the army of the groin : and likewise that there lay at the cape S . Vincent ten other english ship , that if any ship escape from the hand , they may take they .
