do , and have command to give you a letter forthwith in their behalf , direct to his officer of Duina , to suffer the say merchant to sell their corn , by measure great or small at their pleasure

send after you with speed to Colmogro . and as touch the money which you require , it can be pay here because we have not the book of account , for want whereof we know not what to pay : wherefore the best be that you send one of the merchant after the emperor to Novogrod , and let he repair unto i there , and without fade i will pay all such money as shall be appoint by his majesty to be pay after the book see . but forasmuch as there be none of your servant with i at that present ( although i have earnest write unto your agent Nicholas proctor by Richard pingle one of your own servant , one month before my come to Starites , where i have my dispatch , that he shall not fade to come himself , or send one of your servant to i hither , to follow all such suit as i shall commence in your

the letter of privilege , but it will not be grant in any wise that i shall leave any of my own company behind i , and thereupon i do take my leave with full dispatch , and depart to my lodging , and forthwith there come unto i a gentleman who have charge as well to conduct i , and provide boat , man , post horse and victual for i all the way to the sea side , be a thousand and three hundred mile , as also to do justice of the say Bessone , as aforesaid . and he say unto i , the emperor pleasure be , that you shall present depart from hence , and i be appoint to go with you . and that night i

well expect a messenger to bring unto i the new letter of privilege , as the come of Rutter , who the emperor majesty himself command before my face shall be send unto i without fade , and i do see the letter write to the chief officer at the Moscow for the same . nevertheless the say rutter do not come , neither can i hear of he after , nor know the sudden cause of his stay contrary to the prince own word and meaning , as i suppose . but i can not help the matter be far from the prince , neither can i tell how to have redress , because by absence i can not complain . notwithstanding i use my endeavour , and send a messenger John Norton one of your servant from Vologda to Novogrod , where the court then lie , express with letter , as well to advertise his majesty that the say rutter be not send unto i accord to his highness commandment and order , as also about the dispatch of the say letter of privilege and receit of your money , with straight charge that he shall in any wise return unto i again before the depart of the ship . and the first day of June i depart from the say Vologda by water towards Colmogro , where i arrive the 21 of June aforesaid , and remain there until the 23 of July , look for the say John Norton to have return unto i in all that time , which have respite full enough in that space both to go to the court to dispatch his business , and to have return again unto i , but he come not , for it be otherwise determine before his go , as i do after understand , and can more at large by word of mouth declare unto your worship the occasion thereof . nevertheless , i be well assure before this time your agent have receive into his hand the say letter of privilege , and shall have dispatch with expedition in all thing touch your affair , accord to

again into his favour , so your agent and other your servant there resident may behave , and endeavour themselves to keep and augment the same , who evil do have be the only occasion of his indignation now remit .
