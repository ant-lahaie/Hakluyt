Jacomo Vatica , which be bind to Cyprus with his ship , with who i go : and when we be arrive in Cyprus , i leave that ship , and go in a lesser to Tripoli in Soria , where i stay a while . afterwards i take my journey to Aleppo , and there i acquaint my self with merchant of Armenia , and moor , that 366 be merchant , and consort to go with they to ormus , and we depart from Aleppo , and in two day journey and a half , we come to a city call Bir . of the city call Bir . by | our be a small city very scarce of all manner of victual , and near unto the wall of the city run the river of Euphrates . in this city the merchant divide themselves into company , accord to their merchandise that they have , and there either they buy or make a boat to carry they and their good to Babylon down the river Euphrates , with charge of a master and mariner to conduct the boat in the voyage : these boat be in Euphrates . a manner flat bottomed , yet they be very strong : and for all that they be so strong , they will serve but for one voyage . they be make accord to the sholdnesse of the river , because that the river be in many place full of great stone , which great hinder and trouble those that go down the river . Theise boat serve but for one voyage down the river unto a village call feluchia , because it be impossible to bring they up the river back again . at Feluchia the merchant pluck their boat in piece , or else sell they for a small price , for that at by | our they cost the merchant forty or fifty chicken a ' piece , and they sei they at Feluchia for seven or Feluchia a eight chicken a piece , because that when the merchant on return from Babylon back again , if they have mar - ' chandise or good that owe custom , than they make their return in forty day through the wilderness , pass that way with a great deal lesser charge than the other way . and if they have not merchandise that owe custom , than they go by the way of mosul , mosul . where it cost they great charge both the carovan and company . from by | our where the merchant embark [ ii i . 214 . ] themselves to Feluchia over against Babylon , if the river have good store of water , they shall make their voyage in fifteen or eighteen day down the river , and if the water be low , and it have not rain , than it be 367 much trouble , and it will be forty or fifty day journey down , because that when the bark strike on the stone that be in the river , than they must unlade they , which be great trouble , and then lade they again when they have mend they : therefore it be not necessary , neither do the merchant go with one boat alone , but with two or three , that if one boat split and be lose with strike on the sholde , they may have another ready to take in their good , until such time as they have mend the break boat , and if they draw the break boat on land to mend she , it be hard to defend she in the night from the great multitude of arabian that will come down there to rob you : and in the river every night , when you
