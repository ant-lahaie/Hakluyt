, because the people of Africa , especial the ethiopian , be so coal black , and their hair like wool curl short , which blackness and curl hair they suppose to come only by the parch heat of the sun , which how it shall be possible i can see : for even under the equinoctial in America , and in the east Indies , and in the hand Moluccae the people be not black , but tauney and white , with long hair uncurl as we have , so that if the ethiopian blackness ethiopian come by the heat of the sun , why shall not those Americans and Indians also be as black as they , see ’ the sun be equal distant from they both , they abide in one parallel : for the concave and convex superficies of the orb of the sun be concentrike , and equidistant to the earth ; except any man shall imagine somewhat of aux solis , and oppositum , which indifferent may be apply aswell to the one place as to the other . but the sun be think to give no otherwise heat , but by way of angle in reflection , and not by his nearness to the earth : for throughout all Africa , yea in the midst of the middle zone , and in all other place upon the top of mountain there lie con - ume tinuall snow , which be near to the orb of the sun , ^ ateth not then the people be in the valley , by so much as the but oneiy height of these mountain amount unto , and yet the reflection . sun notwithstanding his nearness , can not melt the snow for want of convenient place of reflection . also 261 a black moor son bear in England . the colour of the people in Meta incognita . the complexion of the people of Meta incognita . the middle region of the air where all the hail , frost , and snow be engender , be near unto the sun then the earth be , and yet there continue perpetuali cold , because there be nothing that the sun beam may reflect against , whereby appear that the nearness of the body of the sun work nothing . therefore to return again to the black moor . i my self have see a ethiopian as black as a coal bring into England , who take a fair english woman to wife , beget a son in all respect as black as the father be , although England be his native country , and a english woman his mother : whereby it seem this blackness proceed rather of some natural infection of that man , which be so strong , that neither the nature of the climb , neither the good complexion of the mother concur , can any thing alter , and therefore , we can impute it to the nature of the climb . and for a more fresh example , our people of Meta incognita ( of who and for who this discourse be take in hand ) that be bring this last year into England , be all general of the same colour that many nation be , lie in the midst of the middle zone . and this their colour be not only in the face which be subject to sun and air , but also in their body , which be still cover with garment as we be , yea the very suck child of twelve month age have his skin of the very same colour that most have under the equinoctial , which thing can proceed by reason of the climb , for that they be at least ten degree more towards the north than we in England be , no , the sun never come near their zenith by fourty degree : for in effect , they be within three or four degree of that which they call the freeze zone , and as i say , fourty degree from the burn zone , whereby it follow , that there be some other cause then the climate or the son perpendicular reflection , that shall cause the ethiopian great blackness . and the most probable cause to my judgement be , that this blackness proceed of some 262 natural infection of the first inhabitant of that country , and so all the whole progeny of they descend , be still pollute with the same blot of infection . therefore it shall not be far from our purpose , to examine the first originali of these black man , and how by a lineali descent they have hitherto continue thus black . it manifest and plain appear by holy scripture , the cause of that after the generail inundation and overflow of EthwPians the earth , there remain no more man alive but no ‘ and his three son , Sem , cham , and Japhet , who only be leave to possess and inhabit the whole face of the earth : therefore all the sundry descent that until this present day have inhabit the whole earth , must needs come of the offspring either of Sem , cham , or Japhet , as the only son of Noe , who all three be white , and their wife also , by course of nature shall have beget and bring forth white child . but the envy of our great and continual enemy the wicked spirit be such , that as he can not suffer our old father Adam to live in the felicity and angellike state wherein he be first create , but tempt he , seek and procure his ruin and fall : so again , find at this flood none but a father and three son live , he so cause one of they to transgress and disobey his father commandment , that after he all his posterity shall be accurse . the fact of disobedience be this : when the ark of Noe at the commandment of God have make the ark and enter therein , and the floodgate of heaven be open , so that the whole face of the earth , every tree and mountain be cover with abundance of water , he straite command his son and their wife , that they shall with reverence and fear behold the justice and mighty power of God , and that during the
