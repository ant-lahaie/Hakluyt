And baatu command saying : let 275 the two priest and the interpreter go together , but let the clerk return unto Sartach . And come again unto we , he tell we even so . and when i will have speak for the clerk to have have he with we , he say : no more word : for baatu have resolve , that so it shall be , and therefore i dare not go unto the court any more . goset the clerk have remain of the alm money bestow upon he , 26 . Yperperas , and no more ; 10 . whereof he keep for himself and for the lad , and 16 . he give unto the man of God for we . and thus be we part asunder with tear : he return unto the court of Sartach , and our self remain still in the same place . of our journey towards the court of Mangu can .
