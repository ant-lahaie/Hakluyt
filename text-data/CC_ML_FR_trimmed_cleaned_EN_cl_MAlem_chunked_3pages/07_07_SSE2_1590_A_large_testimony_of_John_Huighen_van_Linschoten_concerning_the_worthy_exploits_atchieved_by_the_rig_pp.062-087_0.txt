a large testimony of John Huighen van linschoten Hollander , concern the worthy exploit achieve by the right honourable the earl of Cumberland , by sir Martine Frobisher , sir Richard Greenvile , and diverse other English captain , about the isle of the azore , and upon the coast of Spain and Portugal , in the year 1589 , 1590 , 1591 , etc record in his excellent discourse of voyage to the east and west Indies , cap . 96 . 97 . and 99 he 22 of July 1589 about evening , be by the island of Flores and Corvo , we perceive 3 ship that make towards we , which come from under the land , which put we in great fear : for they come close by our admiral , and shoot diverse time at he , and at another ship of our company , whereby we perceive they to be Englishman , for they bear a english flag upon their 62 linschoten â€™ s large testimony a . d . 1589 - 91 . main top , but none of they show to be above 60 ton in greatness . about evening they follow after we , and all night bear lantern with candle burn in they at their sterne , although the moon shine . the same night pass hard by the island of Fayal , the next day be between the island of S . George that lie on our right hand , and the small island call Graciosa on our left hand , we espy the 3 english ship still follow we you take counsel together , whereof one sail backward , think that some other ship have come after we without company , and for a time be out of sight , but it be not long before it come again to you other two , wherewith they take counsel and come all 3 together against our ship , because we lay in the lee of all our ship , and have you island of S . George on the one side in stead of a sconce , think to deal so with we , that in you end we shall be constrain to run upon the shore , whereof we want not much , and in that manner with their [ ii two . 179 . ] flag open display , come lusty towards we , sound their trumpet , and sail at the least three time about we , beat we with musket and caliver , and some great piece , and do we not hurt in the body of our ship , but spoil all our sail and rope , and to conclude , we be so plague by they , that no man dare put forth his head , and when we shoot off a piece , we have at the least a hour work to lade it again , whereby we have so great a noise and cry in the ship , as if we have all be cast away , whereat the english man themselves begin to mock we , and with a thousand jest word call unto we . in the mean time the other ship hoist all their sail , and do the best they can to sail to the island of Tercera , not look once behind they to help we , doubt they shall come too late thither , not care for we , but think themselves to have do sufficient so they save their own stake , whereby it may easy be see what company they keep one with the other , and what order be among they . in the end the english man perceive small advantage against we , ( little know in what case and fear we be , as also because we be not far from Tercera ) leave we , which make we not a little to rejoice , as think our self to be rise from death to life , although we be not well assure , neither yet void of fear till we lay in the road before Tercera , and under the safety of the Portugal fort , and that we may get thither in good time we make all the sail we can : on the other side we be in great doubt , because we know not what they do in the island , nor whither they be our friend or enemy , and we doubt so much the more , because we find no man of war nor any caravel of advice from portingal , as we make our account to do , that may convoy we from thence , or give we advise , as in that country ordinary they use to do : and because the english - man have be so victorious in those part , it make we suspect that it go not well with Spain : they of the island of Tercera be in no less fear than we , for see our fleet , they think we to be Englishman , and that we come to overrun the island , because the 3 . Englishmen have bind up their flag , and come in company with we : for the which cause the island send out two caravel that lie there with advise from the king , for the indian ship that shall come thither . those caravel come to view we , and perceive what we be , make after we , whereupon . the english ship leave we , and make towards they , because the caravel think they to be friend , and shun they not , as suppose they to be of our company , but we shoot four or five time and make sign unto they that they shall make towards the island , which they present do . the Englishman perceive that , do put forward into the sea , and so the caravel hoard we tell we that the man of the island be all in arm , as have receive advice from Portugal , that sir Francis Drake be in readiness , and will come unto those island . they likewise bring we news of the overthrow of the spanish fleet before England , and that the english man have be before the gate of Lisbon : whereupon the king give we commandment that we shall put into the island of Tercera , and there lie under the safety of the castle until we receive further advise what we shall do , or whether we shall sail : for that they think it too dangerous for we to go to Lisbon . those news put our fleet in great fear , and make we look upon each other not know what to say , as be dangerous for they to put into the road , because it lie open to the sea : so that the indian ship , although they have express commandment from the king , yet they dare not anchor there , but only use to come thither , and
