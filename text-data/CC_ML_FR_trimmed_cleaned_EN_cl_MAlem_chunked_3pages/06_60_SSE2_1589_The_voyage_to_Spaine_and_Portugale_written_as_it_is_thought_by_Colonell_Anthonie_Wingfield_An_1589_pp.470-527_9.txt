next day be the eight of may , we embark our army without loss of a man , which ( have we not beat the enemy at Puente de Burgos ) have be impossible to have do ; for that without doubt they will have attempt something against we in our embark : as appear by the report of the commissary aforesaid , who confess , that the first night of our land the mark of Seralba write to the conde de Altemira , the conde de Andrada , and to ternei de Santisso , to bring all the force against we that they 494 can possible raise , think no way so good to assure that place , as to bring a army thither , wherewithal ! they may either besiege we in their base town , if we shall get it , or to lie between we and our place of embark , to fight with we upon the advantage ; for they have above 15000 soldier under their commandments . after we have put from thence , we have the wind so contrary , as we can not under nine day recover the burling : in which passage on the thirteenth day the earl of Essex , and with he m . Walter Devereux his brother ( a gendeman of wonder great hope ) sir Roger William colonel generail of the footman , sir Philip butler , who have always be most inward with he , and sir Edward Wingfield , come into the fleet . the earl have put himself into the journey against the opinion of the world , and as it seem to the hazard of his great fortune , though to the great advancement of his reputation , ( for as the honourable carriage of himself towards all man do make he high esteem at home ; so do his exceed forwardness in all service make he to be wonder at among we ) who , i say , put oflf in the same wind from Falmouth , that we leave Plymouth in , where he lie , because he will avoid the importunity of messenger that be daily send for his return , and some other cause more secret to himself , not know ( as it seem ) what place the general purpose to land in , have be as far as Cadiz in Andaluzia , and lie up and down about the south cape , where he take some ship lade with corn , and bring they unto the fleet . also in his return from thence to meet with our fleet , he fall with the hand of Bayon ; and on that side of the river which Cannas stand upon , he , with sir Roger Williams , and those gentleman that be with he go on shore , with some man out of the ship he be in , who the enemy , that hold guard upon that coast , will not abide , but flee up into the country . 495 the 16 day we land at Peniche in Portugal , under the shot of the castle , and above the waste in water , more than a mile from the town , wherein many be in peril of drown , by reason the wind be great , and the sea go high , which overthrow one boat , wherein five and twenty of captain dolphin man perish . the enemy be five company of Spaniards under the commandment of the conde de Fuentes , sally out of the town against we , and in our land make their approach close by the water side . but the earl of Essex with sir Roger Williams , and his brother , have land sufficient number to make two troop , leave one to hold the way by the water side , and lead the other over the sandhil ; which the enemy see , draw they likewise further into the land ; not , as we conjecture , to encounter we , but indeed to make their speedy passage away : notwithstanding , they do it in such sort , as be charge by we which be send out by the colonel generail under captain Jackson , they stand the same even to the push of the pike : in which charge and at the push , captain Robert piew be slay . the enemy be flee further than we have reason to follow they , all our company be draw to the town ; which be unfortified in any place , we find undefended by any man against we . and therefore the general cause the castle to be summon that night ; which be abandon by he that command it , a Portugal name Antonio de Aurid , be possess thereof , desire but to be assure that don Antonio be land , whereupon he will deliver the same ; which he honest perform . there be take out of the castle some hundred shot and pike , which don Emanuel furnish his Portugal withal , and twenty barrel of powder : so as possess both the town and the castle , we rest there one day : wherein some friar and other poor man come unto their new king , promise in the name of their country next adjoin , that within two day he shall have a good supply of horse and foot for his assistance . that 496 day we remain there , the general company of horse be unship . the general there full resolve , that the army shall march over land to Lisbon under the conduct of general Norris ; and that general drake shall meet he in the river thereof with the fleet ; that there shall be one company of foot leave in guard of the castle , and six in the ship : also that the sick and hurt shall remain there with provision for their cure . the general , to try the event of the matter by expedition , the next day begin to march in this sort : his own regiment , and the regiment of sir Roger Williams , sir Henry Norris , colonel lane , and colonel medkerk , in the vanguard : general drake , colonel Devereux , sir Edward Norris , and colonel sidnei in the battle : sir James hale , sir Edward Wingfield , colonel Umptons , colonel Huntley , and colonel bret in the arrereward . by that time our
