and a place where to repair our ship , which be so great bruise , that we be scarce able with our weary arm to keep forth the water : be thus oppress with famine on the one side and danger of drown on the other , not know where to find relief , we begin to be in wonderful despair , and we be of many mind , among who there be a great many that do desire our general to set they on land , make their choice rather to submit themselves to the mercy of the savage or infidel , then long to 408 hazard themselves at sea , where they very well see , that if they shall remain together , if they perish not by drown , yet hunger will enforce they in the end to eat one another : to which request our general do very willing agree , consider with himself that it be necessary for he to lessen his number , both for the safety of himself and they rest : and thereupon be resolve to set half his people ashore that he have then leave alive , it be a world to see how sudden man mind be alter : for they which a little before desire to be set on land , be now of another mind , and request rather to stay : by mean where - [ three . 474 - . ] of our general be enforce for the more contentation of all man mind , and to take away all occasion of offence , to take this order : first he make choice of such person of service and account , as be needful to stay , and that be do , of those which be willing to go he appoint such as he think may be best spare , and present appoint that by the boat they shall be set on shore , our general promise we that the next year he will either come himself , or else send to fetch we home . here again it will have cause any stony heart to have relent to hear the pitiful moan that many do make , and how loath they be to depart : the weather be then somewhat stormy and tempestuous , and therefore we be to pass with great danger , yet notwithstanding there be no remedy , but we that be appoint to go away , must of necessity do so . howbeit those that go they be put in the first boat be safe set on shore , but of they » » 2 5 which go in the second boat , of which number i ' ' ™ rth - my self be one , the sea wrought so high , that we panucj0 t } ie 8 can not attain to the shore , and therefore we be of October constrain through the cruel deal of John Hampton 1568 . captain of the minion , and John Sanders boatswain of the Jesus , and Thomas Pollard his mate , to leap out of the boat into the main sea , have moor then a mile to shore , and so to shift for our self , and either 409 Chichimici a ■ warlike and truel people . to sink or swim . and of those that so be ( as it be ) throw out , and compel to leap into the sea , there be two drown , which be of captain blands man . in the evening of the same day , it be Monday the eight of October , 1568 , when we be all come to shore , we find fresh water , whereof some of our man drink so much , that they have almost cast themselves away , for we can scarce get life of they for the space of two or three hour after : other sum be so cruel swell , what with the drink in of the salt water , and what with the eat of the fruit which we find on land , have a stone in it much like a almond ( which fruit be call capule ) that they be all in very ill case , so that we be in a manner all of we both feeble , faint and weak . the next morning be Tewsday , the nine of October , we think it best to travel along by the sea coast , to seek out some place of habitation : ( whether they be Christians or Savages , we be indifferent , so that we may have wherewithal ! to sustain our hungry body ) and so depart from a hill where we have rest all night , not have any dry thread about we , ( for those that be not wet being not throw into the sea , be thorough wet with rain , for all the night it rain cruel : ) as we go from the hill , and be come into the plain , we be great trouble to pass for the grass and weed that grow there high than any man . on the left hand we have the sea , and upon the right hand great wood , so that of necessity we must needs pass on our way westward , through those marsh ; and go thus , sudden we be assault by the Indians , a warlike kind of people , which be in a manner as cannibal , although they do not feed upon man flesh as cannibal do . these people be call Chichimici , and they use to wear their hair long , even down to their knee , they do also colour their face green , yellow , red and blue , 410 which make they to seem very ugly and terrible to behold . Theise people do keep war against the Spaniard , of who they have be oftentimes very cruel handle : for with the Spaniard there be no mercy . they perceive we at our first come on land , suppose we to have be their enemy , the border Spaniards , and have by their forerunner descry what number we be , and how feeble and weak without armour or weapon , they sudden accord to their accustom manner , when they encounter with any people in warlike sort , raise a terrible and huge cry , man as and so come run fierce
