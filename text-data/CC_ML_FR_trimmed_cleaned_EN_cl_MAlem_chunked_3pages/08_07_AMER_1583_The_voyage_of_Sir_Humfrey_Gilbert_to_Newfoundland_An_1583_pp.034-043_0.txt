a report of the voyage and success thereof , attempt in the year of our lord 1583 by sir Humphrey Gilbert knight , with other gentleman assist he in that action , intend to discover and to plant Christian inhabitant in place convenient , upon those large and ample country extend northward from the cape of Florida , lie under very temperate clime , esteem fertile and rich in mineral , yet not in the actuali possession of any christian prince , write by m . Edward Haie gentleman , and principali actor in the same voyage , who alone continue unto the end , and by God speciali assistance return home with his retinue safe and entire . any voyage have be pretend , yet hitherto never any thorough accomplish by our nation of exact discovery into the bowel of those main , ample and vast country , extend infinite into the north from 30 degree , or rather from 25 degree of septentrionali latitude , neither have a right way be take of plant a christian habitation and regiment upon the same , as well may appear both by the little we yet do actual possess therein , and by our ignorance of the riches and secret within those land , which unto this day we know chief by the travel and report of other nation , and most of the french , who albeit they can not challenge such right and interest unto the say country as we , neither these many year have have opportunity nor mean so great to discover and to plant ( be vex with the calamity of intestine war ) as we have have by the inestimable benefit of our long and happy peace : yet have they both way perform more , and have long since attain a sure possession and settle government of many province in those northerly part of America , if their many attempt into those foreign and remote land have not be impeach by their garboil at home . the first discovery of these coast ( never hear of C0 ^ t5 0 before ) be well begin by John Cabot the father , and Sebastian his son , a Englishman bear , who be the first discover first finder out of all that great tract of land stretch by the english from the cape of Florida unto those island which we nation . now call the Newfoundland : all which they bring and annex unto the crown of England . since when , if with like diligence the search of inland country have be follow , as the discovery upon the coast , and outpart thereof be perform by those two man : no doubt her majesty territory and revenue have be mighty enlarge and advance by this day . and which be more ; the seed of christian religion have be sow among those pagan , which by this time may have bring forth a most plentiful harvest and copious congregation of Christians ; which must be the chief intent of such as shall make any attempt that way : or else whatsoever be build upon other foundation shall never obtain happy success nor continuance . and although we can not precise judge ( which only belong to God ) what have be the humour of man stir up to great attempt of discover and plant in those remote country , yet the event do show that either god cause have not be chief prefer by they , or else God have not permit so abundant grace as the light of his word and knowledge of he to be yet reveal unto those infidel before the appoint time . but most assure , the only cause of religion hitherto have keep back , and will also bring forward at the time assign by God , a effectual and complete discovery and possession by Christians both of those ample country and the riches within they hitherto conceal : whereof notwithstanding God in his wisdom have permit to 35 probable conjecturesy â€˜ these land north of Florida , be reservedfor the english nation to possess . be reveal from time to time a certain obscure and misty knowledge , by little and little to allure the mind of man that way ( which else will be dull enough in the zeal of his cause ) and thereby to prepare we unto a readiness for the execution of his will against the due time ordain , of call those pagan unto Christianity . in the mean while , it behoove every man of great call , in who be any instinct of inclination unto this attempt , to examine his own motion : which if the same proceed of ambition or avarice , he may assure himself it come not of God , and therefore can not have confidence of God protection and assistance against the violence ( else irresistible ) both of sea , and infinite peril upon the land ; who God yet may use a instrument to further his cause and glory some way , but not to build upon so bad a foundation . otherwise , if his motive be derive from a virtuous and heroical mind , prefer chief the honour of God , compassion of poor infidel captive by the devil , tyrannize in most wonder and dreadful manner over their body and soul ; advancement of his honest and well dispose countryman , will to accompany he in such honourable action ; relief of sundry people within this realm distress : all these be honourable purpose , imitate the nature of the munificent God , wherewith he be well please , who will assist such a actor beyond expectation of man . and the same , who feel this inclination in himself , by all likelihood may hope , or rather confident repose in the preordinance of God , that in this last age of the world ( or likely never ) the time be complete of receive also these gentile into his mercy , and that God will raise he a instrument to effect the same : it seem probable by event of precedent attempt make by the Spaniard and french sundry time , that the country lie north of Florida , God have reserve the same to be reduce unto christian civility by the english nation . for not long after that Christopher Columbus have discover the island and continent of the Spaniard prosperous in the southern discovery , yet unhappy in these northern . sir Humphrey Gilbert the west Indies for Spain , John and Sebastian Cabot make discovery also of the rest from Florida northwards to the behoof of England . and whensoever afterward the Spaniard ( very prosperous in all their southern discovery ) do attempt any thing into Florida and those region incline towards the north , they prove most unhappy , and be at length discourage utter by the hard and lamentable success of many both religious and valiant in arm , endeavour to bring those northerly region also under the spanish jurisdiction ; as if God have prescribe limit unto the spanish nation which they may not exceed : as by their own gest record may be apt gather . the french , as they can pretend less title unto these northern part then the Spaniard , by how much the Spaniard make the first discovery of the same continent usurper upon so far northward as unto Florida , and the french do but our right . review that before discover
