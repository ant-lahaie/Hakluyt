D . 1575 - 80 . i have always a longing and desire to this my native country : and , to return and serve again in the mine where i may have gather great riches and wealth , i very well see that at one time or another i shall fall again into the danger of that devilish inquisition , and so be strip of all , with loss of life also , and therefore i make my choice rather to learn to weave Grogranes and taffeta , and so compound with a silk - weaver , i bind my self for three year to serve he , and give he a hundred and fifty pezo to teach i the science , otherwise he will not have teach i under seven year prenticeship , and by this mean i live the more quiet , and free from suspicion . howbeit i shall many time be charge by familiar of that devilish house , that i have a meaning to run away into England , and to be a heretic Lutherane again : to who i will answer that they have no need to suspect any such thing in i , for that they know all very well that it be impossible for i to escape by any manner of mean : yet notwithstanding i be call before the inquisitor , and demand why i do not marry : i
