- shotte , and such like heavy thing , throw here and there , almost overgrow with grass and weed . from thence we go along by the water side , towards the point of the creek to see if we can find any of their boat or pinnisse , but we can perceive no sign of they , nor any of the last falcon and small ordinance which be leave with they , at my departure from they . at our return from the creek , some of our sailor meet we , tell we that they have find where diverse chest have be hide , and long sithence dig up again and break up , and much of the good in they spoil and scatter about , but nothing leave , of such thing as the savage know any use of , undefaced . present captain cook and i go to the place , which be in the end of a old trench , make two year pass by captain Amadas : wheere we find five chest , that have be careful hide of the planter , and of the same chest three be my own , and about the place Viii 417 2d many of my thing spoil and break , and my book tear from the cover , the frame of some of my picture and map rot and spoil with rain , and my armour almost eat through with rust ; this can be no other but the deed of the Savages our enemy at Dasamongwepeuk , who have watch the departure of our man to croatoan ; and assoon as they be depart , dig up every place where they suspect any thing to be bury : but although it much grieve i to see such spoil of my good , yet on the other side i great joy that i have safe find a certain token of their safe be at croatoan , which be the place where Manteo be bear , and the savage of the hand our friend . when we have see in this place so much as we can , we return to our boat , and depart from the shore towards our ship , with as much speed as we can : for the weather begin to overcast , and very likely that a foul and stormy night will ensue . therefore the same evening with much danger and labour , we get our self aboard , by which time the wind and sea be so great rise , that we doubt our cable and anchor will scarce hold until morning : wherefore the captain cause the boat to be man with five lusty man , who can swim all well , and send they to the little hand on the right hand of the harbour , to bring aboard six of our man , who have fill our cask with fresh water : the boat the same night return aboard with our man , but all our cask ready fill they leave behind , unpossible to be have aboard without danger of cast away both man and boat : for this night prove very stormy and foul . the next morning it be agree by the captain and my self , with the master and other , to weigh anchor , and go for the place at croatoan , where our planter be : for that then the wind be good for that place , and also to leave that cask with fresh water on shore in the hand until our return . so then 418 they bring the cable to the Capston , but when the anchor be almost apecke , the cable break , by mean whereof we lose another anchor , wherewith we drive so fast into the shore , that we be force to let fall a three anchor : which come so fast home that the ship be almost aground by Kenricks mount : so that we be force to let slip the cable end for end . and if it have not chance that we have fall into a channel of deep water , close by the shore than we account of , we can never have go clear of the point that lie to the southward of Kenricks mount . be thus clear of some danger , and get into deep water , but not without some loss : for we have but one cable and anchor leave we of four , and the weather grow to be foul and foul ; our victual scarce , and our cask and fresh water lose : it be therefore determine that we shall go for saint John or some other hand to the southward for fresh water . and it be further purpose , that if we can any way supply our want of victual and other necessary , either at Hispaniola , Sant John , or Trynidad , that than we shall continue in the Indies all the winter follow , with hope to make 2 . rich voyage of one , and at our return to visit our countryman at Virginia . the captain and the whole company in the admiral ( with my earnest petition ) thereunto agree , so that it rest only to know what the master of the moonlight our consort will do herein . but when we demand they leave the coast of Virpnia , they if they will accompany we in that new determination , they allege that their weak and leak ship be not able to continue it ; wherefore the same night we part , leave the moonlight to go direct for England , and the admiral set his course for Trynidad , which course we keep two day . on the 28 . the wind change , and it be set on foul weather every way : but this storm bring the wind west and northwest , and blow so forcible , that we be able to bear no sail , but our forecourse 419 half mast high , wherewith we run upon the wind perforce , the due course for England , for that we be drive to change our first determination for Trynidad , and stand for the hand of azore , where we purpose to take in fresh water , and also there hope to meet with some english man of war about those hand , at who hand
