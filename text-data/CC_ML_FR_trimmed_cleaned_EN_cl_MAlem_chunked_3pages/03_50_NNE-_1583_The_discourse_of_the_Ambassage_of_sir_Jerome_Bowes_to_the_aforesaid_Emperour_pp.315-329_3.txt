, what for the love he bear to her majesty , and the 325 particular like he have of himself , he now fall into the hand of his great enemy , Mekita Romanovich and Andre Shalkan the chancellor , who , after the death of the emperor , take the speciali government upon themselves , and so present cause the ambassador to be shut up a close prisoner in his own house , for the space of nine week , and be so straight guard and bad use by those that attend he , as he daily suspect some further mischief to have follow : for in this time there grow a great uproar in Moscow of nigh twenty thousand person , which remember that his enemy reign , somewhat amaze the ambassador , but yet afterward the matter fall out against that great counsellor Bodan Belskoy , who i note before to be a special man in the old emperor favour : who be now notwithstanding so outrageous assault , as that he be force to seek the emperor chamber for his safety , and be afterward send away to Cazan , a place he have in government , five hundred mile from Moscow , where he have remain ever since , and never as yet call again to court , at which time the ambassador expect some such like measure , and prepare himself aswell as he can , for his defence : yet happy after this , be send for to court , to have his dispatch , and to take his leave of the emperor : whither be conduct ( not after the wont manner ) and bring to the council chamber , come to he only Shalkan the chancellor and a brother of he , who without more ado , tell he for the sum of his dispatch , that this emperor will not treat of further amity with the queen his mistress , than such as be between his late father and she , before his come thither : and will not hear any reply to be make by the ambassador , but present cause both himself and all his company to be disarm of their weapon , and go towards the emperor . in which passage there be such outrage offer he , as have he not use more patience than his disposition afford he , or the occasion require , he have not in likelihood escape with life , but 326 yet at length be bring to the presence of the emperor , who say nothing to he , but what the chancellor have already do , but offer he a letter to carry to her majesty , which the ambassador ( for that he know it contain nothing that do concern his ambassage ) refuse till he see his danger grow too great : neither will the emperor suffer the ambassador to reply aught , nor well he can , for they have now of purpose take away his interpretor , be yet unwilling ( as it seem , and suspect the ambassador purpose ) that the emperor and other shall know how dishonourble he have be handle : for there be at that time , in that presence a noble brave gentleman , one Boris the great Pheodorovich Godenoe , brother to the emperor that now en ^ s0 ^ be , who yet after the death of the emperor do always pheQ ^ rovich use the ambassador most honorable , and will very willing have do he much more kindness , but his authority be not yet , till the coronation of the emperor : but notwithstanding he send often unto he , not long before his departure , and accompany his many honourable favour with a present of two fair piece of cloth of gold , and a timber of very good sable : and desire that as there be kindness and brotherhood betwixt the emperor and her majesty , so there may be love and brotherhood betwixt he and the ambassador . save from this man , there be now no more favour nor friendship leave for the ambassador in Moscovia : for the chancellor Shalkan have now send he word that the english emperor be dead : he have now nothing offer he but danger and disgrace too many , and a hasty dispatch from the Moscow , that he may not tarry the coronation of the new emperor : offence many in his preparation for his long journey , only one mean gentleman appoint to accompany he to the sea side , expect daily in his passage some sudden revenge to be do upon he , for so he understand it be threaten before his come from the Moscow , and therefore with resolution provide by all the mean 327 he may , by himself and his servant for his defence ( for now be his danger know such , as the english merchant do altogether leave he , although he command they in her majesty name to accompany he ) that if any such thing shall happen to be offer he , as many of they as he can that shall offer to execute it , shall die with he for company : which be perceive be think to make his passage the safe . so afterward be drive to digest many injury by the way , at length he recover S . Nicholas , where remember his unfortunate loss of the old emperor , and his ill usage since then at the Moscow , he be force to take a bare letter for the sum of his dispatch , containing nothing of that he come for , and the poor and disgraceful present send he ( in the name of the emperor ) in respect of that that be mean he by the old emperor , know all these to be do in disgrace of her majesty and himself , determine now to be discharge of some part of they in such sort as he can , and so provide as he may to prevent his danger , in get to his ship , furnish and place his man to answer any assault that shall be offer he , after he have bid farewell to the uncourteous gentleman that bring he thither , by three or four of the valiant and discreet man he have , he send to be deliver he or leave at his lodging , his master weak letter , and worse present , and so afterward happy ( though hardly ) recover his ship in safety , although present afterward , there be great hurly burly after he , to force he to receive the same again , but fail of their purpose .
