take to carry unto their ship . in you mean while they espy certain cottage , which the pilot determine to go and see , and be come near they see 3 other raft with 3 Indians on they distant from the cottage one or two cross - bowe shoot , ix 241 queen and he leap on land with 4 or 5 mariner in his company : and while they behold those cottage , they see many Indians descend down a small hill in warlike manner with their bow and arrow , whereupon they determine to retire to their boat , and to return to their ship , and they be not go from the seashore scarce a stone cast , but the indian be come upon they to shoot at they with their arrow , and because they be unarm , they will not fight with they , have go on shore for no other purpose , but to sound the mouth and entrance of that lake . on Thursday the 4 of December we set sail with a fresh gale of wind , and sail some 8 or 10 league , and come unto certain mouth or inlet which seem to all of we as though they have be hand , and we enter into one of they , Baya deal and come into a haven which we call Baya deal Abad Abad it100 ap inc [ ose ( l anj compass with land , be one of they the point of fair haven that have be see : and about the same , California . especial on both side the land be green and goodly to behold ; we descry certain river on that part which seem green , and therefore we return back , go out at that mouth whereby we come in , always have contrary wind : yet the pilot use their best endeavour to make way : and we see before we certain woody hill , and beyond they certain plain ; this we see from the Friday the 5 of the say month , until the Tuesday , which be the nine . as we draw near to these wood they seem very pleasant , and there be goodly and large hill and beyond they towards the sea be certain plain , and through all the country we see these wood . many great from the day before , which be the conception of our tmoke , of lady , we see many great smoke , whereat we much Francis gualle marvel , be or diverse opinion among our self , make man - whether those smoke be make by the inhabitant of cion . the country or no . over against these wood there fall every night such a dew , that every morning when we rise , the deck of the ship be so wet , that until the sun be of a good height , we always make the 242 deck dirty with go upon it . we ride over against these wood from the Tuesday morning when we set sail , until Thursday about midnight , when a cruel northwest wind take we , which , whither we will or no , enforce we to way our anchor ; and it be so great , that the ship Santa Agueda begin to return back , until her cable break , and the ship hull , and sudden with a great gust the trinket and the mizzen be rend asunder , then northwest wind still grow more and more : within a short while after the main sail be rend with a mighty flaw of wind , so that we be enforce , both soldier , captain , and all of we , to do our best endeavour to mend our sail ; and the Trinity be drive to do the like , for she go round upon her anchor , when she come ahead of it , her cable break , so that there we lose two anchor , each ship one . we go back to seek Baya deal Abad , for we be within 20 league of the same , and this day we come within four league of it , and be not able to reach it by reason of contrary wind , we ride under the lee of certain mountain and hill which be bare , and almost void of grass , near unto a strand full of sandy hill . near unto this road we find a fishingplace under a point afishingplace . of land , where have let down our lead to see what ground be there , a fish catch it in his mouth , and begin to draw it , and he which hold the sounding - lead cry and show his fellow that it be catch , that they may help he , as soon as he have get it above the water , take the fish , and loose the cord of the sounding - lead , and throw it again into the sea , to see whither there be any good depth , and it be catch again , whereupon he begin to cry for help , and all of we make a shout for joy ; thus draw the fish the rope of the sounding - lead be very great be crack , but at length we catch the fish which be very fair . here we stay from Friday when we arrive there , until the Monday , when as it seem good to our captain , that we shall repair to the water place , from whence 243 we be some six league distant , to take in 12 buttes of water , which we have drink and spend , because he know not whither we shall from thenceforth find any water , or no ; and though we shall find water , it be doubtful whither we shall be able to take it by reason great tide of the great tide that go upon that coast . we draw upon this coast . near to that place on Monday at night , when as we see certain fire of the Indians . and on Tuesday morning our general command that the Trinity shall come as near our ship and to the shore as it can , that if we have need , they may help we with their great ordinance : and have make 3 or 4 bourd to draw near the shore , there come 4 or 5 Indians to the seaside ; who stand and behold while
