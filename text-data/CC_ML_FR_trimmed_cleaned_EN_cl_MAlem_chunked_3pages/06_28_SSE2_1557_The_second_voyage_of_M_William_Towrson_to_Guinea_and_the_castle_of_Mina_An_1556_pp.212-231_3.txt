we warning to take heed to our self : we tell they again that we be very glad of their come , and will be ready at all time to meet they , and to assure they that we be glad of it , we sound our trumpet , and shoot off certain base whereof the negro be very glad , and request we that if the Portugal seek to hinder our traffic , to show they all the extremity that we can , promise we that if they come by land , they will advertise we thereof . the 24 we go a shore with our trumpet and drum , and traffic , and i bid the captain of the town to dinner . the 2 5 day we be a shore , our ship have descry five sail of the king of Portugal , and our ship shoot off ordinance to call we away , and we throw every man his cask a shore for water , and go to our ship , and by that time we have weigh and give order one to another what to do , it be night , so y â€˜ that night nothing be do . we set sail and lay close all night to get the 220 wind if we can : we be near some of they , and one shoot off a piece which we judge to be the admiral of the Portugal , to cause the rest to come and speak with he : so all this night we make our self ready for fight . the 26 we come in with the shore and have sight of the Portugal where they ride at anchor , and we bear with they , and we give all our man white scarffe , to the end that the Frenchman may know one the other if we come [ ii two . 40 . ] to board : but the night come upon we that we can not fetch they , but we anchor within demie - culverin shoot of they . the 27 day we weigh and so do the Portugal , and about eleven of the clock we have the wind of they , and then we go room with they , which when they perceive , they keep about to the shore again , and we after they , and when they be so near the shore that they can not well run any further on that board , they keep about again , and lie to the seaward , and then we keep about with they , and be a head of they , and take in our topsail and tarry for they : and the first that come up be a small bark which sail so well that she care not for any of we , and carry good ordinance : and assoon as she come up , she shoot at we , and overshoot we , and then she shoot at the admiral of the Frenchman , and shoot he through in two or three place , the fight with and go forth a head of we , because we be in our then portu5als - fighting sail : then come up another caravel under our lee in like case which shoot at we and at the Frenchman , and hurt two of his man and shoot he through the main mast . and after they come up the admiral under our lee also , but he be not able to do we so much harm as the small ship , because he carry ordinance high than they , neither be we able to make a good shot at any of they , because our ship be so weak in the side , that she lay all her ordinance in the sea : wherefore we think to lay the great ship aboard , and as soon as the french admiral go room with 221 he , he fall a stern and can not fetch he , and after he fall a stern of two caravel more and can fetch none of they , but fall to leeward of they all : and when he be to leeward , he keep about to the shoreward , and leave we , and then we put out our topsail and give they chase , and both the other Frenchmen keep the wind , and will not come near we , and our own ship be a stern so that she can not come to we : and after we have follow they about two hour to the seaward , they keep about again towards the shore , think to pay we as they go along by , and to have the wind of the french admiral which before run in towards the shore , and we keep about with they , and keep still the wind of they think that our viceadmiral and the other will have follow we as we will they to do : but after that the Portugal be pass by they , and every one have shoot at we and our vice - admiral , both our vice - admiral and the two Frenchman , and our own pinnace leave we in the lap , and run to seaward , and we run still along , and keep the wind of they to succour the french admiral , who be under all of their lees , and when they meet with he , every one go room with he , and give he the broad side , and after they cast about again , and dare not board he , because they see we in the weather of they , or else without doubt they have take or sink they , for three of they which be the small , go so fast that it be not possible for a ship to board they , and carry such ordinance that if they have have the weather of we , they will have trouble 3 of the best ship that we have , and as for their admiral and vice - admiral they be both notable appoint . when the Frenchman be clear of they , he lie as near the wind as he can , and we follow they still towards the shore , and then the admiral run to sea after the rest , and leave we all alone : and when the Portugal perceive that we be alone , and give they chase , they keep about with we and we with they , to keep the wind of they , and we run still within base 222 shoot of they , but they shoot not at we , because we have the weather of they , and see that they can do we no hurt : and thus we follow one another until night , and in the night we lose they ,
