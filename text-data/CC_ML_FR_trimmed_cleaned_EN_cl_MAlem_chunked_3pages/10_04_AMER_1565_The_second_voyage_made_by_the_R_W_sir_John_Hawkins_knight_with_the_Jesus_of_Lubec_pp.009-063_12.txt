away , and never see after . his nature be ever when he will have his prey , to cry and sob like a christian body , to provoke they to come to he , and then he snatch at they , and thereupon come this proverb that be apply unto woman when they weep , lachrymae Crocodili , the meaning whereof be , that as the crocodile when he cry , go then about most to deceive , so do a woman most common when she weep . of these the master of the Jesus watch one , and by the bank side strike he with a pike of a bill in the side , and after three or four time turn in sight , he sink down , and be not afterward see . in the time of our be in the river guinie , we see many of a monstrous bigness , among the which the captain be in one of the bark come down the same , shoot a falcon at one , which very narrow he miss , and with a fear he plunge into the water , make a stream like the way of a boat . now while we be here , whether it be of a fear that the Spaniard doubt we will have do they some harm before we depart , or for any treason that they intend towards we , i be not able to say ; but then come thither a captain from some of the other town , with a dozen soldier upon a time when our captain and the treasurer clear all thing between they , and be in a communication of a debt of the governor of Burboroata , which be to be pay by the say treasurer , who will not answer the same by any mean . whereupon certain word of displeasure pass betwixt the captain and he , and part the one from the other , the treasurer possible doubt that our captain will perforce have seek the same , do immediate command his man to arm , both horseman and footman : but because the captain be in the river on the back side of the town with his other boat , and all his man unarm and without weapon , it be to be judge he mean he little good , have that advantage of he , that come upon the sudden , he may have mischieve many of his man : but the captain have understanding thereof , not trust to their gentleness , if they may have the advantage , depart aboard his ship , and at night return again , and demand among other talk , what they mean by assemble their man in that order , and they answer , that their captain be come to town do muster his man accord to his accustom manner . but it be to be judge to be a cloak , in that come for that purpose he may have do it soon , but the truth be , they be not of force until then , whereby to enterprise any matter against we , by mean of pike and harquebuss , whereof they have want , and be now furnish by our captain , and also 3 . falcon , which have get in other place , they have secret convey thither , which make they the bold , and also for that they see now a convenient place to do such a feat , and time also serve thereunto , by the mean that our man be not only unarm and unprovide , as at no time before the like , but also be occupy in hew of wood , and least think of any harm : these be occasion to provoke they thereunto . and i suppose they go about to bring it to effect , in that * 1 with another gentleman be in the town , think of no harm towards we , and see man assemble in armour to the treasurer house , whereof i marveil , and revoke to mind the former talk between the captain and he , and the unreadiness of our man , of who advantage may have be take , depart out of the town immediate to give knowledge thereof , but before we come to our man by a flightshot , two horseman ride a gallop be come near we , be send , as we do guess , to stay we lest we shall carry news to our captain , but see we so near our man they stay their horse , come together , and suffer we to pass , belike because we be so near , that if they have go about the same , they have be espy by some of our man which then immediate will have depart , whereby they shall have be frustrate of their pretence : and so the two horseman rid about the bush to espy what we do , and see we go , to the intent they may shadow their come down in post , whereof suspicion may be have , feign a simple excuse in ask whether he can sell any wine , but that seem so simple to the captain , that stand in doubt of their courtesy , he return in the morning with his three boat , appoint with base in their nose , and his man with weapon accord , where as before he carry none : and thus dissemble all injury conceive of both part , the captain go ashore , leave pledge in the boat for himself , and clear all thing between the treasurer and he , save for the governors debt , which the one 1565 . by no mean will answer , and the other , because it be not his due debt , will not molest he for it , but be content to remit it until another time , and therefore depart , cause the two bark which ride near the shore to weigh and go under sail , which be do because that our captain demand a testimoniali of his good behaviour there , can not have the same until he be under sail ready to depart : and therefore at night he go for the same again , and receive it at the treasurer hand , of who very courteous he take his leave and depart , shoot off the base of his boat for his farewell , and the townsman also shoot off four falcon and 30 . harquebuss , and this be the first time that he know of the
