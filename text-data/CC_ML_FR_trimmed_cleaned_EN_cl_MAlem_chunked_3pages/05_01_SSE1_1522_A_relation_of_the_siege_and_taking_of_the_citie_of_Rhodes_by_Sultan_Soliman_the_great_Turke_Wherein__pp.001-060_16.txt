to make remedy of needful thing by counsel , call the lord of his council for to have advice in these do , and other . and when they be assemble , the lord propose the word that be to he denounce , and say : with these term and word come two or three merchant and citizen of the town that knock at the door of the council , and present a supplication to the great master , and lord of the council , whereby they require and beseech meek the say reverend lord to have respect to they and their poor household , and to make some appointment with the great Turk , see that the say matter be already forward in purpose , that he will do it ; and that it will please he to consider the piteous and sorrowful estate that the town be in ; and that there be no remedy to save it : and at the least way , if the lord will not make appointment , to give they leave ( of his goodness ) to have their wife and their child out of the road to save they , for they will not have they slay nor make slave to the enemy . and the conclusion be , that if the say lord will not purvey therefore , they will purvey for it themselves . and there be write in the say request the name of eight or ten of the rich of the town . which word of the say supplication be hear , the say lord and his council be abash and ill content as reason will , see that it be but a course game , and think on many thing to make answer to the say citizen , for to content and appease they : and also to see if they shall intend to the appointment , as they require , and after as the Genouoys have report : and the better to make the say answer , and to know more plain in what estate the town be in all thing : that be to wit , first of gunpowder , and then of man of war , and of the battery . also be demand and ask the lord of saint Giles pre John , which have the charge of the gunpowder , and then the captain sir Gabriel Martiningo , for be over their man of war ( as it be say ) as to he that know the truth ; if the town may hold or not , or there be any mean to save it . the say lord of saint Giles arise , say and affirm upon his honour and his conscience that almost all the slave and labourer be dead and hurt , and that scant there be folk enough to remove a piece of artillery from one place to another , and that it be unpossible without folk any more to make or set up the repair they which every day be break and crush by the great , furious , and continual shot of the enemy artillery . as for gunpowder the say lord say , that all that be for store in the town , be spend long ago , and that which be new bring , be not to serve and furnish two assault . and he see the great advantage of the enemy be so far within the town , without power to put or chase they away , for default of man , be of the opinion that the town will be lose , and that there be no mean to save it . the word of the say lord finish , the captain Gabriel Martiningo for his discharge say and declare to the reverend lord and they of the council , that see and consider the great beat of the shot that the town have suffer , and after see the enter which the enemy have so large , and that they be within the town by their trench both endlong and overthwart ; see also that in two other place they be at the foot of the wall , and that the most part of our knight and man of war and other be slay and hurt , and the [ ii i . 90 . ] gunpowder waste , and that it be unpossible for they to resist their enemy any more , that without doubt the town be lose if there come no succour for to help and resist the siege . the which opinion and reason of these two worthy man and expert in such feat , understand and ponder by the lord great master and the lord of the council , they be most part advise for to accept and take treaty if it be offer , for the safeguard of the common people , and of the holy relic of the church , as part of the holy cross , the holy throne , the hand of saint John , and part of his head , and diverse other relic . howbeit the lord great master to who the business belong very near , and that take it most heavy , and be more sorrowful than any of the other , as reason require , be always steadfast in his first purpose , rather will to die then to consent to such a thing , and say again to the lord of the council : advise you , and think well on every thing , and of the end that may happen , and he propose to they two point : that be to wit , whether it be better for we to die all , or to save the people and the holy relic . the which two point and doubt be long time dispute , and there be diverse opinion : nevertheless , at the last they say all , that howbeit that it be well and safe do to die for the faith , and most honour for we , notwithstanding see and consider that there be no remedy to resist against our enemy , and mean to save the town ; and on the other part , that the great Turk will not oppress we to forsake our faith , but only will have the town , it be much better then , and tend to great wealth to save all the jewel abovesaid , that shall be defile and lose if they come in the hand of the enemy
