the master and the pilot to make towards the hand , although the master refuse to do it , say , that they be most sure there to be cast away and utter spoil : but the captain call he drunkard and heretic , and strike he with a staff , command he to do as he will have he . the master see this and be compel to do it , say : well then my master , see it be the desire of you all to be cast away , i can but lose one life , [ ii two . 187 . ] and therewith desperate he sail towards the shore , and be on that side of the hand , where there be nothing else but hard stone and rock , as high as mountain , most terrible to behold , where some of the inhabitant stand with long rope and cork bind at the end thereof , to throw they down unto the man , that they may lay hold upon they , and save their life : but few of they get so near , most of they be cast away , and smite in piece before they can get to the wall . the ship sail in this manner ( as i say before ) towards the hand , and approach to the shore , the master be a old man , and full of year , call his son that be in the ship with he , and have embrace one another , and take their last farewell , the good old father will his son not to take care for he , but seek to save himself ; for ( say he ) son thou be young , and may have some hope to save thy life , but as for i it be no great matter ( i be old ) what become of i , and therewith each of these shed many tear , as every love father and kind child may well consider , the ship fall upon the cliff , and break in piece , the father on the one side , the son on the other side fall into the sea , each lay hold upon that which come next to hand , but to no purpose ; for the sea be so high and furious , that they be all drown , and only fourteen or fifteen save themselves by swim , with their leg and arm half break and out of joint , among which be the master son , and four other dutch boy : the rest of the Spaniard and sailor , with the captain and master , be drown . who heart will not melt with tear to behold so grievous a sight , special consider with himself that the great cause thereof be the beastliness and insolency of the Spaniard , as in this only example may well be see ? whereby may be consider how the other ship speed , as we our self do in part behold , and by the man that be save do hear more at large , as also some other of our countryman that as then be in the like danger can well witness . on the other hand the loss be no less than in Tercera : for on the hand of saint George there be two ship cast away : on the hand of Pico two ship : on the hand of gratiosa three ship : and beside those there come every where round about diverse piece of break ship , and other thing fleet towards the hand , wherewith the sea be all cover most pitiful to behold . on the hand of S . Michael there be four ship cast away , and between Tercera and S . Michael three moor be sink , which be see and hear to cry out ; whereof not one man be save . the rest put into the sea without mast , all turn and rend : so that of they above 100 whole fleet and armada , be 140 ship in all , there be but 32 or 33 arrive in Spain and Portugal , yea , and shlp ^ dnuned . those few with so great misery , pain and labour , that not two of they arrive there together , but this day one , and to morrow another , next day the three , and so one after the other to the number aforfesayd . all the rest be cast away upon the hand , and overwhelm in the sea , whereby may be consider what great loss and hindrance they receive at that time : for by many man judgement it be esteem to be much more than be lose by their army that come for England ; and it may well be think , and presume , that it be no other but a just plague purposely send by God upon the Spaniard , and that it may true be say , the take of the revenge be just revenge upon they , and not by the might or force of man , but by the power of God , as some of they open say in the lie of Tercera , that they 86 believe very God will consume they , and that he take part with the lutheran and heretic : say further that so soon as they have throw the dead body of the vice - admiral sir Richard Greenfield overboard , they very think that as he have a devilish faith and religion , and therefore the devil love he , so he present sink into the bottom of the sea , and down into hell , where he raise up all the devil to the revenge of his death : and that they bring so great storm and torment upon the Spaniard , because they only maintain the catholic and romish religion . such and the like blasphemy against God , they cease not open to utter , without be reprove of any man therein , nor for their false opinion : but the most part of they rather say and affirm , that of truth it must needs be so . as one of those indian fleet put out of Nova Spagna , there be 35 of they by storm and tempest cast away and drown in the sea , be 50 in all ; so that but 15 escape . of the fleet that come from Santo Domingo there be 14 cast away , come out of the channel of Havana , whereof the admiral and vice - admiral be two of they : and from terra firma in India there come two ship lade with gold and silver , that be take by the Englishman : and before the spanish army come to Corvo , the Englishman at time have take at the least 20 ship , that come from saint Domingo , India , Brasilia , etc and be all send into England . 87
