will not come near we , and when they have well look upon we , they depart . the four day in the morning , sail by the coast , we espy a ledge of rock by the shore , and to the westwards of they two great green hill join together , so that between they it be hollow like a saddle : and within the say rock the master think the aforenamed town have stand , and therefore we man our boat , and take with we cloth , and other merchandise , and row ashore , but go along by the coast , we see that there be no town , therefore we go aboard again . 194 from these two hill aforesaid , about two league to the eastward , lie out into the sea almost two mile a ledge of rock , and beyond that a great bay , which run into the north northwestward , and the land in this place lie north Northeast along the shore : but the uttermost point of land in that place that we can see , lay Northeast , and by east from we . after that we be with a small gale of wind run past that uttermost headland , we see a great red cliff , which the master again judge to be the town of saint Johns , and then we take our boat with merchandise , and go thither , and when we come thither , we perceive that there be a town upon the top of the hill , and so we go towards it , and when we be hard by it , the people of the town come together a great sort of they , and wave we to come in , with a piece of cloth , and so we go into a very fair bay , which lie to the eastward of the cliff , whereupon the town stand , and be within the cliff , we let fall our grapnell , and after that we have tarry there a good space , they send a boat aboard of we , to show we that they have gold , and they show we a piece about half a crown weight , and require to know our measure , and our weight , that they may show their captain thereof : and we give they a measure of two else , and a weight of two angel to show unto he , which they take , and go on shore , and show it unto their captain , and then they bring we a measure of two else , one quarter and a half , and one crusado - weight of gold , make we sign that so much they will give for the like measure , and less they will not have . after this , we tarry there about a hour , and when we see that they will do no otherwise , and withal understand , that all the best place be before we , we depart to our ship and weigh , and run along the shore , and go before with our boat , and have sail about a league , we come to a point where there lay forth a ledge of rock , like to the other before speak of , 195 [ ii two . 30 . ] and be pass that people , the master spy a place which he say plain be the town of don John : and the night be come upon we , so that we can not well discern it , but we anchor as near unto the place as we can . the town of the five day in the morning we perceive it to be don John . same town jn deed , and we man our boat and go thither , and because that the last year the Portugal at that place take away a man from they , and after shot at they with great base , and do beat they from the place , we let fall our grapnel almost a base shot off the shore , and there we lie about two hour , and no boat come to we . then certain of our man with the hind boat go into the bay which lie to the eastward of the town , and within that bay they find a goodly fresh river , and afterward they come and wave to we also to come in , because they perceive the negro to come down to that place , which we do : and immediate the negro come to we , and make we sign that they have gold , but none of they will come aboard our boat , neither can we perceive any boat that they have to come withal , so that we judge that the Portugal have spoil their boat , because we see half of their town destroy . we have stay there a good space , and see that they will not come to we , thrust our boat head a shore , be both well appoint , and then the captain of the town come down be a grave man : and he come with his dart in his hand , and six tall man after he , every one with his dart and his target , and their dart be all of iron , fair and sharp , and there come another after they which carry the captain stool : we salute he , and put off our cap , and bow our self , and he like one that think well of himself , do not move his cap , nor scant bow his body , and sit he down very solemn upon his stool : but all his man put off their cap to we , and bow down themselves . 196 he be clothe from the loin down with a cloth of that country make , wrap about he , and make fast about his loin with a girdle , and his cap of a certain cloth of the country also , and bear legged , and bear footed , and all bare above the loin , except his head . he servant , some of they have cloth about their loin , and some nothing but a cloth betwixt their leg , and make fast before
