, that this purksm ex ~ king have so great quantity of pearl , and do so c ™ ding quan - ordinarily take the same , as that not only his own ’ skin that he wear , and the better sort of his gentleman and follower be full set with the say pearl , but also his bed , and house be garnish with they , and that he have such quantity of they , that it be a wonder to see . he show i that the say king be with he at Chawanook two year before , and bring he certain pearl , but the same of the worst sort , yet be he fain to buy they of he for copper at a dear rate , as he think . he give i a rope of the same pearl , but they be black , and nought , yet many of they be very great , and a few among a number very orient and round , all which i lose with other thing of i , come aboard sir Francis Drake his fleet : yet he tell i that the say king have great store of pearl that be white , great , and round , and that his black pearl his man do take out of shallow water , but the white pearl his man fish for in very deep water . it seem to i by his speech , that the say king have traffic with white man that have clothes as we have , for these white pearl , and that be the reason that he will not depart with other then with black pearl , to those of the same country . 323 a enterprise of speciali importance . the king of Chawanook promise to give i guide to go over land into that king country whensoever i will : but he advise i to take good store of man with i , and good store of victuali , for he say , that king will be loath to suffer any stranger to epter into his country , and especial to meddle with the fish for any pearl there , and that he be able to make a great many of man into the field , which he say will fight very well . hereupon i resolve with my self , that if your supply have come before the end of April , and that you have send any store of boat or man , to have have they make in any reasonable time , with a sufficient number of man and victual to have find we until the new corn be come in , i will have send a small bark . with two pinnace about by sea to the northward to have find out the bay he speak of , and to have sound the bar if there be any , which shall have ride there in the say bay about that hand , while i with all the small boat i can make , and with two hundred man will have go up to the head of the river of Chawanook with the guide that menatonon will have give i , which i will have be assure shall have be of his best man , ( for i have his best belove son prisoner with i ) who also shall have keep i company in a handlocke with the rest , foot by foot , all the voyage over land . my mean be further at the head of the river in the place of my descent where i will have leave my boat , to have raise a sconce with a small trench , and a palisado upon the top of it , in the which , and in the guard of my boat i will have leave five and twenty , or thirty man , with the rest will i have march with as much victuali as every man can have carry , with their furniture , mattock , spade and axe , two day journey . in the end of my march upon some convenient plot will i have raise another sconce accord to the former , where i will have 324 leave fifteen or twenty . and if it will have fall out convenient , in the way i will have raise my say sconce upon some corn field , that my company may have live upon it . and so i will have hold this course of insconse whither m . every two day march , until i have be arrive at the bay or port he speak of : which find to be move 0 worth the possession , i will there have raise a main fort , both for the defence of the harbour , and our ship also , and will have reduce our whole habitation from Roanoak and from the harbour and port there ( which by proof be very nought ) unto this other beforemention , from whence , in the four day march before specify , can i at all time return with my company back unto my boat ride under my sconce , very near whereunto direct from the west run a most notable river , and in all those part most famous , call the river of Moratoc . this river open into the broad sound of weapomeiok . and whereas the river of Chawanook , and all the other sound , and bay , salt and fresh , show no current in the world in calm weather , but be move altogether with the wind : this river of Moratoc have so violent a current from the west and Southwest , that it make i almost of opinion that with oar it will scarce be navigable : it pass with many creek and turn , and for the space of thirty mile row , and more , it be as broad as the Thames betwixt greenwich and the isle of dog , in some place more , and in some less : the current run as strong , be enter so high into the river , as at London bridge upon a vale water . and for that not only Menatonon , but also the savage of Moratoc themselves do report strange thing of the head of that river , and that from Moratoc it self , which be a principali town upon that river , it be thirty day as some of they say , and some say fourty day voyage to the head thereof , which head 325 cmspiracie oj the savage against the english . they say spring out of a main rock in that abundance , that forthwith it make a most violent stream : and further , that this huge rock stand so near unto a sea , that many time in storm ( the wind come outward from the sea ) the wave thereof be beat into
