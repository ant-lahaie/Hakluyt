remnant of Wingina his man , which be leave alive , who dwell at Dasamonquepeuk , be they which have slay George Howe , and be also at the drive of our eleven Englishman from Roanoak , he think to defer the revenge thereof no long . wherefore the same night about midnight , he pass over the water , 395 accompany with captain Stafford , and 24 man , whereof Manteo be one , who we take with we to be our guide to the place where those savage dwell , where he behave himself towards we as a most faithful Englishman . the next day , be the 9 of August , in the morning so early that it be yet dark , we land near the dwell place of our enemy , and very secret convey our self through the wood , to that side , where we have their house between we and the water : and have espy their fire , and some sit about it , we present set on they : the miserable soul herewith amaze , flee into a place of thick reed , grow fast by , where our man perceive they , shoot one of they through the body with a bullet , and therewith we enter the reed , among which we hope to acquit their evil do towards we , but we be deceive , for those savage be our friend , and be come from croatoan to gather the corn and fruit of that place , because they understand our enemy be flee immediate after they have slay George Howe , and for haste have leave all their corn , tobacco , and pompion stand in such sort , that all have be devour of the bird , and deer , if it have not be gather in time : but they have like to have pay dear for it : for it be so dark , that they be naked , and their man and woman apparel all so like other , we know not but that they be all man : and if that one of they which be a wiroances wife have not have a child at her back , she have be slay in stead of a man , and as hap be , another Savage know master Stafford , and run to he , call he by his name , whereby he be save . find our self thus disappoint of our purpose , we gather all the corn , pease , pompion , and tobacco that we find ripe , leave the rest unspoiled , and take menatoan his wife , with the young child , and the other savage with we over the water to Roanoak . 396 the four voyage to Virginia a . d . although the mistake of these savage somewhat grieve Manteo , yet he impute their harm to their own folly , say to they , that if their wiroance have keep their promise in come to the governor at the day appoint , they have not know that mischance . the 13 of August our savage Manteo , by the commandment of sir Walter Ralegh , be christen in Roanoak , and call lord thereof , and of dasamonguepeuk , in reward of his faithful service . the 18 Elinor , daughter to the governor , and wife to Ananias dare one of the assistant , be deliver of a daughter in Roanoak , and the same be christen there the Sunday follow , and because this child be the first christian bear in Virginia , she be name Virginia . by this time our ship have unlade the good and victual of the planter , and begin to take in wood , and fresh water , and to new calk and trim they for England : the planter also prepare their letter and token to send back into England . our two ship , the lion and the flyboat almost ready to depart , the 21 of August , there arise such a tempest at Northeast , that our admiral then ride out of the harbour , be force to cut his cable , and put to sea , where he lie beat off and on six day before he can come to we again , so that we fear he have be cast away , and the rather for that at the time that the storm take they , the most and best of their sailor be leave aland . at this time some controversy arise between the governor and assistant , about choose two out of the twelve assistant , which shall go back as factor for the company into England : for every one of they refuse , save only one , which all other think not sufficient : but at length by much persuade of the governor , Christopher Cooper only agree to go for England : but the next day , through the persuasion of diverse of his familiar friend , he change his mind , so that now the matter stand as at the first . 397 the next day , the 22 of August , the whole company both of the assistant and planter come to the governor , and with one voice request he to return himself into England , for the better and soon obtain of supply , and other necessary for they : but he refuse it , and allege many sufficient cause , why he will not : the one be , that he can not so sudden return back again without his great discredit , leave the action , and so many who he partly have procure through his persuasion , to leave their native country , and undertake that voyage , and that some enemy to he and the action at his return into England will not spare to slander false both he and the action , by say , he go to Virginia , but politic , and to no other end but to lead so many into a country , in which he never mean to stay himself , and there to leave they behind he . theirmeaning also he allege , that see they intend to remove to remove 50 mne far up into the main present , he be country . then absent , his stuff and good may be both spoil , and most of they pilfer away in the carriage , so that at his return he shall be either force to provide himself of all such thing again , or else at his come again to Virginia find himself utter unfurnish , whereof already he have find some proof , be but once from they but three day . wherefore he conclude that he will not go himself . the next day , not only the assistant but diverse other , as well woman as man , begin to renew their request to the governor again , to take upon he to return into England for the supply , and dispatch of all such thing as there be to be do , promise to make he their bond under all their hand
