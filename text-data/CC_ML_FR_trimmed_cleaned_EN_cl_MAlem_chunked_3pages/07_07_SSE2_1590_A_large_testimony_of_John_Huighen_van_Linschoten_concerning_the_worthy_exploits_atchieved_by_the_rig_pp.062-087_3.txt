the manner of their fight , much commend the order and manner of the Englishman fight , as also their courteous use of he : but in the end the english pilot likewise steal away in a french ship , without pay any ransom as yet . in the month of Januarie 1590 there arrive one ship alone in Tercera , that come from the spanish Indies , and bring news that there be a fleet of a hundred ship which put out from the firm land of the spanish Indies , and by a storm be drive upon the coast call Florida , where they be all cast away , she have only escape , wherein there be great riches , and many man lose , as it may well be think : so that they make their account , that of 220 ship that for certain be know to have put out of Nova Spagna , saint Domingo , Havana , Capo verde , Brasilia , Guinea , etc [ ii two . 182 . ] in the year 1589 . to sail for Spain and Portugal , there be not above 14 or 15 of they arrive there in safety , all the rest be either drown , burst or take . in the same month of January there arrive in Tercera 15 or 16 ship that come from Sivil , which be most flyboat of the low country , and some briton that be arrest in Spain : these come full of soldier , and well appoint with munition , to lade the silver that lie in Tercera , and to fetch Alvares de flores by the king commandment into Spain . and because that time of the year there be always storm about those hand , therefore they dare not enter into the road of Tercera , for that as then it blow so great a storm that some of their ship that have anchor be force to cut down their mast , and be in danger to be lose : and among the rest a ship of Biscaie run against the land and be strike in piece , but all the man save themselves . the other ship be force to keep the sea and separate themselves one from the other , where wind and weather will drive they until the 15 of march for that in all that time they can not have one day of fair weather to anchor in , whereby they endure much misery , curse both the silver and the hand . this storm be pass , they chance to meet with a small english ship of about 40 ton in bigness , which by reason of the great wind can not bear all her sail : so they set upon she and take she , and with the english flag in their admiral stern , they come as proud into the haven as if they have conquer all the realm of England : but as the admiral that bear the english flag upon her stern be enter into the road , there come by chance two english ship by the hand that pay she so well for her pain , that they be force to cry misericordia , and without all doubt have take she , if she have be but a mile further in the sea : but because she get under the fortress , which also begin to shoot at the Englishman , they be force to leave she , and to put further into the sea , have slay five or six of the Spaniard . the Englishman that be take in the small ship be put under hatch , and couple in bolt , and after they have be prisoner 3 or 4 day , there be a spanish ensign - bearer in the ship that have a brother slay in the fleet that come for England , who as then mind to revenge his death , and withal to show his manhood on the english captive that be in the english ship , which they have take , as be aforesaid , take a poniard in his hand and go down under the hatch , where find the poor Englishmen sit in bolt , with the same poniard he stab six of they to the heart : which two other of they perceive , clasp each other about the middle , because they will not be murder by he , and throw themselves into the sea and there be drown . this act be of all the Spaniard much dislike and very ill take , so that they carry the Spaniard prisoner unto Lisbon , where be arrive , the king of Spain will he shall be send into England , that the queen of England may use he as she think good : which sentence his friend by intreaty get to be reverse , notwithstanding he command he shall without all favour be behead : but upon a good Friday the Cardinali go to mass , all the captain and commander make so great entreaty for he , that in the end they get his pardon . this i think good to note , that man may understand the bloody and dishonest mind of the Spaniard when they have man under their subjection . the same two english ship which follow the spanish admiral till he have get the fort of Tercera , as i say before , put into the sea , where they meet with another spanish ship be of the same fleet , that have likewise be scatter by the storm and be only miss , for the rest lie in the road . this small ship the Englishman take , and send all the man on shore , not hurt any of they : but if they have know what have be do unto the foresay english captive , i believe they will soon have revenge themselves , as afterward many a innocent soul pay for it . this ship thus take by the Englishman , be the same that be take and confiscate in the hand of Tercera by the Englishman that get out of the hand in a fisher boat ( as t said before ) and be sell unto the Spaniard that as then come from the Indies , wherewith they sail to saint Lucar , where it be also arrest by the duke , and appoint to go in company to fetch the silver in Tercera , because it be a ship that sail well , but among the Spaniard fleet it be the mean of the company . by this mean it be take from the Spaniard and carry into England , and the owner have it again when they least thought of it . the 19 of march the aforesaid ship be 19 in number , set sail , have lade the king silver , and receive in Alvero flores de quiniones , with his company and good provision of necessary , munition and 73 A .
