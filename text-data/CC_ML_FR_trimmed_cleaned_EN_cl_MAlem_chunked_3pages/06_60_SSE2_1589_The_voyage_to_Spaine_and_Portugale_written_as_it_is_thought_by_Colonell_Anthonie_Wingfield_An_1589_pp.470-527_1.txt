already spoil a great part of the provision he have make at the groin of all sort , for a new voyage into England ; burn 3 of his ship , whereof one be the second in the last year expedition call S . Juan de Colorado , take from he above 150 piece of good artillery ; cut off more than 60 hulk and 20 french ship well man fit and 472 ready to serve he for man of war against we , lade for his store with corn , victual , mast , cable and other merchandize ; slay and take the principal man of war he have in galitia ; make don Pedro Enriques de Gusman , Conde de Fuentes , general of his force in Portugal , shameful run at Peniche ; lay along of his best commander in Lisbon ; and by these few adventure discover how easy her majesty may without any great adventure in short time pull the tyrant of the world upon his knee , as well by the disquiet his usurpation of Portugal as without difficulty in keep the commodity of his Indies from he , by send a army so accomplish , as may not be subject to those extremity which we have endure : except he draw , for those defence , his force out of the low country and disfurnish his garrison of Naples and Milan , which with safety of those place he may not do . and yet by this mean he shall rather be enforce thereunto , then by any force that can be use there against he : wherefore i direct conclude that this proceed be the most safe and necessary way to be hold against he , and therefore more import than the war in the low country . yet have the journey ( i know ) be much mislike by some , who either think too worthy of the Spaniard valour , too indifferent of his purpose against we , or too unworthy of they that undertake this journey against he , do think it a thing dangerous to encounter the Spaniard at his own home , a thing ' needless to proceed by invasion against he , a thing of too great moment for two subject of their quality to undertake : and therefore do not so advance the beginning as though they hope for any good success thereof . the chance of war be thing most uncertain : for what people soever undertake they , they be in deed as chastisement appoint by God for the one side or the other . for which purpose it have please he to give some victory to the Spaniard of late year against some who he have in purpose to ruin . but if we con - 473 sider what war they be that have make their name so terrible , we shall find they to have be none other then against the barbarous moor , the naked Indians , and the unarm netherlander , who yield rather to the name then act of the Spaniard , have put they into such a conceit of their mightiness , as they have considerate undertake the conquest of our monarchic , consist of a people unite and always hold sufficient warlike : against who what success their invincible army have the last year , as our very child can witness , so i doubt not but this voyage have sufficient make know what they be even upon their own dunghill , which , have it be set out in such sort as it be agree upon by their first demand , it may have make our nation the most glorious people of the world . for have not the want of 8 of the 12 piece of artillery , which be promise unto the adventure , lose her majesty the possession of the groin and many other place , as hereafter shall appear , who defensible rampire be great than our battery ( such as it be ) can force : and therefore be leave unattempted ? it be also resolve to have send 600 english horse of the low country , whereof we have not one , notwithstanding the great charge expend in their transportation hither : and that may the army assemble at Puente de Burgos thank God of , as well as the force of Portugal , who foreran we 6 day together : do we not want 7 of the 13 old company , which we shall have have from thence ; four of the 10 dutch company ; and 6 of their man of war for the sea , from the Hollander : which i may just say we want , in that we may have have so many good soldier , so many good ship , and so many able body more than we have ? do there not upon the first think of the journey diverse gallant courtier put in their name for adventurer to the sum of 10000 livre . who see it go forward in good earnest , advise themselves better , and lay the want of so much money upon the journey ? 474 be there not moreover a round sum of the adventure spend in levy , furnish , and maintain 3 month 1500 man for the service of Berghen , with which company the mutiny of Ostend be suppress , a service of no small moment ? what misery the detract of the time of our set out , which shall have be the 1 of February , do lay upon we , too many can witness : and what extremity the want of that month victual which we do eat , during the month we lie at Plymouth for a wind , may have drive we unto , no man can doubt of , that know what man do live by , have not God give we in the end a more prosperous wind and short passage into galitia then have be often see , where our own force and fortune revictual we large : of which cross wind , that hold we two day after our go out , the general be weary , thrust to sea in the same , wise choose rather to attend the change thereof there , then by be in harbour to lose any part of the better , when it shall [ ii two . 136 . ] come by have their man on shore : in which two
