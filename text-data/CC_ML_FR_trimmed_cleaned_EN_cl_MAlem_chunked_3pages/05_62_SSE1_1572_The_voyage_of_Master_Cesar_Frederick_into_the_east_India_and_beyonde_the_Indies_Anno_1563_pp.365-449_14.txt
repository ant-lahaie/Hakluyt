[ two » > • 227 ] from Negapatan follow my voyage towards the east a hundred and fifty mile , i find the house of bless saint Thomas , which be a church of great s - 7 ^®^ mrs . devotion , and great regard of the gentile for the great miracle they have hear to have be do by that bless apostle : near unto this church the Portugal have build they a ci tie in the country subject to the king of bezeneger , which city although it be not very great , yet in my judgement it be the fair in all that part of the Indies : and it have very fair house and fair garden in vacant place very well accommodate : it have street large and straight , with many church of great devotion , their house be set close one unto another , with little door , every house have his defence , so that by that mean it be of force sufficient to defend you Portugal against the people of that country . the Portugal there have no other possession but their garden and house that be within the city : the custom belong to the king of bezeneger , which be very small and easy , for that it be a country of great riches five 401 2 c a faint kind of cloth die of diverse colour which those feofle delight much in , and esteem they of great frice . and great trade : there come every year two or three great ship very rich , beside many other small ship : one of the two great ship go for Pegu , and the other for Malacca , lade with fine bombast cloth of every sort , paint , which be a rare thing , because those kind of clothes show as they be gild with diverse colour , and the more they be wash , the lively the colour will show . also there be other cloth of bombast which be weave with diverse colour , and be of great value : also they make in Sant Tome great store of red yarn , which they die with a root call Saia , and this colour will never waste , but the more it be wash , the more red it will show : they lade this yarn the great part of it for Pegu , because that there they work and weave it to make cloth accord to their own fashion , and with lesser charge . it be a marvelous thing to they which have not see the lade and unlade of man and merchandise in saint Tome as they do : it be a place so dangerous , that a man can be serve with small bark , neither can they do their business with the boat of the ship , because they will be beat in a thousand piece , but they make certain bark ( of purpose ) high , which they call masadie , they be make of little board ; one board be sow to another with small cord , and in this order be they make . and - when they be thus make , and the owner will embark any thing in they , either man or good , they lade they on land , and when they be lade , the barkman thrust the boat with her lade into the stream , and with great speed they make haste all that they be able to row out against the huge wave of the sea that be on that shore , until that they carry they to the ship : and in like manner they lade these masady at the ship with merchandise and man . when they come near the shore , the barkman leap out of the bark into the sea to keep the bark right that she cast not thwart the shore , and be keep right , the suff of the sea set her lade dry on land without any hurt or danger , and 402 i5 $ 3 - 81 - sometimes there be some of they that be overthrow , but there can be no great loss , because they lade but a title at a time . all the merchandise they lade outward , they emball it well with ox hide , so that if it take wet , it can have no great harm . in my voyage , return in the year of our lord God one thousand , five hundred , sixty and six , i go from goa unto Malacca , in a ship or Gallion of the king of Portugal , which go unto Banda for to lade in the hand oj nutmeg and mace : from goa to Malacca be one thousand eight hundred mile , we pass without the jor ^ g t £ y hand Zeilan , and go through the channel of Nicubar , grow . or else through the channel of Sombrero , which be by the middle of the hand of Sumatra , call in old time Taprobana : and from Nicubar to Pegu be as it be a row or
