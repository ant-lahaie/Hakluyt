and that other ship also last before mention : which both of they , immediate after the great and better part of their good be unlade , sink right down . for the memory of this exploit , the foresay captain Banderduess cause the banner of one of these ship to be set up in the great church of leiden in holland , which be of so great a length , that be fasten to the very roof , it reach down to the ground . about the same time another small ship be by a small ship necessity drive upon the coast of Flanders , about away Blankenberg , be cast away upon the sand , the people and therein be save . thus almighty God will have the Spaniard huge ship to be present , not only to the view of the english , but also of the zelander ; that at the sight of they they may acknowledge of what small ability they have be to resist such impregnable force , have not God endue they with courage , providence , and fortitude , yea , and fight for they in many place with his own arm . 227 the dishonour - than 29 of July the spanish fleet be encounter able flight of English ( as be aforesaid ) and lie close together under their fight sail , with a southwest wind sail prudent advice past dunkerk , the english ship still follow the chase . of the lord ad - of who the day follow when the Spaniard have get mirall . sea roomej they cut their main sail ;
