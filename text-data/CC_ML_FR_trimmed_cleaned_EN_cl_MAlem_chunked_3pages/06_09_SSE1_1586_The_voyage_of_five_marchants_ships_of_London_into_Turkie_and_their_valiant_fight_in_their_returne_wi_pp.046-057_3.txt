the victory may redound to his name , and to the honour of true religion which the insolent enemy seek so much to overthrow . contrary , the foolish Spaniard cry out accord to their manner , not to God , but to our lady ( as they term the virgin mary ) say , oh lady help , oh bless lady give we the victory , and the honour thereof shall thou . thus with blow and prayer on both side the fight continue furious and sharp , and doubtful a long time to which part the victory will incline : till at the last the admiral of the galley of Sicily begin to warp from the fight , and to hold up her side for fear of sink , and after she go also two other in like case , who all the sort of they enclose , labour by all their mean to keep they above water , be ready by the force of english shot which they have receive to perish in the sea : and what slaughter be do among the Spaniard themselves , the english be uncertain , but by a probable conjecture apparent afar off , they suppose their loss be so great , that they want man to continue the charge of their piece : whereupon with a fight of five shame and dishonour , after 5 . hour spend in the battle , houres - they withdraw themselves : and the english content in respect of their deep lade , rather to continue their voyage then to follow the chase , cease from further blow , with the loss only of two man slay among they all , and another hurt in his arm , who m . Wilkinson with his good word and friendly promise do so comfort , that he nothing esteem the smart of his wound in respect of the honour of the victory , and the shameful repulse of the enemy . thus with dutiful thanks to the mercy of God for his gracious assistance in that danger , the english ship proceed in their navigation , and come as high as Alger , a port town upon the coast of Barbary , they fall 55 with it , of purpose to refresh themselves after their weariness , and to take in such supply of fresh water and victual , as they need : they be no soon enter into the port , but immediate the king thereof send a messenger to the ship to know what they be , with which messenger the chief master of each ship repair to the king , and acquaint he not only with the state of their ship , in respect of merchandise , but with the late fight which they have pass with the spanish galley , report every particular circumstance in word as it fall out in action : whereof the say king show himself marvelous glad , entertain they in the best sort , and promise abundant relief of all their want , make general proclamation in the city upon pain of death , that no man of what degree or state soever he be , shall presume either to hinder they in their affair , or to offer they any manner of injury in body or good . by virtue whereof they dispatch all thing in excellent good sort , with all favour and peaceableness : only such prisoner and captive of the Spaniard as be in the city , see the good usage which they receive , and hear also what service they have perform against the foresay galley , grudge exceed against they , and seek as much as they can to practise some mischief against they : and one among the rest see a Englishman alone in a certain lane of the city , come upon he sudden , and with his knife thrust he in the side , yet make no such great wound , but that it be easy recover . the english company hear of it , acquaint the king with the fact , who immediate send both for the party that have receive the wound , and the offender also , and cause a executioner in the presence of himself and the english , to chastise the slave even to death , which be perform to the end that no man shall presume to commit the like part , or to do any thing in contempt of his royal commandment . the english have receive this good justice at the king hand , and all other thing that they want , or 56 can crave for the furnish of their ship , take their leave of he , and of the rest of their friend , that be resident in Alger , and put out to sea , look to meet with the second army of the spanish king , which wait for they about the mouth of the strait of Gibraltar , which they be of necessity to pass . but come near to the say strait , it please God to raise at that instant a very dark and misty fog , so that one ship can not discern another , if it be 40 . pace off : by mean whereof , together with the notable fair eastern wind that then blow most fit for their course , they pass with great speed through the strait , and may have pass with that good gale , have there be 500 galley to withstand they , and the air never so clear for every ship to be see . but yet the spanish the second galley have a sight of they when they be come within 3 . English mile of the town , and make after they in all possible haste , and although they see that they be English . far out of their reach , yet in a vain fury and foolish pride , they shoot off their ordinance , and make a stir in the sea as if they have be in the midst of they , which vanity of they minister to our man notable matter of pleasure and mirth , see man to fight with shadow , and to take so great pain to so small purpose . but thus it please God to deride , and delude all the force of that proud spanish king , which he have provide of purpose to distress the english , who notwithstanding pass through both his army , in the one , little hurt , and in the other nothing touch , ' to the glory of he immortali name , the honour of our prince and country , and the just commendation of each man service perform in that voyage .
