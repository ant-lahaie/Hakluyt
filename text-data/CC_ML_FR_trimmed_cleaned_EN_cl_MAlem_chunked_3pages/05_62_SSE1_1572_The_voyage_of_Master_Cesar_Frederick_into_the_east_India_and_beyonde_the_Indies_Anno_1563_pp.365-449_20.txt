, accord it to the estate of the person that be slay , but these 415 Falchines be the servant of the king , the retor dare not do any thing in the matter , without the consent of the king , because it be necessary that the king shall know of such a matter . when the king have knowledge thereof , he give commandment that the malefactor shall be keep until his come home , and then he will due minister justice , but the captain of the Portugal will not deliver those man , but rather set himself with all the rest in arm , and go every day through the city march with his drum and ensign display . for at that time the city be empty of man , by reason they be go all to the war and in business of the king : in the midst of this rumour we come thither , and i think great pride of it a strange thing to see the Portugal use such in - the Portugal . soiencie ; in another man city . and i stand in doubt of that which come to pass , and will not unlade my good because that they be more sure in the ship then on the land , the great part of the lade be the owner of the ship , who be in Malacca , yet there be diverse merchant there , but their good be off small importance , all those merchant tell i that they will not unlade any of their good there , unless i will unlade first , yet after they leave my counsel and follow their own , and put their good a land and lose every whit . the rector with the customer send for i , and demand why i put not my good a land , and pay my custom as other man do ? to who i answer , that i be a merchant that be new come thither , and see such disorder among the Portugal , i doubt the loss of my good which cost i very dear , with the sweat of my face , and for this cause i [ ii i . 233 . ] be determine not to put my good on land , until such time as his honour will assure i in the name of the king , that i shall have no loss , and although there come harm to the Portugal , that neither i nor my good shall have any hurt , because i have neither part nor any difference with they in this tumult : my 416 reason sound well in the retors ear , and so present he send for the bargit , which be as counseller of the city , and there they promise i on the king head or in the behalf of the king , that neither i nor my good shall have any harm , but that we shall be safe and sure : of which promise there be make public note . and then i send for my good and have they on land , and pay my custom , which be in that country ten in the hundred of the same good , and for my more security i take a house right against the retors house . the captain of the Portugal , and all the Portugal merchant be put out of the city , and i with twenty and two poor man which be officer in the ship , have my dwell in the city . after this , the gentile devise to be revenge of the Portugal ; but they will not put it in execution until such time as our small ship have discharge all her good , and then the next night follow come from Pegu four thousand soldier with some elephant of war ; and remp ° ” before that they make any tumult in the city , the tkeportusf > les - retor send , and give commandment to all Portugal that be in the city , when they hear any rumour or noise , that for any thing they shall not go out of their house , as they tender their own health . than four hour within night i hear a great rumour and noise of man of war , with elephant which throw down the door of the warehouse of the Portugal , and their house of wood and straw , in the which tumult there be some Portugal wound , and one of they slay ; and other without make proof of their manhood , which the day before do so brag , at that time put themselves to flight most shameful , and save themselves a board of little ship , that be at a anchor in the harbour , and some that be in their bed flee away naked , and that night they carry away all the Portugal good out of the suburb into the city , and those Portugal that have their good in the suburb also . after this the Portugal that be five 417 2d flee into the ship to save themselves , take a new courage to themselves , and come on land and set fire on the house in the suburb , which house be make of board and straw , and the wind blow fresh , in small time be burn and consume , with which fire half the city have like to have be burn ; when the Portugal have do this , they be without all hope to recover any part of their good again , which good may amount to the sum of sixteen thousand ducat , which , if they have not set fire to the town , they may have have again without any loss at all . then the Portugal understand that this thing be not do by the consent of the king , but by his lieutenant and the retor of the city be very ill content , know that they have make a great fault , yet the next morning follow , the Portugal begin to bend and shoot their ordinance against the ci tie , which battery of they continue four day , but all be in vain , for the shot never hit the city , but light on the top of a small hill near unto it , so that the city
