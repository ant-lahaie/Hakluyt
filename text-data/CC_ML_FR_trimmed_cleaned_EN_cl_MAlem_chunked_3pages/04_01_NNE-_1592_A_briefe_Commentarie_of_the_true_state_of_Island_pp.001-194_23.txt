island now occupy by they for the space of 60 . year or thereabouts : but they remain ethnic almost a 100 year , except a very few which be baptise in Norwaie . but scarce a 100 year from their first entrance be pass , present Christian religion begin to be consider Fridericus upon , namely about the year of our lord 974 . which Saxo the first thing above 20 . year together , be diverse attempt preacher of the of many not without notable rebellion : among the rest be mention two outlandish bishop , who anno domini with other diligent labour in convert the hand 981 . to Christian faith : the former be one Fridericus a 150 saxon bear , who in the year 981 . come into island , and behave himself courageous in the office of preach , and prevail so much , that in the year 984 . Churches be use in island . but the other outlandish bishop or preacher who they call Thangbrandt come first into island in the year 997 . and then after 26 . year consult about religion , - anno domini at length in the year 1000 it be decree in a general I000 â€˜ assembly of all the inhabitant by their whole consent , that the worship of heathenish idol be abandon , they shall embrace Christian religion . again , in the year 1050 . it be decree in a solemn assembly of the inhabitant , that temporali or politic law ( the constitution whereof be bring out of Norwaie be communicate unto the islander by one ulfliot in the year 926 . ) shall every where give place to the canon or divine law . in the year 1056 . one Isleif go beyond the sea out of island to be consecrate bishop of island . he come home consecrate into island , and enter into the bishopric of Schalholt in the year 1057 . he die 1080 . in the year of his age 74 . the 4 . of the kalend of July . these thing perhaps will seem trifle , short and base , nor sufficient worthy to be mention , together with many other matter which follow : but neither do we compile the roman history , neither yet shall these thing be so trifle , but that they may be of sufficient force to convince the error of Krantzius and other , accord to our purpose . and undoubted as touch the truth of our history , it be evident that saxon Grammaticus attribute very much unto they : who word in his preface of Denmark be these : neither be the notable tes - diligence of the Thylenses ( for so he call islander ) fimmuofSaxo to be smother in silence : who when as by reason * e of the native barrenness of their soil , want nourishment of riot , they do exercise the duty of continual 151 sobriety , and use to bestow all the time of their life in the knowledge of other man exploit , they supply their want by their wit . for they esteem it a pleasure to know , and commit unto memory the famous act of other nation , reckon it no less praiseworthy to discourse of other man virtue , than to practise their own . who treasury replenish with the monument of historical matter , i more curious search into , have compile no small part of this present work by follow of their relation : neither despise i to have those man for my judge , who i know to be skilful in so great knowledge of antiquity . thus far Saxo . wherefore i think it not amiss to proceed in the recital of the bishop of island , that the order and descent of they all , be so far forth as be possible , diligent put together out of our yearly record , may make good that which we have allege against Krantzius concern Isleif the first bishop of island . in the year of Christ . the bishop of Schalholt . the bishop of holen . in the year of Christ . 1056 .
