and say further , that they be heretic : and therefore they say it be convenient they shall not be suffer so to depart , without be examine , and punish as enemy , to the example of other . the captain be a friend unto the english man , by reason that one of they which have be there before , have give he certain present , will not be persuade to trouble they , but ship they with all their ware in a ship that be to sail for goa , and send they to the viceroy , that he may examine and try they , as he think good : where when they be arrive , they be cast into prison , and first examine whether they be good Christians or no : and because they can speak but bid Portugal , only two of they speak good dutch , as have be certain year in the low country , and there traffic , there be a dutch Jesuite bear in the town of Bruges in Flanders , that have be resident in the Indies for the space of thirty year , send unto they , to undermine and examine they : wherein they behave themselves so well , that they be hold and esteem for good and catholic Christians : yet still suspect , because they be stranger , and special english man . the Jesuit still tell they that they shall be send prisoner into Portugal , wish they to leave off their trade of maj - chandise , and to become Jesuit , promise they thereby to defend they from all trouble . the cause why they say so , and persuade they in that earnest manner , be , for that the dutch Jesuite have secret 5 ° 7 be advertise of great sum of money which they have about they , and seek to get the same into their finger , for that the first vow and promise they make at their entrance into their order , be , to procure the welfare of their say order , by what mean soever it be . but although the english man deny they , and refuse the order , say , that they be unfit for such place , nevertheless they proceed so far , that one of they , be a painter ( that come with the other three for company , to see the country , and to seek his fortune , and be not send thither by the english merchant ) partly for fear , and partly for want of mean to relieve himself , promise they to become a Jesuite : and although they know and well perceive he be not any of those that have the treasure , yet because he be a painter , whereof there be but few in India , and that they have great need of he to paint their church , which otherwise will cost they great charge , to bring one from portugal , they be very glad thereof , hope in time to get the rest of they with all their money into their fellowship : so that to conclude , they make this painter a Jesuite , . where he continue certain day , give he good store of work to do , and entertain he with all the favour and friendship they can devise , and all to win the rest , to be a prey for they : but the other three continue still in prison , be in great fear , because they understand no man that come to they , nor any man almost know what they say : till in the end it be tell they that certain dutch man dwell in the archbishop house , and counsel give they to send unto they , whereat they much rejoice , and send to i and a other dutch man , desire we once to come and speak with they , which we present do , and they with tear in their eye make complaint unto we of their hard usage , show we from point to point ( as it be say before ) why [ ii i . 267 . ] they be come into the country , withal desire we for God cause , if we may by any mean , to help they , that they may be set at liberty upon surety , 508 be ready to endure what justice shall ordain for they , say , that if it be find contrary , and that they be other then travel merchant , and seek to find out
