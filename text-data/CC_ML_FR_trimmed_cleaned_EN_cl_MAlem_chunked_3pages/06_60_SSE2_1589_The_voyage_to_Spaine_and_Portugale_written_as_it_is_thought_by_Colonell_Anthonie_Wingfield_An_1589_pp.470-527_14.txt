as saint Julian : which news be so welcome to the earl of Essex and the general , as they offer every one of they to give the messenger a hundred crown if they find they in the place ; for the general desire nothing more than to fight with they in field room , dispatch that night a messenger with a trumpet , by who he write a cartel to the general of their army , wherein he give they the lie , in that it be by they report that we dislodge from Lisbon in disorder and fear of they ( which indeed be most false ) for that it be five of the clock in the morning before we fall into arm , and then go in such sort , as they have no courage to follow out upon we . also he challenge he therein , to meet he the next morning with his whole army , if he dare attend his come , and there to try out the justness of their quarrel by battle : by who also the earl of Essex ( who prefer the honour of the cause , which be his country , before his own safety ) send a particular cartel , offer himself against any of they , if they have any of his quality ; or if they will not 508 the Portugal voyage admit of that ; six , eight , or ten , or as many as they will appoint , shall meet so many of they in the head of our battle to try their fortune with they ; and that they shall have assurance of their return and honourable entreaty . the general accord make all his army ready by three of the clock in the morning and march even to the place where they have encamp , but they be dislodge in the night in great disorder , be take with a sudden fear that we have be come upon they , as the general be the next day certain inform : so as the trumpet follow they to Lisbon , but can not get other answer to either of his letter , but threaten to be hang , for dare to bring such a message . howbeit the general have cause to be write upon the backside of their passport , that if they do offer any violence unto the messenger , he will hang the best prisoner he have of they : which make they to advise better of the matter , and to return they home ; but without answer . after our army come to Cascais , and the castle summon , the Castellan thereof grant , that upon five or six shot of the canon he will deliver the same , but not without sight thereof . the general think that his distress within have be such for want of man or victual as he can not hold it many day , because he see it otherwise defensible enough , determine rather to make he yield to that necessity , than to bring the cannon , and therefore only set a guard upon the same , lest any supply of those thing which he want shall be bring unto they . but he still stand upon those condition , the general about two day before he determine to go to sea , bring three or four piece of battery against it : upon the first tire whereof he surrender , and compound to go away with his baggage and army ; he have one canon , two culvering , one basilisk , and three or four other field piece , threescore and five soldier , very good store of munition , 5 Â° 9 and victual enough in the castle ; insomuch as he may have hold the same long than the general have in purpose to tarry there . one company of footman be put into the guard thereof , till the artillery be take out , and our army embark ; which without have that fort , we can not without great peril have do . when we be ready to set sail ( one half of the fort be by order from the general blow up by i ) the company be draw away . during the time we lie in the road , our fleet begin the second of June , and so continue six day after to fetch in some hulk to the number of threescore , of dansik , Stetin , Rostock , Lubeck and Hamburgh , lade with spanish good , and as it seem for the king provision , and go for Lisbon : their principali lade be corn , mast , cable , copper , and wax : among which be some of great burden wonder well bud for sail , which have no great lade in they , and therefore it be think that they be bring for the king provision , to reinforce his decay navy : whereof there be the great likelihood , in that the owner of the great of they which carry two misnes , be know to be very inward with the Cardinali , who rather than he will be take with his ship , commit himself unto his small boat , wherein he recover saint Sebastian : into the which our man , that before be in flyboat , be ship , and the flyboat send home with a offer of corn , to the value of their hire . but the wind be good for they for rochel , they choose rather to lose their corn then the wind , and so depart . the general also send his horse with they , and from thence ship they into England . the three of June , colonel Devereux and colonel Sidney , be both very sick , depart for England , who in the whole journey have show themselves very forward to all service , and in their departure very unwilling to leave we : that day we embark all our army , but lie in the road until the eight thereof . 510 the sixth day the earl of Essex , upon receit of letter from her majesty , by they that bring in the victual , present depart towards England , with who sir Roger William be very desirous to go , but find the general very unwilling he shall do so , in that he bear the next place unto they
