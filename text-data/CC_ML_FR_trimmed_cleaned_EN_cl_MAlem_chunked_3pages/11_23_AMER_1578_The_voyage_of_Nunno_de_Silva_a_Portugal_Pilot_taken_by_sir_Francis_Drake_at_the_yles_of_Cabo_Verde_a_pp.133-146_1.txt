and although you find some crooking , yet they be nothing to speak of . the issue of the straight lie westward , and about eight or ten league before you come to the end , than the straight begin to be broad , and it be all high land to the end thereof , after you be eight league within the strait , for the first eight league after you enter be low flat land , as i say before : and in the entry of the strait you find the stream to run from the south sea to the north sea . and after they begin to sail in with the eastnortheast wind , be enter they pass along without any let or hindrance either of wind or weather : and because the high land on both side lay cover with snow , and that all the strait be fair and clear , they hold their course a harquebus - shot in length from off the north side , have nine and ten fathom depth , with good ground , as i say before , where ( if need require ) a man may anchor : the hill on both side be full of tree , some of the hill and tree reach down to the sea - side in some place have plain and even land : and there they see not any great river , but some small river that issue out of the rifle and breach of the land : and in the country where the great cape or crooking be , on the south side they see certain indian fisherman in their canoas or skiffs , be such as they see first on the north side , but more people they see not on the south side . be out of the strait on the other side , upon the sixth of September of the aforesaid year , they hold their course northwest for the space of three day , and the three day they have a north - east wind , that by force drive they westsouthwest , which course they hold for 136 the space of ten or twelve day with few sail up : and because the wind begin to be very great , they take in all their sail , and lay drive till the last of September . the 24 day of the same month have lose the sight of this be the one of their ship which be about a hundred ton , then again they hoist sail because the wind come winter better , hold their course Northeast for the space of seven day , and at the end of the say seven day , they have the sight of certain island , which they make towards for to anchor by they , but the weather will not permit they : and be there , the wind fall northwest : whereupon they sail Westsouthwest . the next day they lose the sight of another ship of their company , for it be very foul weather , so that in the end the admiral ship be leave alone , for the ship of Nuno da Silva be leave in the bay where they winter before they enter into the strait : and with this foul weather they run till they be under seven and they be fifty degree , where they enter into a haven of a drivenunt0 island , and anchor about the length of the shot of a great piece from the land , at twenty fathom deep , latitude . where they stay three or four day , and the wind come southward , they weigh anchor , hold their course northward for the space of two day , and then they espy a small unhabit island , where be arrive , they strike sail , and hoist out their boat , and there they take many bird and seal . the next day they set sail again , hold their course Northnortheast , and north , to another island lie five the isle of or six league from the firm land , on the north side Mocha in 38 . of the strait , where they anchor about a quarter 3 °‘ mm ' of a league from the land , in twelve fathom water . this island be small and low land , and full of Indians , the island be altogether possess and inhabit by they , where they hoist out their boat , wherein the admiral and twelve Englishman enter , go to fetch fresh water , and to seek for victual : and be land upon the island , the Indians in exchange of other thing , 137 bring two spanish sheep , and a little Maiz or root whereof they make bread , and because it be late , they return again unto their ship , without do any other thing for that day . the next day the say captain with the aforesaid twelve man be harquebusier , row to land again , and set two of their company on shore with their vessel to fetch fresh water , and by the place where they shall fill their water there lay certain Indians secret hide , that fall upon the two Englishman and take they : which they in the boat perceive , go out to help they , but they be so assail with stone and arrow , that all or sir Frandt the most part of they be hurt , the captain himself be wound with a arrow on the face , and with a w u ' other arrow in the head , whereby they be constrain to turn back again , without once hurt any of the Indians , and yet they come so near the boat , that they take four of their oar from they . this do , they set sail again , run along the coast with a south wind , sail so for the space of six day , pass by the haven call Sant Iago , and put into another haven , and there they take a indian that lie fish in a Canoa , give he linen and butcher chap knife , with other trifle , and not long after there come another indian aboard their ship call Felippe , and he speak Spanish , he give the english captain notice of a certain ship that lie in the haven of Sant Iago , which they have leave six league behind they : with that intelligence the indian be their guide , the next day they set sail and go to the aforesaid haven of saint Iago , and enter therein , they take the say ship ,
