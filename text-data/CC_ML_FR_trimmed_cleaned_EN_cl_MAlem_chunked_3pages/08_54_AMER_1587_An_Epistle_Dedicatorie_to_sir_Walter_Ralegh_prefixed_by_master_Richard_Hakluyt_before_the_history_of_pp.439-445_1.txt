Columbus record in the history of the deed of his father ) she lay part of her own jewel , which she have in great account , to gage , to furnish his father forth upon his first voyage , before any foot of land of all the west Indies be discover ; what may we expect of our most magnificent and gracious prince Elizabeth of England , into who lap the lord have most plentiful throw his treasure , what may we , i say , hope of she forward - 442 nes and bounty in advance of this your most honourable enterprise , be far more certain than that of Columbus , at that time especial , and tend no less to the glory of God then that action of the Spaniard ? for as you may read in the very last word of the relation of new Mexico extant now in english , the main land , where your last colony mean to seat themselves , be replenish with many thousand of Indians , which be of better wit than those of Mexico and theaptnesse Peru , as have be find by those that have have some trial ! or they : whereby it may be gather that they ofVirgmiato will easy embrace the gospel , forsake their idolatry , embrace wherein at this present for the most part they be wrap christiamtie . and entangle . a wise philosopher note the sundry Seneca . desire of diverse man , write , that if a ox be put into a meadow he will seek to fill his belly with grass , if a stork be cast in she will seek for snake , if you turn in a hound he will seek to start a hare : so sundry man enter into these discovery propose unto themselves several end . some seek authority and place of commandment , other experience by see of the world , the most part worldly and transitory gain , and that often time by dishonest and unlawful mean , the few number the glory of God and the save of the soul of the poor and blind infidel . yet because diverse honest and well dispose person be enter already into this your business , and that i know you mean hereafter to send some such good churchman thither , as may true say with the apostle to the savage , we z . Cor . 12 . 14 . seek not you but you : i conceive great comfort of the success of this your action , hope that the lord , who power be wont to be perfect in weakness , will bless the feeble foundation of your build . only be you Josue 1 . 6 . of a valiant courage and faint not , as the lord say unto Josue , exhort he to proceed on forward in the conquest of the land of promise , and remember that private man have happy wield and wade through as great enterprise as this , with lesser mean than those which 443 god in his mercy have bountiful bestow upon you , to the singular good , as i assure my self , of this our common wealth wherein you live . hereof we have the god sue - example domestical and foreign . Remember i pray c * ssej y ° u > what you find in the begin of the chronicle stra ^ ow rd the conquest of Ireland new dedicate unto your earleofchep - self . read you not that Richard Strangbow the decay stow . earl of Chepstow in Monmuthshire , be in no great favour of his sovereign , pass over into that island in the year 1171 . and accompany only with certain of his private friend have in short space such prosperous success , that he open the way for king Henry the second to the speedy subjection of all that warlike nation to this crown of England ? the like conquest of Brasilia , and annex the same to the kingdom of Portugal be first begin by mean and private man , as don Antonio de Castillio , ambassador here for that realm , and by office keeper of all the record and monument of their discovery , assure i in this city in the year 1581 . now if the greatness of the main of Virginia , and the large extension thereof , especial to the west , shall make you think that the subdue of it , be a matter of more difficulty than the conquest of Ireland , first i answer , that as the late experience of that skilful ! the happy late pilot and captain m . John Davis to the northwest discoverieto ( towards which his discovery your self have thrice Captaine ^ contribute with the forward ) have show a great part Davis . to be main sea , where before be think to be main land , so for my part i be full persuade by Ortelius late reformation of culvacan and the gulf of California , that the land on the back part of Virginia extend nothing so far westward as be put down in the map of those part . Moreover it be not to be deny , but that one hundred man will do more now among the naked and unarm people in Virginia , than one thousand be able then to do in Ireland against that arm and warlike nation in those day . i say further , that these two year last experience have plain show , that we may spare 444 10000 able man without any miss . and these be as many as the kingdom of Portugal have ever in all their garrison of the azore , Madera , Arguin , Cape verde , Guinea , Brasill , Mozambique , melinde , Zocotora , ormus , diu , goa , Malaca , the Malucos , and Macao upon the coast of China . yea this i say by the confession of singular expert man of their own nation ( who name i suppress for certain cause ) which have be personal in the east Indies , and have assure i that their king the hinge of have never above ten thousand natural bear Portugal ( their slave except ) out of their kingdom remain ten thousand of in all the aforesaid territory . which also this present their natural year i see confirm in a secret extract of the particular subject in all estate of that kingdom and of every government and office subject to the same , with the several pension there - ^ ons ' unto belong . see therefore we be so far from want of people , that retire daily home out of the low country they go idle up and down in swarm for lack of honest entertainment , i see no fit place to employ some part of the better sort of they train up thus long in service , then in the inward part of the firm of Virginia against such stubborn savage as shall refuse obedience to her majesty . and doubtless many of our man will be glad and fain to accept this condition , when as by the read of this present treaty they shall understand the fertility and riches of the region confine so near upon you , the great commodity and goodness whereof you have be content to suffer to come to light . in the mean season i humble commend my self and this my translation unto you , and your self , and all those which under you have take this enterprise in hand to the grace and good blessing of the almighty , which be able to build far , and to finish the good work which in these our day he have begin by your most christian and charitable endeavour . from London the 1 . of May 1587 . your lord humble at commandment .
