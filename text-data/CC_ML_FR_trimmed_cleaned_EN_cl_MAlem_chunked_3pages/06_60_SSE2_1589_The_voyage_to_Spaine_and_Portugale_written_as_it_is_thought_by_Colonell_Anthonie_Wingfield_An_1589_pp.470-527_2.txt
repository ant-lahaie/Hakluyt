day 25 of our company ship in part of the fleet be scatter from we , either not be able or willing to double Ushant . these burden lay upon our general before their go out , they have patient endure , and i think they have thereby much enlarge their honour : for have do thus ' much with the want of our artillery , 600 horse , 3000 foot , 20000 livre . of their adventure , and one month victual of their proportion , what may be conjecture they will have do with their full compliment ? for the loss of our man at sea , since we can lay it on none but the will of God , what can be say more , than that it be his pleasure to turn all those impediment to the honour of they against who they be intend : and he will still show himself the lord of host in do great thing by they , who many have seek to obscure : who if they have let the action fall at the height thereof in respect of those defect , which be such 475 especial for the service at land , as will have make a mighty subject stoop under they , i do not see how any man can just have lay any reproach upon he who command the same , but rather have lament the iniquity of this time , wherein man who foreign country have for their conduct in service worthy esteem of , shall not only in their own country not be second in their honourable endeavour , but mighty hinder , even to the impair of their own estate , which most willing they have adventure for the good of their country : who ' worth i will not value by my report , lest i shall seem guilty of flattery ( which my soul abhor ) and yet come short in the true measure of their praise . only for your instruction against they who have almost seduce you from the true opinion you hold of such man , you shall understand that general Norris from his book be train up in the war of the admiral of France , and in very young year have charge of man under the earl of Essex in Ireland : which with what commendation he then discharge , i leave to the report of they who observe those service . upon the breach betwixt don John and the state , he be make colonel general of all you english force there present , or to come , which he continue 2 year : he be then make martial of the field under Conte Hohenlo : and after that , general of the army in Frisland : at his coming home in the time of monsieurs government in Flanders , he be make lord precedent of Munster in Ireland , which he yet hold , from whence within one year he be send for , and send general of the english force which her majesty then lend to the low country , which he hold till the earl of leicester go over . and he be make martial of the field in England , the enemy be upon our coast , and when it be expect the crown of England shall have be try by battle . all which place of commandment which never any Englishman successive attain unto in foreign war , and the high place her majesty have think he 476 the Portugal voyage worthy of , may suffice to persuade you , that he be not altogether unlikely to discharge that which he undertook . what fame general drake have get by his journey about the world , by his adventure to the west Indies , and the scourge he have lay upon the spanish nation , i leave to the southern part to speak of , and refer you to the book extant in our own language treat of you same , and beseech you consider the weighty matter they have in all the course of their life with wonderful reputation manage , that you will esteem they not well inform of their proceed , that think they insufficient to pass through that which they undertake , especial have go thus far in the view of the world , through so many encumbrance , and disappoint of those agreement which lead they the rather to undertake the service . but it may be you will think i herein either to much opinionate of the voyage , or conceit of the commander , y â€˜ labour thus earnest to advance the opinion of they both , have not so much as touch any part of the misorder , weakness and want that have be among we , whereof they that return do plentiful report . true it be , i have conceive a great opinion of the journey , and do think honorable of the commander : for we find in great antiquity , that many commander have be receive home with triumph for less merit , and that our own country have honour man heretofore with admiration for adventure unequal to this : it may therefore in those day have seem superfluous to extend any man commendation by particular remembrance , for that then all man be ready to give every man his due . but i hold it most necessary in these day , sithence every virtue find her direct opposite , and action worthy of all memory be in danger to be envious obscure , to denounce the praise of the action , and actor to the full , but yet no further than with sincerity of truth , and not without grieve at the injury of this time , wherein be enforce 477 a necessity of apology for those man and matter , which all former time be accustom to entertain with the great applause that may be . but to answer the report which have be give out in reproach of the actor and action by such as be in the same : let no man think otherwise , but that they , who fear the casuali accident of war have any purpose of return , do first advise of some occasion that shall move they [ ii two . 137 . ] thereunto : and have find any whatsoever do think it sufficient just , in respect of the earnest desire they have to seek out matter that may colour their
