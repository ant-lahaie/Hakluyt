and the feast of the ascension of our lord , we coast over to a land and shallow of low sand , which be about eight league southwest from brion island , above which be large champain , full of tree and also a enclose sea , whereas we can neither see , nor perceive any gap or way to enter thereinto . on Friday follow , be the 27 of the month , because the wind do change on the coast , we come to brion island again , where we stay till the begin of June , and towards the southeast of this island , we see a land , seem unto we as a island , we coast it about two league and a half , and by the way we have notice of three other high island , lie towards the sand : after we have know these thing we return to the cape of the say land , which do divide it self into two or three very high cape : the water there be very deep , and the flood of the sea run so swift , that it can possible be swift . that day we come to cape loreine , which be in forty seven degree and a half towards the south : on which cape there be a low land , and it seem that there be some entrance of a river , but there be no haven of any worth . 259 above these land we see another cape towards the south , we name it saint Paul cape , it be at 47 degree and a quarter . the Sunday follow , be the four of June , and Whitsonday , we have notice of the coast lie eastsoutheast , distant from the Newfoundland about two and twenty league : and because the wind be against we , we go to a haven , which we name saint spiritus porte , where we stay till Tewesday that we depart thence , sail along that coast until ! we come to saint Peter island . we find along the say coast many very dangerous island and shelf , which lie all in the way eastsoutheast and westnorthwest , about three and twenty league into the sea . while we be in the say saint Peter island we meet with many ship of France and of Britain , we stay there from saint Barnabas day , be the eleven of the month , until the sixteenth that we depart thence and come to cape raze , and enter into a port call Rognoso , where we take in fresh water , and wood to pass the sea : there we leave one of our boat . then upon Monday , be the nineteenth of June , we go from that port , and with such good and prosperous weather we sail along the sea , in such sort , that upon the sixth of July 1536 we come to the porte of saint Malo , by the grace of God , to who we pray , here end our navigation , that of his infinite mercy he will grant we his grace and favour , and in the end bring we to the place of everlasting felicity . amen . here follow the language of the country , and kingdom of Hochelaga and Canada , of we call new France : but first the name of their number .
