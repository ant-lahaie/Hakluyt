the say fresh stream , so that the fresh water for a certain space , grow salt and brackish : i take a resolution with my self , have dismiss Menatonon upon a ransom agree for , and send his son into the pinnace to Roanoak , to enter present so far into that river with two double whirry , and fourty person one or other , as i can have victuali to carry we , until we can meet with more either of the moratok , or of the mangoak , which be another kind of savage , dwell more to the westward of the say river : but the hope of recover moor victuali from the savage make i and my company as narrow to escape starve in that discovery before our return , as ever man do , that miss the same .. for Pemisapan , who have change his name of win - gina upon the death of his brother Granganimo , have give both the choanist , and mangoak word of my purpose touch they , i have be enforce to make he privy to the same , to be serve by he of a guide to the mangoak , and yet he do never rest to solicit continual my go upon they , certify i of a generail assembly even at that time make by Menatonon at Chawanook of all his weroance , and ally to the number of three thousand bow , prepare to come upon we at Roanoak , and that the mangoak also be join in the same confederacy , who be able of themselves to bring as many more to the enterprise : and true it be that at that time the assembly be hold at Chawanook about we , as i find at my come thither , which be unlooked for do so dismay they , as it make we have the better hand at they . but this confederacy against we of the choanist and Mangoaks be altogether and whole procure by Pemisapan him - 326 self , as Menatonon confess unto i , who send they continual word , that our purpose be full bend to destroy they : on the other side he tell i , that they have the like meaning towards we . he in like sort have send word to the mangoak of my intention to pass up into their river , and to kill they ( as he say ) both they and the moratok , with who before we be enter into a league , and they have ever deal kind with we , abandon their town along the river , and retire themselves with their * crenepos , and their corn within the main : * then - insomuch as have pass three day voyage up the women ‘ river , we can not meet a man , nor find a grain of corn in any their town : whereupon consider with my self that we have but two day victuali leave , and that we be then 160 . mile from home , beside casualty of contrary wind or storm , and suspect treason of our own Savages in the discovery of our voyage intend , though we have no intention to be hurtful to any of they , otherwise then for our copper to have have corn of they : i at night upon the corpse of guard , before the put forth of centinel , advertise the whole company of the case we stand in for victuali , and of my opinion that we be betray by our own Savages , and of purpose draw forth by they upon vain hope to be in the end starve , see all the country flee before we , and therefore while we have those two day victuali leave , 1 thought it good for we to make our ■ return homeward , and that it be necessary for we to get the other side of the sound of weopomeiok in time , where we may be relieve upon the wear of Chypanum , and the woman town , although the people be flee . thus much i signify unto they , as the safe way : nevertheless i do refer it to the great number of voice , whether we shall adventure the spend of our whole victuali in some further view of that most goodly river in hope to meet with some better hap , 327 a marvellous mineral in the country of Chaunls Temoatan . or otherwise to retire our self back again . and for that they may be the better advise , i will they to deliberate all night upon the matter , and in the morning at our go aboard to set our course accord to the desire of the great part . their resolution full and whole be ( and not three find to be of the contrary opinion ) that while there be leave but one half pint of corn for a man , we shall not leave the search of that river , and that there be in the company two mastiff , upon the pottage of which with sassafras leave ( if the worst fell out ) the company will make shift to live two day , which time will bring they down the current to the mouth of the river , and to the entry of the sound , and in two day more at the far they hope to cross the sound and to be relieve by the wear , which two day they will fast rather than be draw back a foot till they have see the mangoaks , either as friend or foe . this resolution of they do not a little please i , since it come of themselves , although for mistrust of that which afterward do happen , i pretend to have be rather of the contrary opinion . and that which make i most desirous to have some do with the mangoak either in friendship or otherwise to have have one or two of they prisoner , be , for that it be a thing most notorious to all the country , that there be a province to the which the say mangoak have recourse and traffic up that river of Moratoc , which have a marvelous and most strange Minerali . this mine be so notorious among they , as not only to the savage dwell up the say river , and also to the savage of Chawanook , and all they to the westward , but also to all they of the main : the country name be of fame , and be call Chaunis Temoatan . the minerail they say be wassador , which be copper , but they call by the name of wassador every mettle 328 whatsoever : they say it be of the colour of our copper , but our copper be better than they :
