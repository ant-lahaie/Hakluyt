slay with the ordinance be very near unto himself : and thereupon haste all that he may , to keep they from the recharge of the ordinance . and notwithstanding their ambuscado , we march or rather run so roundly in to the city of they , as pell mell we enter the gate , and give they saint Domingo more care every man to save himself by flight , than ' reason to stand any long to their break fight . we forthwith repair to the market place : but to be more true understand , a place of very fair spacious square ground , whither also come as have be agree captain Powel with the other troop : which place with some part next unto it , we strengthen with Barricados , and there as the most convenient place assure our self , the city be far too spacious for so small and weary a troop to undertake to guard . somewhat after midnight , they who have the guard of the castle , hear we busy about the gate of the say castle , abandon the same : some be take prisoner , and some flee away by the help of boat to the other side of the haven , and so into the country . the next day we quarter a little more at large , but not into the half part of the town , and so make substantiali trench , and plant all the ordinance , that each part be correspondent to other , we hold this town the space of one month . in the which time happen some accident , more than be well remember for the present , but among other thing , it chance that the general send on his message 112 to the Spaniard a negro boy with a flag of white , signify truce , as be the Spaniard ordinary manner to do there , when they approach to speak to we : which boy unhappy be first meet withal by some of those , who have be belong as officer for the king in the spanish galley , which with the town be late fall into our hand , who without all order or reason , and contrary to that good usage wherewith we have entertained their messenger , furious strike the poor boy through the body with one of their horseman staff : with which wound the boy return to the general , and after he have declare the manner of this wrongful cruelty , die forthwith in his presence , wherewith the general be great passion , command the provost Martiali , to cause a couple of friar than prisoner , to be carry to the same place where the boy be strike , accompany with sufficient guard of our soldier , and there present to be hang , dispatch at the same instant another poor prisoner , with this reason wherefore this execution be do , and with this message further , that until the party who have thus murder the general messenger be deliver into our hand , to receive condign punishment , there shall not day pass , wherein there shall not two prisoner be hang , until they be all consume which be in our hand . whereupon the day follow , he that have be captain of the king galley , bring the offender to the town end , offer to deliver he into our hand ; but it be think to be a more honourable revenge to make they there in our sight , to perform the execution themselves : which be do accord . during our being in this town , as former also at saint Iago there have pass justice upon the life of one of our own company for a odious matter , so here likewise be there a Irishman hang , for the murder of his Corporali . in this time also pass many treaty between their commissioner and we , for ransom of their city ; but ten 113 h upon disagreement we still spend the early morning in fire the outmost house : but they be build very magnificent of stone , with high loft , give we not small travel to ruin they . and albeit for diverse day together we ordain each morning by day break , until the heat begin at nine of the dock , that two hundred mariner do nought else but labour to fire and burn the say house without our trench , while the soldier in a like proportion stand forth for their guard : yet do we not , or can not in this time consume so much as one three part of the town : which town be plain describe and set forth in a certain map and so in the end , what weary with fire , and what hasten by some other respect , we be content to accept of five and twenty thousand ducat of five shilling six penny the piece , for the ransom of the rest of the town . among other thing which happen and be find at saint Domingo , i may not omit to let the world know one very notable mark and token of the unsatiable ambition of the spanish king and his nation , which be find in the king house , wherein the chief governor of that city and country be appoint always to lodge , which be this : in the come to the hall or other room of this house , you must first ascend up by a fair large pair of stair ; at the head of which stair be a handsome spacious place to walk in , somewhat like unto a gallery : wherein upon one of the wall , right over against you as you enter the say place , so as your eye can escape the sight of it , there be describe and paint in a very large scutcheon the arm of the king of Spain , and in the low part of the say scutcheon , there be likewise describe a globe , contain in it the whole circuit of the sea and the earth whereupon be a horse stand on his hinder part within the globe , and the other forepart without the globe , lift up as it be to leap , with a scroll paint in his mouth , wherein be write these word in latin , non sufficit orbis : which be as much to say , as the world suffice not . whereof the meaning be require to be 114 1586 . know of some of those of the better sort , that come in commission to treat upon the ransom of the town , who will shake their head , and turn aside their
