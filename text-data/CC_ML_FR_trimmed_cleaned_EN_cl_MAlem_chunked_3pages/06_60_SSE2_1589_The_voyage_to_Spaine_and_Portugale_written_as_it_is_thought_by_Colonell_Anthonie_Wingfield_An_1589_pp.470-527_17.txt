their thought reach not so high as other , yet do they listen how other man act do pass , and either believe what any man will report unto they , be willing carry away into error , or tie to some great man faith , become secretary against a note truth . the one sort of these do take their opinion from the high way side , or at the further go no further than Pauls to inquire what have be do in this voyage : where , if they meet with any , who capacity before their go out can not make they live , nor their valour maintain their reputation , and who go only for spoil , complain on the hardness and misery thereof , they think they be bind to give credit to these honest man who be party therein , and in very charity become of their opinion . the other to make good the faction they be enter into , if they see any of those malcontent ( as every journey yield some ) do run unto they like tempt spirit 516 to confirm they in their humour , with assurance that they foresee before our go out what will become thereof . be you not therefore too credulous in believe every report : for you see there have be many more beholder of these thing that have pass , than actor in the same ; who by their experience , not have the knowledge of the ordinary want of the war , have think , that to lie hard , not to have their meat well dress , to drink sometime water , to watch much , or to see man die and be slay , be a miserable thing ; and not have so give their mind to the service , as they be any thing instruct thereby , do for want of better matter discourse ordinary of these thing : whereas the journey ( if they have with that judgement see into it , which their place require ) have give they far more honourable purpose and argument of discourse . these man discontentment and mislike before our come home have make i labour thus much to instruct you in the certainty of every thing , because i will not willing have you miscarry in the judgement of they , wherein you shall give i leave somewhat to dilate upon a question , which i only touch in the begin of my letter , namely , whether it be more expedient for our estate to maintain a offensive war against the king of Spain in the low country , or as in this journey , to offend he in his near territory , see the ground of argue thereof be take from the experience which the action of this journey have give a worthy question dilate . they . there be no good subject that will make question , whether it be behooveful for we to hold friendship with these neighbour of we or not , aswell in respect of the infinite proportion of their ship , which must stand either with we or against we ; as of the commodity of their harbour , especial that of Vlishing , by the favour whereof our navy may continual keep the narrow 5 * 7 sea , and which will harbour a great fleet against we , than the Spaniard shall need to annoy we withal , who be now distress by our common enemy , i think it [ ii two . 152 . ] most expedient for our safety to defend they , and if it may be , to give they a reentry into that they have of late year lose unto he . the one without doubt her majesty may do without difficulty , and in so honourable sort as he shall never be able to dispossess she or they of any the town they now hold . but if any man think that the Spaniard may be expel from thence more speedy or convenient by keep a army there , then by send one against he into his own country : let he foresee of how many man and continual supply that army must consist , and what intolerable expense it require . and let he think by the example of the duke of Alva , when the prince of Orange have his great army against he ; and of don Juan , when the state have their mighty assembly against he , how this wise enemy , with who we be to deal , may but by prolong to fight with we , leave we occasion enough for our army within few month to mutiny and break ; or by keep he in his town leave we a spoil field : where though our provision may be such of our own as we starve not , yet be our weakness in any strange country such , as with sickness and misery we shall be dissolve . and let he not forget what a continual burden we hereby lay upon we , in that to repossess those country which have be late lose , will be a war of long continuance than we shall be able to endure . in the very action whereof , what shall hinder the king of Spain to bring his force home unto we ? for it be certain he have long since set down in council , that there be no way for he whole to recover those low country , but by bring the war upon England it self , which have always assist they against he : and that be determine , and whereunto he have be vehement urge by the last year loss he sustain 518 upon our coast , and the great dishonour this journey have lay upon he ; no doubt if we shall give he respite to do it , but he will mighty advance his purpose , for he be rich able thereunto , and wonderful desirous of revenge . to encounter wherewith , i wish even in true and honest zeal to my country , that we be all persuade that there be no such assure mean for the safety of our estate , as to busy he with a well furnish army in Spain , which have so many goodly bay open , as we may land without impeachment as many man as shall be needful for such a invasion . and have a
