Sebastian Cabota , who long before have this secret in his mind : i shall not need here to describe that voyage , forasmuch as the same be large and faithful write in the latin tongue , by that learned young man clement Adam , schoolmaster to the queen henshman , as he receive it at the mouth of the say Richard chancellor . the new navigation and discovery of the king - dome of Moscovia , by the north - east , in the year 1553 : enterprise by sir Hugh willoughby knight , and perform by Richard chancellor pilot major of the voyage : write in latin by Clement Adams . t what time our merchant perceive the commodity and ware of England to be in small request with the country and people about we , and near unto we , and that those merchandize which stranger in the time and memory of our ancestor do earnest seek and desire , upon what occasion , and by who this voyage be set out , and of the discovery of Moscovie by the north . be now neglect , and the price thereof abate , although by we carry to their own port , and all foreign merchandise in great account , and their prize wonderful raise : certain grave citizen of London , and man of great wisdom , and careful for the good of their country , begin to think with themselves , how this mischief may be remedy . neither be a 239 3 - ship furnishedfor the discoverle . remedy ( as it then appear ) want to their desire , for the avoid of so great a inconvenience : for see that the wealth of the Spaniard and Portugal , by the discovery and search of new trade and country be marvellous increase , suppose the same to be a course and mean for they also to obtain the like , they thereupon resolve upon a new and strange navigation . and whereas at the same time one Sebastian Cabota , a man in those day very renown , happen to be in London , they begin first of all to deal and consult diligent with he , and after much speech and conference together , it be at last conclude that three ship shall be prepare and furnish out , for the search and discovery of the northern part of the world , to open a way and passage to our man for travail to new and unknown kingdom . and whereas many thing seem necessary to be regard in this so hard and difficult a matter , they first make choice of certain grave and wise person in manner of a senate or company , which shall lay their head together , and give their judgement , and provide thing requisite and profitable for all occasion : by this company it be think expedient , that a certain sum of money shall public be collect to serve for the furnish of so many ship . and lest any private man shall be too much oppress and charge , a course be take , that every man willing to be of the society , shall disburse the portion of twenty and five pound a piece : so that in short time by this mean the sum of six thousand pound be gather , the three ship be buy , the most part whereof they provide to be new build and trim . but in this action , i wot not whether i may more admire the care of the merchant , or the diligence of the shipwright : for the merchant , they get very strong and well season plank for the building , the shippewright , they with daily travail , and their great skill do fit they for the dispatch of the ship : they calk they , pitch they , and among the 240 rest , they make one most staunch and firm , by a excellent and ingenious invention . for they have hear that in certain part of the ocean , a kind of worm be breed , which many time pierce and eat through the strong oak that be : and therefore that the mariner , and the rest to be employ in this voyage may be free and safe from this danger , they cover a piece of the keel of the ship with thin sheet of lead : and have thus build the ship , and furnish they with armour and artillery , then follow a second care no less troublesome and necessary than the former , namely , the provision of victual , which be to be make provision of accord to the time and length of the voyage . and whereas they afore determine to have the east part of 1 ' ” s ‘ the world sail unto , and yet that the sea towards the same be not open , except they keep the northern tract , whereas yet it be doubtful whether there be any passage yea or no , they resolve to victuali the ship for eighteen month , which they do for this reason . for our man be to pass that huge and cold part of the world , they wise foresee it , allow they six month victuali to sail to the place , so much more to remain there if the extremity of the winter hinder their return , and so much more also for the time of their come home . now this provision be make and carry aboard , chaise of with armour and munition of all sort , sufficient captain captmne and governor of so great a enterprise be as yet want : to which office and place , although many man , ( and some void of experience ) offer themselves , yet one sir Hugh Willoughbie a most valiant gentleman , sir Hugh and well bear , very earnest request to have that care and charge commit unto he : of who before all other , both by reason of his goodly personage ( for he be of a tall stature ) as also for his singular skill in the service of war , the company of the merchant make great account : so that at the last they conclude and make choice of he fo / the general of this voyage , n 241 Q and appoint to he the admiral with authority and command over all the rest . and for the government of other ship although
