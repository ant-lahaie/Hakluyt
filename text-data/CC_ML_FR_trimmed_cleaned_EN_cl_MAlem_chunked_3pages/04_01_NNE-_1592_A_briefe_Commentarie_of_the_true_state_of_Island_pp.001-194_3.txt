name and fame of this or that particular man , sometime inveigh against a whole country , and by shameless untruth disgrace innocent nation and people . again , other of a ingenuous mind , do by great industry , search and bring to light thing profitable : namely , they that write of divinity , Philo - sophy , history and such like : and they who ( take use and experience for their guide ) in the say science have bring thing obscure to light , thing maim to perfection , and thing confuse to order : and they that have faithful commend to everlasting posterity , the story of the whole world : that by their infinite labour have advance the knowledge of tongue : to be short , that endeavour themselves to repress the insolency , confute the slander , and withstand the unjust violence of other , against themselves , their nation or their country : and i for my part , have scarce attain the sight of good letter , and be the mean of all the follower of Minerva ( that i may free acknowledge my own want ) can do no less than become one of their number , who have apply themselves to rid their country from dishonour , to avouch the truth , and to shake off the yoke of railer and reviler . my estate enable i only to write ; howbeit the excellency of truth , and the inbred affection i bear to my country enforce i to do the best i can : since it have please some stranger by false rumour to deface , and by manifold reproach to injury my say country , make it a byeword , and a laughingstock to all other nation . to meet with who insolency and false accusation , as also to detect the error of certain writer concern this hand , unto good and well affect man ( for the common people will be always like themselves , stubbornly maintain that which be false and foolish , neither 96 can i hope to remove they from this accustom and stale opinion ) i have pen the treatise follow . and albeit island be not destitute of many excellent man , who , both in age , wit , and learning , be by many degree my superior , and therefore more fit to take the defence of the country into their hand : notwithstanding , be earnest persuade thereunto , by that godly and famous man Gudbrandus thorlacius bishop of Hola in island , i think good ( to the utmost of my ability ) to be no whit want unto the common cause : both that i may obey his most reasonable request , and also that i may encourage other of my countryman , who have be better train up in good learning , and endue with a great measure of knowledge than i my self , to the defence of this our nation : so far be i from hinder any man to undertake the like enterprise . but to return to the matter , because they ( whatsoever they be ) that reproach and malign our nation , make their boast that they use the testimony of writer : we be serious to consider , what thing , and how true , writer have report of island , to the end that if they have give ( perhaps ) any occasion to other of inveigh against we , their error be lay open ( for i will not speak more sharp ) all the world may see how just they do reproach we . and albeit i nothing doubt to examine some ancient writer of this hand , by the rule of truth and experience : yet ( otherwise ) their memory be precious in our eye , their dignity reverend , their learning to be have in honour , and their zeal and affection towards the whole common wealth of learned man , high to be commend : but as for novice ( if there be any such writer or rather pasquille ) when they shall hear and know true matter concern island , than they themselves have write , they shall seem by their inconstancy and perverse wit to have gain nought else but a black mark of envy and reproach . and that this commentary of i may have some order , it shall be divide into two generail part : the iv 97 g first of the hand , the second of the inhabitant : and of these two but so farforth as those writer which be come to our hand have leave record : because i be not determine to wander out of these list , or to handle more than these thing and some other which pertain unto they . for i profess not my self a historiographer , or geographer , but only a disputer . wherefore omit a long preface , let we come to the first part concern the situation , the name , miracle , and certain other adjunct of this hand . the first section . the isle of Island be sever from other country an infinite distance , stand far into the ocean , and be scarce know unto sailor . albeit a discourse of those thing which concern the land , and the adjunct or property thereof be of little moment to defend the nation or inhabitant from the bite of slanderer , yet seem it in no case to be omit , but to be entreat of in the first place , that the friendly reader perceive how true those writer of island have report in this respect , may thereby also easy judge what credit be to be give unto they in other matter which they have leave write concern the inhabitant , and which other have receive from they as oracle , from whence ( as they say ) they have borrow scoff and taunt against our nation . first therefore , that the distance of island from other country be not infinite , nor indeed so great as man common imagine , it may easy be provide , if one do but in some sort know the true longitude and latitude of the say hand . for i be of opinion that it can exact be know any other way then this , whenas it be
