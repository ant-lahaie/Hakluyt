Damianus de Porto Gruaro, at the com-mandement and direction of the honorable Conradus of the Borough of Gastaldion, and one of the Councell of Utina, have written as faithfully as I could, and have delivered a copie thereof unto the Friers minorites: howbeit not of all, because they are innumerable, and too difficult for me to write.
