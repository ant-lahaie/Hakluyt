These Tartars (they say) are a most barbarous kinde of people, of a browne colour, with long haire on their heads and beardes like the Moscovites: they live by hunting and fishing, and neglect husbandry. This Northerly princedome of Zuegara (as the sayd governour reported to our Fathers) aboundeth with excellent grapes both black and white, which without the labour of man grow naturally in all places, and he promised the Fathers to bring some of these vines to Miac6, that they might be planted there.

Advertisements touching the shippes that goe from Sivil to the Indies of Spaine ; together with some notes of the Contractation house in Sivil.

The Pilot.

Our Pilot must be examined in the Contractation house, and allowed by such as be appointed for the examination of Pilots, that hee be a sufficient man to take the charge in hand, and that which belongeth thereunto, and to governe and lead the same ship directly by his onely commande-

ment to such ports as are convenient for the voyage that hee taketh in hand.

You must have a Master, that must give in sureties to the value of 6000 dukats: and such as be his sureties must be landed men, and their lands worth to the value of that summe aforesayd, if the sayd ship be betweene three or foure hundred tunnes. And if shee be more or lesse of burthen, then he must give sureties of a greater summe or lesse, according to the proportion of her burden.

He shall in all his voyage give a just and true accompt of all such goods, and marchandizes, as shall in all that 442

voyage come into the ship: as also of such plate and money, as shalbe registred in the Kings Register, apper-tayning to the King, or any other particuler marchant: and if any default be, hee or his sureties are to pay all such losses as thereof shall growe: as also to see the mariners payed well and truely, the third part of all such fraights, as the sayde shippe shall get going and comming.

The ship being fraighted by her merchants, the Master shall take order that there be sufficient mariners abourd her to take in such lading from time to time, as the marchant shall send to her: And also the Purser must be The Purser. a man sufficient of abilitie to take, & to give account of all such goods, marchandize, silver and golde, as shall come in and out of the sayd shippe that present voyage, as also give sureties of 1500 dukats at the least to come backe from the Indies in the said shippe, and not to tarrie there, if hee live.

The Master must provide a perfect mariner called a Romager, to raunge, and bestow all marchandize in such A Romager. place as is convenient: and that it be not put in place, where it may perish for lack that it be not fast, sure, and drie, according to the qualitie and forme of the sayd marchandize.

When it is all bestowed, and the shippe able to beare no more, than a mariner called the Countermaster, or Masters mate, hath charge to locke fast the hatches, that The Masters none of the marchants wines, or oyles, or any other kind mate-of marchandize be robbed or spoyled by the mariners.

And if it fortune that any bee so spoyled, then the mariners are to pay for it out of the third part of all the whole fraight of the shippe that doth appertaine to the sayd marchants.

The shippe being laden, goeth to the port wherehence she saileth to goe towards the Indies called S. Lucar, and there one of the chiefe Judges of the Contractation house The chiefe commeth downe to dispatch the shippes that goe together J"d£es in that fleete. And that Judge goeth abourd every ship, and with him hee doth carrie an expert mariner or two '

Visitors being called Visitors of the shippes, to know whether the sayd ‘nen^man' s^’PPe or ships he well tackled: whether they have men Thenamesand sufficient: and in every ship every mans name is taken, markes of men and if he have any marke in the face, or hand or arme, it taken, is written by a Notarie (as well as his name) appertaining to the Contractation house, appointed for these causes. Also the Master is bound to bring backe every mariner againe, and to leave none behinde him there, upon great paines, unlesse he be a passenger appointed by the King at the court, and bringeth his licence from thence for the

same purpose.

The Pragma- The ship must be well appointed with ordinance of tics or orders brassCj anc[ yron, according to The orders of their house, tractatio^	there must want nothing, and every ship is

house. appointed according to her burthen in all kinde of artil-lerie, as peeces of brasse and yron, hand-guns, crossbowes, pikes, swords, daggers, targets, and for all ordinance double shot, with powder, with new cables and ankers sufficient for the voyage. And moreover it is ordeined, that the shippes have double sailes, that is, that they bee thorowly sayled, and moreover all newe sayles of fore-[III. 863.] sayle, and maine-sayle, of coarse, and bonnet newe made, and kept in some driefat or chest in the same ship ; that if the weather take the one from them, the other may be in readines.

Provision of Every ship must have their master sworne before the victuals upon sayj Judge of the Contratacion, that all this is in othe'	a readinesse in the shippe, as also so many newe pipes

of fresh water, so many buttes of good rackt wine, so many kintals of bread, so many jarres of oyle, so many jarres or Botijas of vineger, so much flesh, so much fish, and such quantitie of every kinde of victuali, as the burthen of the shippe requireth, wherein every shippe according to her greatnesse is appointed by The ordinances of the house: Also so many gunners, so many mariners, so many gromettes, so many pages, and so many souldiers. Then all these aforesaide matters being under Register by the notarie and all things prepared for the voyage, the 444

Judge doeth command the masters to hoyse up the yards acrosse unto the howndes of the mastes; and many times, if they perceive the shippe to be walty and overladen, as many covetous masters doe, then hee hangeth the boates in the fore and maine tackle, to see whether the sayd shippe will make any helde downewarde, in laying downe her side: if she doe helde, he commandeth barkes abourd, to discharge her of such lading, as is thought to be too much in her: and there can no ship depart before they cary the Register of the said Judges, howe that shee goeth Register by their order: and every shippe carieth her owne Register, and in the Register the quantitie of al the goods that are laden in her, and if there be any more goods, they be forfayted in the Indies, both shippe and goods.

The masters are bound to keepe the course that the Tie two Admiral doeth leade, and every shippe to follow her, and shee must goe alwayes in the Sea before all the rest of the Qf fleete, and by night cary light, that all may knowe where peace. she goeth. The viceadmirall must come behinde all, and so every shippe in the fleete before her: if any be ill of sayle, all are bounde to fit their sayles in such order, that they goe no faster then she doeth.

The Admiral and the viceadmirall goe never but halfe laden, but very well armed of men, and artillery, three times double and more then any of the other have: because they may help to defend all the rest, if neede doe require: and the dead freight of these two shippes is alwayes borne upon the whole goods that are laden in the fleete, as also at the least there be two hundred souldiers in every of these two shippes besides the mariners, great gunners, gromettes, and other officers.

The voyages bee so appointed, that alwayes they goe Note. and come in the best of Summer, and bee there all the winter in the ports to discharge their lading and recharge backe againe.

The ships that are Admirall and viceadmirall be neither the greatest nor the smallest shippes, but of 3 hundreth or 4 hundreth tunnes at the most: but they be very good

saylers, and strong chosen for the purpose, to sayle well and to beare good store of ordinance. In these two shippes are alwayes going and comming, two good knights men of warre, and Captaines and souldiers expert in the warres.

A Captainein And in every other ship is a Captaine, which ruleth in every ship. causes of controversie, or fights in the seas; the Pilot directeth onely in government and leading the shippe to her port.

All the Captaines, Masters, Pilots, Maryners, and passengers, and all others bee obedient to the two shippes, so appoynted to passe: they doe, as in all other commande-ments what is by them appoynted, having power to hang, or doe any justice upon any man, as to them seemeth good at sea, and this is the last commandement upon payne of death, if the General please.

Concerning the Contractation house, there are therein Sixe Judges, sixe Judges of the highest sort.

Foure visi- There are visitours of shippes, as it is sayd before, to see whether the ships goe in order well, and sufficient in the arte of things: and what manner of men the Masters of the Navigation, ships and Pilots are, whether they be able to answere to all such articles, as the reader is able to objecte unto them, in matters of Navigation: if they be not found sufficient, they are not admitted to take charge.

The master must knowe whether the ship be sufficiently calked, tackled, and furnished in all things accordingly, as with mastes, sayles, cables, ankers, and all other necessary furniture: that at such time as any of the high judges with their ordinary visitours appointed for such causes doe come, there be nothing found out of order or lacking, ^rders^alUd accorchng to The booke of orders, which every shippe °in Spanish proportionable to her burthen ought to have, which is not Pragmatics, unknowen to any of the masters, being in writing common common in among them: and all the charge given to the Master and writing among pnot serveth onely to conduct the ship from port to port.

The counter Master, or masters mate is obedient in all things whereunto hee shall bee commanded by the master 446

and Pilote, and at his commandement are all the maryners of the ship.

The shippes commonly goe deeper laden from Spaine, then our shippes doe in any voyage.

The order of the Catena given to the ships that [HI. 864..] go out of Spaine, to the Indies.

He shippe of what burthen soever shee bee must give a Carena, as they call it in the Spanish tongue, which is in English, shee must be throughly calked, and fortified, as well with carpenters to set knees into her, and any other tymbers appertaining to the strengthening of a shippe, as with

calking: which is to put occam into her sides; and that kinde of calking is not used, as ours is here in England; but first before they put in any threede of occam, they with certaine crooked yrons, with an hammer in one

hande, and the crooked yron in the other, doe forcibly pull out all the olde threede that hath bene in the shippe the voyage before, and so drive in new.

If the seame of the shippe be worne to any bredth, as many olde shippes be, by reason of often raking them, upon that seame there is clapt a piece of caste leade, nayled upon the calking, and seame with speciali nayles, which leade is cast a handes bredth, and as thin ne as may bee for the same purpose, and at every voyage it is taken

off and renued, and by that meanes their shippes are very stanch a yeere or two.

The Carenero or the Calker doeth give in suerties, that if the shippe so cast over, as they doe commonly use to cast them, in such sort as any man may goe drie upon the keele, as I have done, and without any butte, pipe, or any other kinde of timber under her sides, more then with counter-poyze of stones in her, made within certaine timber as though it were a cheste; and with the stones the Carenero doeth bring her as hee will, high and low, leaning, or rysing: and if shee miscarrie in her Carena,
