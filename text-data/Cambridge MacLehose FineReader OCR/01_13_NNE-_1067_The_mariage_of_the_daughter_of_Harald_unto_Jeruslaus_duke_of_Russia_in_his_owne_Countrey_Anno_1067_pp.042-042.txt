The mariage of the daughter of Harald, slaine by William the Conquerour, unto Jeruslaus duke of Russia, taken out of the 9. Booke of the Danish historic written by Saxo Grammaticus. An. D. 1067.

1067.

Araldo caeso, filii ejus duo confestim in Daniam cum sorore migrarunt. Quos Sweno, paterni illorum meriti oblitus consanguineae pietatis more accepit, puellamque Ruthenorum regi Waldemaro, (qui & ipse Jarislaus a suis est appellatus) nuptum dedit. Eidem postmodum nostri temporis

dux, ut sanguinis, ita & nominis haeres, ex filia nepos obvenit. Itaque hinc Britannicus, inde Eous sanguis in salutarem nostri principis ortum confluens communem stirpem duarum gentium ornamentum effecit.

The same in English.

HArald being slaine his two sonnes with their sister sped themselves immediatly into Denmarke. Whom Sweno forgetting their fathers deserts received in most kinde and friendly maner, and bestowed the yong damosell in mariage upon Waldemarus king of Russia who was also called by his subjects Jarislaus. Afterward the said Waldemarus had by his daughter a nephew being duke at this present, who succeeded his predecessour both in lineal descent and in name also. Wherefore the English blood on the one side and the Russian on the other side concurring to the joyfull birth of our prince, caused that mutual kinred to be an ornament unto both nations.
