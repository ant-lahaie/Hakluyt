Howbeit had not this conclusion of league and amitie beene sollicited on the behalfe of your Majestie, his imperiali Highnesse would never have vouchsafed the same unto the kingdome of Poland. But for your Majesties sake his imperiali Highnesse hath exhibited this so singular a favour unto the said king and kingdome of Poland. And hereof your Majestie and the king of Poland ought certainely to be perswaded. We wish your Majestie most happily and well to fare.

Bailie.

To the Worshipfull and his very loving Uncle M. Rowland Hewish Esquier, at Sand in Devonshire.

Ir, considering the goodnesse of your Nature which is woont kindely to accept from a friend, even of meane things being given with a good heart, I have presumed to trouble you with the reading of this rude discourse of my travailes into Turkie, and of the deliverie of the

present with such other occurrents as there happened woorthie the observation: of all which proceedings I was an eie-witnesse, it pleasing the Ambassadour to take mee in with him to the Grand Signior. If for lacke of time to put it in order I have not performed it so well as it ought, I crave pardon, assuring you that to my knowledge I have not missed in the trueth of any thing. If you aske mee what in my travels I have learned, I answere as a noble man of France did to the like demaund, Hoc unum didici, mundi contemptum: and so concluding with the wise man in the booke of the Preacher, that all is vanitie, and one thing onely is necessarie, I take my leave and commit you to the Almightie. From London the 16. March 1597.

Your loving Nephew

Richard Wrag.
