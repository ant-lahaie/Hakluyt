greeting. Right honourable, it hath appeared unto us upon the reading and perusing of the Letters lately sent unto our Highnesse from our deare and loving brother the Emperour, in what part his Majestie tooke the late imployment of our messenger Jerome Horsey in our affaires into Russia: wherein we doe also finde the

honourable endevour used by your Lordship to appease his Highnesse mislike and exception taken aswell to the person of our Messenger, as to our princely letters sent by him : both of which points we have answered in our letters sent by this bearer directed to our sayd loving brother the Emperour : upon perusing whereof we doubt not but his Majestie will be well satisfied touching our sayd Messenger and former letters. And for the honourable course holden by your Lordship in the interposing of your opinion and favourable construction in a thing which might grow to the offence of the league and amitie standing betweene your Soveraigne Lord and us (wherein your Lordship performed the office of an honourable and grave Counsellour) we take our selfe beholding to your Lordship for your readinesse in that behalfe, and doe assure our selfe that the same did proceed of the especiall love and kinde affection that your Lordship hath ever borne and continued towards us, whereof our princely nature will never be unmindfull.

And lastly (which wee take a most assured argument of your undoubted love and affection towards us) that your Lordship hath vouchsafed, and of purpose taken into your hands the protection of our sayd Merchants, and the hearing and determining of all their causes and occasions whatsoever, which shall concerne them or their trade. All which wee conceive to be done for our sake, and therefore do acknowledge our selves t'o be, and still will continue beholding unto you for the same.

And whereas we have made mention in our sayd letters written to our loving brother the Emperour of certeine debts due aswell to our merchants, as to other of our subjects by one William Turnebull a subject of ours late deceased in Russia, wee pray you to be referred to the sayd letter. And forasmuch as the sayd cause will fall under your Lordships jurisdiction by reason of your acceptation of all their causes into your patronage and protection: we are so well assured of your honourable inclination to justice, and your good affection towards our merchants for our sake, that we shall not need to intreat your honourable furtherance either of justice or expedition in the sayd cause. And lastly considering that your noble linage together with your great wisedome and desert hath made you a principali Counsellour and directour of the state of so great a Monarchic, whereby your advice and direction is followed in all things that doe concerne the same, we have given order to our sayd principali Counsellour William Lord Burghley, treasurour of our Realme of England, that as any occasion shall arise to the hinderance of the entercourse betweene
