Olstan sayd, that he departed from Hetha, and arrived at Trusco, in the space of 7. dayes, and 7. nights : during which time, his shippe kept her course continually under saile. All this voyage Wenedland was still upon his steerboord, and on his leerboord was Langland, Layland, Falster,

and Sconie : all which countreyes are subject to Denmarke. Upon his leerboord also, was Bargenland, which hath a Bargenland, private king, unto whom it is subject.
