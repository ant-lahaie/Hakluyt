covet and desire of the commodities you cary with you. It behoveth you to give trifling things unto such people as you shall happen to see, and to offer them all courtesie and friendship you may or can, to winne their love and favour towardes you, not doing or offering them any wrong or hurt. And though you should be offered wrong at their handes, yet not to revenge the same lightly, but by all meanes possible seeke to winne them, yet alwayes dealing wisely and with such circumspection that you keepe your selves out of their dangers.

Thus I beseech God Almightie to blesse you, and prosper your voyage with good and happie successe, and send you safely to returne home againe, to the great joy and rejoycing of the adventurers with you, and all your friends, and our whole countrey, Amen.

Certaine briefe advises given by Master Dee, to Arthur Pet, and Charles Jackman, to bee observed in their Northeasterne discoverie, Ann o 1580.

IF we recken from Wardhouse to Colgoieve Island 400. miles for almost 20. degrees difference onely of longitude very neere East and West, and about the latitude of 70. degrees and two thirde parts : From Colgoieve to Vaigats 200. miles for 10. degrees difference onely in longitude, at 70. degrees of latitude also : From Vaigats to the promontorie Tabin 60. degrees difference of longitude (the whole course, or shortest distance being East and West) in the latitude likewise of 70. degrees, maketh 1200. miles : then is summa totalis from Wardhouse to Tabin 600. leagues, or 1800. English miles. Therefore allowing in a discovery voiage for one day with another but 50. English miles, it is evident that from Wardhouse to Tabin, the course may bee sailed easily in sixe and thirtie dayes: but by Gods helpe it may be finished in much shorter time, both by helpe 262

of winde prosperous, and light continuall for the time requisit thereunto.

When you are past Tabin, or come to the longitude of 142. degrees, as your chart sheweth, or two, three, foure, or five degrees further Easterly, it is probable you shall finde the land on your right hand runne much Southerly and Eastward, in which course you are like either to fall into the mouth of the famous river Oechardes, or some other, which yet I conjecture to passe by the renowmed Citie of Cambalu, and the mouth to be in latitude about 50. or 52. degrees, and within 300. or 400. miles of Cambalu it selfe, being in the latitude of 45. degrees Southerly of the saide rivers mouth, or els that you shall trend about the very Northerne and most Easterly point of all Asia, passing by the province Ania, and then to the latitude of 46. degrees, keeping still the land in view on your right hand (as neere as you may with safetie) you may enter into Quinsay haven, being the chiefe citie in the Northern China, as I terme it for distinctions sake, from the other better knowen.

And in or about either or both of these two warme places, you may to great good purpose bee occupied the whole winter, after your arrivall in those quarters, as sometime by sea, sometime in notable fresh rivers, sometime in discreet view and noting downe the situation of the Cities within land, &c. and ever assaying to come by some charts or maps of the countrey, made and printed in Cathay or China, and by some of their bookes likewise for language, &c. You may also have opportunitie to saile over to Japan Island, where you shall finde Christian men, Jesuits of many countreys of Christendome some, and perhaps some Englishmen, at whose handes you may have great instruction and advise for you affaires in hand.
