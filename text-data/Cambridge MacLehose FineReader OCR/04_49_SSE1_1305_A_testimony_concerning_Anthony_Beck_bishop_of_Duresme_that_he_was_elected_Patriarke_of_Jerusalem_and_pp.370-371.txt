ANthony Beck was bishop of Durisme in the time of the reigne of Edward the first of that name after the invasion of William the great into England. This Anthony was elected patriarch of Jerusalem in the yeere of our Lord God 1305, and was confirmed by Clement the fift, pope of Rome. He was of greater magnificence then for the calling of a bishop. He founded also the castle of Acheland foure miles from Durisme, on the shore of a prety river called Unduglesme. He much beautified with new buildings Eltham mannor being nere unto Greenwich, and the castle Somaridune in the county of Lindsey. And lastly, he built new out of the ground the palace of London, which now is in the possession of prince Edward. Insomuch, that at length, through his over great magnificence and power he procured to himselfe great envy among the nobility, which he could not asswage during the rest of his life. But of this Anthony & of his writings we will speake more at large in our booke intitled of the Britain bishops. This Anthony finished his life in the yere of our Lord God 1310, and in the reigne of king Edward the second.
