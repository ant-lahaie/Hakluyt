A Nd here I shall not ( as I suppose ) commit any great inconvenience , or absurdity , in adding unto this History of the new world , certain particulars as touching the first discovery thereof , not commonly known . Which discovery all the writers of our time ascribe ( & that not unworthily ) unto Christopher Columbus . For by him it was in a manner first discovered , made known , and profitably communicated unto the Christian world , in the year of our Lord 1492. Howbeit I find that the North part thereof called Estotiland , ( which most of all extendeth towards our Europe and the Islands of the same , namely , Groneland , Island , and Frisland , ) was long ago found out by certain fishers of the Isle of Frisland , driven by tempest upon the shore thereof : and was afterwards about the year 1390 discovered a new , by one Antonio Zeno a gentleman of Venice ; which sailed thither under the conduct of Zichmni king of the said Isle of Frisland , a prince in those parts of great 464

Of which expedition of Zichmni there are extant in Italian certain collections or abridgements gathered by Francisco Marcolino out of the letters of M. Nicolo and Antonio Zeni two gentlemen of Venice which lived in those parts . Out of which collections I do add concerning the description of Estotiland aforesaid these particulars following . 
 Estotiland ( says he ) aboundeth with all things necessary for mankind . In the mids thereof stands and exceeding high mountain , from which issue foure rivers that moisten all the country . The inhabitants are witty and most expert in all Mechanical arts . They have a kind of peculiar language and letters . Howbeit in this Kings Library are preserved certain Latin books , which they understand not , being perhaps left there not many years before by some Europeans , which trafficked thither . They have all kind of metals ; but especially gold , wherewith they mightily abound . They traffic with the people of Groneland : from whence they fetch skins , pitch and brimstone . The inhabitants report that towards the South , there are regions abounding with gold , and very populous : they have many and huge woods , from whence they take timber for the building of ships and cities , whereof and of castles there are great store . The use of the loadstone for Navigation is unknown unto them . They make relation also of a certain region towards the South , called Drogio , which Drogio . is inhabited by Canibals , unto whom men flesh is delicate meat : whereof being destitute they live by fishing , which they use very much . Beyond this are large regions , and as it were a new world : but the people are barbarous and go naked : howbeit against the cold they cloth themselves in beasts skins . These have no kind of metal : and they live by hunting . Their weapons are certain long staves with sharp points , and bows . They wage wars one against another . They have governors , and obey certain laws . But from hence

 more towards the South the climate is much more temperate : and there are cities , and temples of idols , unto whom they sacrifice living men , whose flesh they afterwards devour . These nations have the use of silver and gold . 
 Thus much of this tract of lands out of the aforesaid collections or abridgements . Wherein this also is worthy the observation , that even then our Europaean Pilots sailed those seas by the help of the loadstone . For concerning the use thereof in Navigation , I suppose there is not to be found a more ancient testimony . And these things I have annexed the rather unto this table of Mar deal Zur ; considering that none of those Authors which have written the Histories of the New world , have in any part of their writings , mentioned one word thereof . Hitherto Ortelius .
