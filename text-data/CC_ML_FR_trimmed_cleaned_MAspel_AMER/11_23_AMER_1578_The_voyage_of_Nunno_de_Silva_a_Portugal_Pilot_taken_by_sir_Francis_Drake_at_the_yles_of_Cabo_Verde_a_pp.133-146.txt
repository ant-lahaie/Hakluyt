The relation of a Voyage made by a Pilot called 1579. Nuno da Silva for the Viceroy of new Spaine , the 20. of May , in the year of our Lord 1579. in the city of Mexico , from whence it was sent to the Viceroy of the Portugall-Indies : wherein is set down the course and actions passed in the Voyage of Sir Francis Drake that took the aforesaid Nuno da Silva at S. Iago one of the Islands of Cabo Verde , and carried him along with him through the Straights of Magellan , to the Haven of Guatulco in new Spaine , where he let him go again . 
 Uno da Silva born in Porto , a Citizen and inhabitant of Guaia , says , that he departed out of his house in the beginning of November in the year of our Lord 1577. taking his course to Cabo Verde , or The green Cape , where he anchored with his Ship close by the 
 Haven of the Island of Sant Iago , one of the Islands of Cabo Verde aforesaid , being the nineteenth of 133 
 January in the year of our Lord 1578. And lying there , there came sixe ships , which seemed to be Englishmen , whereof the Admiral boarded his ship , and by force with his men took him out of his ship , bringing him in the boat aboard the Admirals ship , leaving some of his best men aboard his ship : and although the fortress of the Island shot foure or five times at them , yet they hurt not the Englishmen : who having done , set sail from thence to the Island of Brava , taking with them the ship of the said Nuno dam Silva : being there , they filled certain vessels with fresh water : from thence holding their course inward to sea , having first with a boat set the men of Nuno da Silvas ship on land , only keeping Nuno da Silva in his ship , as also his ship with the wines that were therein . And Nuno da Silva says , the cause why they kept him on board was , because they knew him to be a pilot for the coast of Brasilia , that he might bring them to such places in those countries' as had fresh water . 
 Being put off " from the Island of Brava , they held their course to the land of Brasilia , which they descried upon the first of Aprill , under the height of thirtie degrees : and without landing or taking in fresh water , Rio de Plata , they held on their course to Rio de la Plata , that is , The river of silver , lying under five and thirtie degrees , little more or less : where they went on land , and provided themselves of fresh water . 
 From thence they held on their course till they came under nine and thirtie degrees , where they anchored : and being there they left two of their sixe ships behind them , and sailed but foure in company ( that of Nuno da Silva being one ) till they came to the Bay called Bay de las Baya de las Islas , that is , The Bay of the Hands , lying under nine and fortie degrees , where it is said , that Magellan lay and wintered there with his ship , when he first discovered the Straight , which now holds his name . Into this Bay the twentieth of June they entered , and there anchored so close to the land , that they might 134 
 send to it with a harquebus shot : and there they saw the land to be inhabited with Indians , that were appareled with skins , with their legs from the knees downward , and their arms from the elbows downward naked , all the rest of their bodies being clothed , with bows and arrows in their hands , being subtle , great , and well formed people , and strong and high of stature : where sixe of the Englishmen went on land to fetch fresh water , and before they leapt on land , foure of the Indians came unto their boat , to whom the Englishmen gave bred and wine : and when the Indians had well eaten and drunk , they departed thence : and going somewhat far from them , one of the Indians cried to them , and said : Magallanes , Esta he minha Terra , that is , Magallanes , this is my country : and because the Englishmen followed them , it seemed the Indians fled upward into the land , and being somewhat far off , they turned back again , and with their arrows slew two of the English shippers , one being and Englishman , the other a Netherlander : the rest came back again and saved themselves in the boat , wherewith they presently put off from the shore . Here they stayed till the seventeenth of August , upon the which day they set sail , running along by the coast about a league and a half from the land , ( for there it is all fair and good ground , at twentie , and five and twentie fathom deep ) and were about foure or five days before they came to the mouth or entry of the Straight : but because the wind was contrary , they stayed till the 24 of August before they entered . 
 The entry or mouth of the Straight is about a league The descrif-broad , on both sides being bore and flat land : on the turn of The North side they saw Indians making great fires , but on the South side they saw no people stirring . The foure * ‘ 
 and twentieth day aforesaid , they began to enter into the Straight , with and Eastnortheast wind . This Straight may be about and hundred and tenne leagues long , and in breadth a league . About the entry of the Straight , and 
 J35 
 half way into it , it runneth right forth without any windings or turnings : and from thence about eight or tenne leagues towards the end , it hath some boutes and windings , among the which there is one so great a hook or headland , that it seemed to run into the other land : and there it is less then a league broad from one land to the other : and from thence forward it runneth straight out again : And although you find some crookings , yet they are nothing to speak of . The issue of the Straight lies Westward , and about eight or tenne leagues before you come to the end , then the Straight begins to be broader , and it is all high land to the end thereof , after you are eight leagues within the Straight , for the first eight leagues after you enter is low flat land , as I said before : and in the entry of the Straight you find the stream to run from the South sea to the North sea . 
 And after they began to sail in with the Eastnortheast wind , being entered they passed along without any let or hindrance either of wind or weather : and because the high land on both sides lay covered with snow , and that all the Straight is fair and clear , they held their course a harquebus-shot in length from off the North side , having nine and tenne fathom depth , with good ground , as I said before , where ( if need require ) a man may anchor : the hills on both sides being full of trees , some of the hills and trees reaching down to the sea - side in some places having plain and even land : and there they saw not any great rivers , but some small rivers that issued out of the riffes and breaches of the land : and in the country where the great Cape or crooking is , on the South side they saw certain Indian fishermen in their Canoas or skiffs , being such as they saw first on the North side , but more people they saw not on the South side . 
 Being out of the Straight on the other side , upon the sixt of September of the aforesaid year , they held their course Northwest for the space of three days , and the third day they had a Northeast wind , that by force drave them Westsouthwest , which course they held for 136 
 the space of ten or twelve days with few sails up : and because the wind began to be very great , they took in all their sails , and lay driving till the last of September . 
 The 24 day of the same month having lost the sighed of This was the one of their ships which was about and hundred tun , then again they hoist sail because the wind came Winter's better , holding their course Northeast for the space of seven days , and at the end of the said seven days , they had the sighed of certain Islands , which they made towards for to anchor by them , but the weather would not permit them : and being there , the wind fell Northwest : whereupon they sailed Westsouthwest . 
 The next day they lost the sighed of another ship of their company , for it was very foul weather , so that in the end the Admirals ship was left alone , for the ship of Nuno da Silva was left in the Bay where they wintered before they entered into the Straights : and with this foul weather they ran till they were under seven and They were fiftie degrees , where they entered into a haven of and drivenunt0 Island , and anchored about the length of the shot of a great piece from the land , at twentie fathom deep , latitude . where they stayed three or foure days , and the wind coming Southward , they weighed anchor , holding their course Northward for the space of two days , and then they espied a small unhabited Island , where being arrived , they stroke sails , and hoist out their boat , and there they took many birds and Seals . 
 The next day they set sail again , holding their course Northnortheast , and North , to another Island lying five The Isle of or sixe leagues from the firm land , on the North side Mocha in 38. of the Straight , where they anchored about a quarter 3°‘ mm ' of a league from the land , in twelve fathom water . 
 This Island is small and low land , and full of Indians , the Island being altogether possessed and inhabited by them , where they hoised out their boat , wherein the Admiral and twelve Englishmen entered , going to fetch fresh water , and to seek for victuals : and being landed upon the Island , the Indians in exchange of other things , 137 
 brought two Spanish sheep , and a little Maiz or roots whereof they make bred , and because it was late , they returned again unto their ship , without doing any other thing for that day . 
 The next day the said Captain with the aforesaid twelve men being harquebusiers , rowed to land again , and set two of their company on shore with their vessels to fetch fresh water , and by the place where they should fill their water there lay certain Indians secretly hidden , that fell upon the two Englishmen and took them : which they in the boat perceiving , went out to help them , but they were so assailed with stones & arrows , that all or Sir Frandt the most part of them were hurt , the Captain himself being wounded with and arrow on the face , and with and w u ' other arrow in the head , whereby they were constrained to turn back again , without once hurting any of the Indians , and yet they came so near the boat , that they took foure of their oars from them . This done , they set sail again , running along the coast with a South wind , sailing so for the space of sixe days , passing by the haven called Sant Iago , and put into another haven , and there they took and Indian that lay fishing in a Canoa , giving him linen and butchers chopping knives , with other trifles , and not long after there came another Indian aboard their ship called Felippe , and he spoke Spanish , he gave the English Captain notice of a certain ship that lay in the haven of Sant Iago , which they had left sixe leagues behind them : with that intelligence the Indian being their guide , the next day they set sail and went to the aforesaid haven of S. Iago , and entering therein , they took the said ship , wherein they found a thousand seven hundred and 70 Botijas or Spanish pots full of wine , and other things : which having done , they leapt on land , where they took certain sacks with meal , with whatsoever they could find ; they took likewise the ornaments and the relics out of the Church , wherewith they departed from thence , taking the aforesaid ship , with two 138 
 men ( that they found in her ) with them , and so departed from that haven , which lies under 32 degrees and a half , running along by the coast till they came under one and thirtie , and thirtie degrees : which was the place where they had appointed to meet , and there to stay for each other , if by tempest or foul weather they chanced to be separated , and so lose eke others company . 
 And coming under thirtie degrees , they found a very good haven , whereinto they entered , and anchored at sixe fathom deep , the shot of a great piece from the land , which was right over against a river , where they took in sixe pipes of fresh water : and to defend them that fetched the water , they set twelve men upon the land , and being busied in filling of their water , they espied a company of men coming towards them , whereof half of them were Spaniards , being about two hundred and fifty horsemen , and as many footmen , but they had no sooner espied them , but they presently entered into the boat , and escaped away , losing but one man . 
 The same night they set sail again with both their ships , running along the coast about ten leagues farther , where they took in some fresh water , but because they perceived certain horsemen , they departed without lading any more water . 
 From thence they followed on their course along the coast for the space of 30. leagues , where they entered into a desert or unhabited haven : yet they went not on land , for every day they saw people upon the shore , & there they made out a small pinnace , the pieces whereof they brought ready framed out of England , and having prepared it , they launched it into the water , wherein the Captain with fifteene men entered with the chief boatesman called John the Greek , ( being Master of the ship which they had taken in the haven of S. Iago , ) wherewith they went to see if they could find the two ships that they had lost by stormy 139

 weather , as I said before : and likewise thinking to go on land to fill certain vessels with fresh water , they durst not venture , for they saw people on all sides of the shore : so that in the end they returned again without hearing of the other ships : being there , they took all the ordinance out of their ship , and new dressed and rigged her : which done , they put a small piece of ordinance into the pinnace , wherewith they set sail again , following on their course . 
 Having sailed thirteene days , they came to and Island lying about the shot of a base from the land , where they anchored , and there they found foure Indian fishermen in two Canoas who told them that on the firm land they might have fresh water , but they understanding that there was not much , and that it was somewhat within the land , would not spend any time about it , but set sail again , leaving the fishermen with their Canoas , following on their course along by the shore . 
 The next day being somewhat further , they espied certain Indian fishermen that were upon the land in their houses , which the English captain perceiving , presently entered into his pinnace , and rowed on land , where he took three of the said fishermen , taking with him half of the fish that lay packed upon the shore ready to be laden , with the which Indians and booty , they came on board again . 
 The next day following , they saw a bark laden with fish , that belonged to the Spaniards , with foure Indians in it . This bark with the Indians and the fish they took , and bound the Spanish ship to their stern , and so drew it after them , leaving the said Indians within it , who by night unbound the bark , and secretly made away with bark and fish , and were not more seen . The next day the Captain went into the pinnace , and because fie saw certain houses upon the shore , he made thither , and being on land , he found two men in them , one whereof he took , leaving the other 
 140 
 behind , and there he found three thousand pezos of silver , ( every pezo being the valve of a rial of eight , ) and seven Indian sheep , and hens , & took all ■ whatsoever they found : wherewith they departed from thence , following on their course . And two days after they came to the haven called Arica , where they found Arica . two ships , the one laden with goods and Spanish wares , out of the which they took only two hundred Botijas , or Spanish pots with wine , and out of the other seven and thirty bars of silver , which are pieces of ten or twelve pound eke bar , and thinking to leap on shore ( with two barks that they found in the said haven , with about seven and thirty harquebusses and bows ) they perceived on the land certain horsemen coming towards them , whereupon they left off their pretence , and took with them a Negro that they found in the barks , with whom they returned aboard . 
 The next day in the morning they burned the ship , that was laden with the Spanish wares , and took the other with them , passing forward with it on their course , the Captain sailing along the shore with his pinnace , and the ship keeping about a league from him to seaward , to seek for a ship whereof they had intelligence : and having in that manner sailed about five and forty leagues , they found the ship that lay at anchor in a haven , who about two hours before had be advertised of and English pirate or sea-rover , and had discharged eight hundred bars of silver out of her , and hidden it on the land , which silver belonged to the king of Spaine , of the which silver the English - men had received some intelligence , but they durst not go on land , because there were many Indians and Spaniards that stood to guard it , and they found nothing in the ship but three pipes of water : the ship they took with them , and being about a league in the sea , they hoised up all her sails and let her drive , doing the like with the ship that they had taken in Arica , as 
 141 
 also the other of Sant Iago , which likewise they let drive , following on their course with their own ship , and the pinnace . 
 Being seven or eight leagues from the haven of Calao de Lyma , they espied three ships , and boarding one of them , they took three men out of her , and so held on their course towards Calao de Lyma , where they entered , being about two or three hours within night , sailing in between all the ships that lay there , being seventeene in number : and being among the ships , they asked for the ship that had laden the silver , but when answer was made them , that the silver was laid on land , they cut the cables of the ships , and the masts of two of the greatest ships , and so left them . At the same time there arrived a ship from Panama laden with wares and merchandise of Spaine , that anchored close by the English ship , which was , while the English Captain sought in the other ships for the silver . Assoon as the ship of Panama had anchored , there came a boat from the shore to search it : but because it was in the night , they let it alone till morning , and coming to the English ship , they asked what ship it was : whereupon one of the Spanish prisoners ( by the English Captains commandment ) answered and said it was the ship of Michael Angelo , that came from Chili : which they of the boat hearing sent a man on board , who climbing up , light upon one of the great pieces , wherewith he was afraid , and presently stepped back again into the boat ( because the ships that lay there , and that sailed in those countries' , used to carry no great shot ) and therewith they were abashed , and made from it : which the ship of Panama hearing , that was newly come in , she judged it to be a rover , and therewith cutting her cables , she put to sea , which the Englishmen perceiving , shipped certain men in their pinnace , and followed her : and being hard by her , they bad her strike , which they of the ship refused to do , and with a harquebus shot 
 142 
 killed one of the Englishmen , wherewith they turned again into their ship , and presently set sail , following after the ship , which not long after they overtook : which they of the ship perceiving hoised out their boat , and leaping into it , rowed to the land , leaving the ship with all the goods , which the Englishmen presently took , and with her sailed on their course . 
 The next day they saw a boat with sails making towards them , whereby they presently mistrusted it to be a spy , and not long after they perceived two great ships coming towards them , which made the English think they came to fight with them , whereupon they let the ship of Panama drive , therein leaving John the Greek , with the two men that they had taken the same day that they entered into the Calao de Lyma , as I said before , and presently hoised all their sails , and sailed forward , not once setting eye again upon the aforesaid ships , for they made towards the ship of Panama , which the Englishmen let drive . From thence they sailed again along the coast , following on their course : and having sailed certain days , they met a frigate that went towards Lyma , laden with wares and merchandises of the country , from whence the Englishmen took a lamp and a fountain of silver , and asked the pilot being a Spaniard , if they met not with a ship , that they understood should be laden with silver , but the one Pilot said he met her not , and the other said he saw her about three days before . This frigate came not to the ship , but to the pinnace , wherein the Captain sailed , for the pinnace ran close by the shore , and the ship kept a league and a half from the land : whereupon they let the frigate go , following on their course . 
 Two days after , they came to the haven called Payta , Payta . where they found a ship laden with Spanish wares , which the pinnace boarded , and took without any resistance : for assoon as the Spaniards perceived the Englishmen , they presently made to land with their boat , and two of them leapt into the sea , none staying in the ship , but 
 143 
 the Master , Pilot , and some Negroes , out of the which ship the Englishmen took the pilot , and all the bred , hens and a hog , and so sailed forward with the ship : but being about two harquebus shot to seaward , they let it go again , not taking any thing out of it , and asking after the ship , which they sought for , they told them that about two days before she departed from that place , wherewith they followed on their course , and before night they met with a ship of Panama , which they presently boarded , but took nothing from her but only a Negro , and so left it , holding on their course . 
 The next day being the first of Februarie , they met another ship that sailed to Panama , laden with fish and other victuals , and fortie bars of silver , and some gold , but I know not how much , which they took , and sent the passengers ( with two friars that were in her ) in a boat to land . The next day they hanged a man of the ship , because he would not confess two plataeae of gold that he had taken , which after they found about him : which done , they let the ship drive , following on their course . 
 The first of March towards noon , they espied the ship laden with silver , being about foure leagues to seaward from them : and because the English ship was somewhat heavy before , whereby it sailed not as they would have it , they took a company of Botijas or A / retie de - Spanish pots for oil , and filling them with water , hung vice to make them by ropes at the stern of the ship to make her sail on wiftl^ better : and the ship that sailed towards Panama swJty - maje towards the English ship to know what she was , thinking it to be one of the ships that used to sail along the coasts , and to traffic in the country : and being hard by her , the English Captain bad them strike , but the other refusing to do it , with a great piece he shot her mast overboard , and having wounded the Master with and arrow , the ship presently yielded , which they took , and sailed with her further into the sea , all that night and the next day and night , making all the way they could . 
 144 
 The third day being out of sighed of the land , they began to search the ship , and to lade the goods out of her into their ship , which was a thousand three hundred bars or pieces of silver , and foureteene chests with ryals of eight , and with gold : but what quantity it was I know not , only the passengers said that there was great store , and that three hundred bars of the silver belonged to the king , the rest belonged to certain merchant's . That done , they let the ship with the men sail on their course , putting the three pilots in her that they brought with them , so that as then they had none but their own men aboard , being the sixt of March , and from thence they held their course towards the land of Nicaragua . 
 The thirteenth of March , either the day before or after , in the morning they descried land , not being very high , being a small Island two leagues from the firm land , and there they found a small Bay , wherein they anchored at five fathom deep close by the land , and there they stayed till the twentie day . Upon the which day there passed a Frigate close by the Island , which with their pinnace they followed , and taking her , brought her to the English ship , which frigate was laden with Salsaperilla , and Botijas or pots with butter and honey , and with other things . The English Captain went on board , and cast the Salsaperilla on the land , leaving all the rest of the wares in the frigate , and then he put all his pieces into the frigate , that so he might lay his ship on shore , to new calk and trim her , which continued till the three and twentie or foure and twentie of March . Which done , and having made provision of wood and fresh water , they held on their course along by the coast , sailing Westward , taking the said frigate and her men with them , and having sailed two days , they took their men out of her , and set them in the pinnace , among the which were foure sailors , that meant to sail to Panama , and from thence to China , whereof one they took , with the letters and patents that he had about him , among

 And so sailing until the sixt of Aprill , about evening they discovered a ship that held two leagues to seaward from the land : and before the next day in the morning they were hard by her , and suddenly fell upon her while her men slept , and presently made the men enter into their ship , among the which was one DONE Francisco Xarate . Which done , they followed on their course with the said ship , out of the which they took certain packs and other wares , but I know not what it was . They likewise took a Negro out of it , and three days after they both let the ship and men go whither they would , setting therein the two sailors that should go for China , which they had taken in the frigate , keeping only one sailer to show them where they should find fresh water , to the which end they took the empty vessels with them to fill with water , and so kept on their course to the haven of Guatulco , where they put in , being upon Munday the thirteenth of Aprill , and having anchored , they stayed there till the sixe and twentie of Aprill : and about three or foure hours within the night , they set sail , holding their course Westward , and and hour or two before they let Nuno da Silva go , putting him into another ship , that lay in the haven of Guatulco . 
 From thence forward the Englishmen passed on their voyage , to the Islands of Malucos , and from thence they passed by the Cape de Buena Esperanza , and so to England , as it is well known , so that thjs is only the description of the voyage that they made , while the said pilot Nuno da Silva was with them .
