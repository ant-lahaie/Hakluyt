 In one word ; The time serves , the like occasion seidome happeneth in many ages , the former repeated considerations do all jointly together importune us , now , or never to make our selves rich , our posterity happy , our Prince every way stronger then our enemies , and to establish our Country in a state flourishing and peaceable . O let not then such and indignity rest on us , as to deprave so notable and enterprise with false rumours , and vain suppositions , to sleep in so serious a matter , and renouncing the honour , strength , wealth , and sovereignty of so famous a conquest , to leave all unto the Spaniard .

 1 These are enemies to the laos , their money is of white and green stones . They speak the Tivitivas language ; so likewise do the nation of the Arricari , who have greater store of those moneys then any others . 2 Here it was as it seems , that Vincent Pinzon the Spaniard had his Emeralds . In one of these two rivers certain Frenchmen that suffered shipwreck some 2. or 3. years since , do live . 3 . 4. 5. These with the other two seem to be branches of the great river of Amazones .

 the mouth thereof , the inhabitants do pass with their canoas in 20. days to the salt lake , where Manoa stands . The water hath many Cataracts like Caroli , but that they are of greater distance one from another : where it falls into the sea , hills do enclose it on both sides . 
 10 The freshet shoots out into the sea , with great force : the sea does here sometime camp high , and break , as if it were full of rocks : but in proof it is nothing else but the pride & force of the tides . In this bay , & round about , so far as the mountains do extend there is great store of Brasill wood , some of it bearing far darker colour then other some . Here are also many sorts of other good woods . 
 14 These speak the language of the Indians of Dominica . They are but few , but very cruel to their enemies . For they bind , and eat them alive piecemeal . This torment is not comparable to the deadly pain that comes of hurts , or wounds , made by those arrows that are envenomed with the juice of you herb Wapototo . These Indians because they eat them whom they kill , use no poison . The sea coast is nowhere populous , for they have much wasted themselves , in mutual wars . But now in all parts so far as Orenoque , they live in league and peace . 
 21. Near the head of this river , Capeleppo falls out of the plains , and runneth into the Sea with Curitini . Some of the Guianians live in this river . 
 39. This river , as also most of the rest , is not navigable above sixe days journey by reason of rocks . It is tenne days journey to the head , where the Guianians do dwell : honey , yarn or cotton , silk , Balsamum , and Brasil-493

 beds are here to be had in plenty , and so all the coast alongst Eastward . Some images of gold , spleenestones , and others may be got on this coast , but they do somewhat extraordinarily esteem of them , because every where they are current money . They get their Moons , & other pieces of gold by exchange , taking for each one of their greater Canoas , one piece or image of gold , with three heads , and after that rate for their lesser Canoas , they receive pieces of gold of less valve . One hatchet is the ordinary price for a Canoa . They have every where diverse sorts of drugs , gums , and roots , which I doubt not by farther trial , will be found medicinable .
