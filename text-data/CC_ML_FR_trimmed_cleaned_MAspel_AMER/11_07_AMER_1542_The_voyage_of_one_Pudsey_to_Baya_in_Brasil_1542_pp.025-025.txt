 Lso the worshipful M. Edward Cotton of Southampton Esquire gave me more particularly to understand , how that one Pudsey of Southampton , a man of good skill and resolution in marine causes , made a voyage in like manner 62. years ago to Baya de 
 todos los Santos the principali town of all Brasil , and the seat of the Portugal viceroy and of the bishop , and that he built a fort not far distant from that place , in the foresaid year 1542.
