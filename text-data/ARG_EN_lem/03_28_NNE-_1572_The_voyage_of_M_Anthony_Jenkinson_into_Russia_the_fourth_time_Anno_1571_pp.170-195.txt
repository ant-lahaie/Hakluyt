 he say 26. day i arrive with the two good ship call the swallow and the Harry in safety , at the bay of S. Nicholas in Russia aforesaid , and land at rose island , from whence immediate i send away my interpreter Daniel Silvester in post towards the court , 
 be then at the Moscow , whereby his majesty may as well be advertise of my arrival in his dominion , as also to know his highness pleasure for my further access . And remain at the say island two or three day , to have conference with your agent about your affair , i do well perceive by the word of the say agent and other your servant , that i be enter into 
 170 
 great peril and danger of my life : for they report to i that they hear say at the Moscow , that the prince displeasure be such against i , that if ever i come into his country again , i shall loose my head , with other word of discouragement . whereat i be not a little dismayed , not know whether it be best for i to proceed forward , or to return home again with the ship for the safeguard of my life . but call to mind my innocence and good meaning , and know my self not to have offend his majesty any manner of way either in word or deed , or by make former promise not perform , heretofore by my enemy false surmise : and be desirous to come to the trial thereof , whereby to justify my true deal , and to reprove my say enemy as well here as there , who have not cease of late by untrue report to impute the cause of the say emperor displeasure towards you to proceed of my deal , and promise make to he at my last be with he ( although by his letter to the queen majesty , and by his own word to i the contrary do appear ) i determine with my self rather to put my life into his hand , and by the providence of God to prosecute the charge commit unto i , than to return home in vain , discourage with the word of such , who have rather that i have tarry at home , than to be send over with such credit , whereby i may sift out their evil do , the only cause of your loss . 
 wherefore , leave the say ship the nine and twenty day of the month , i depart from the seaside , and the first of August arrive at Colmogro , where i remain attend the return of my say messenger with order from his majesty . 
 but all the country be sore visit by the hand of God with the plague , passage in every place be shut up , that none may pass in pain of death : my messenger be eight hundred mile upon his way , be stay , and keep at a town call Shasko , and may not be suffer to go any further , neither yet to return 
 171 
 back again , or send unto i : by mean wnereof in the space of four month , i can neither hear nor know what be become of he , in which time my say messenger find mean to advertise the governor of the ci tie of Vologda , as well of his stay , as of the cause of his come thither , who send he word that it be not possible to pass any near than prince without further order from his majesty , who be go to the war against the Swethens , and that he will advertise his highness as soon as he may convenient : and so my say messenger be force to remain there still without answer . during which time of his stay through the great death ( as aforesaid , ) i find mean to send another messenger , with a guide by a unknown way through wilderness , a thousand mile about , think that way he shall pass without let : but it prove contrary , for likewise he be pass a great part of his journey , fall into the hand of a watch , and escape very hardly , that he and his guide with their horse have not be burn , accord to the law provide for such as will seek to pass by indirect way , and many have feel the smart thereof which have not wherewith to buy out the pain : neither can that messenger return back unto i . 
 and thus be i keep without answer or order from his majesty , and remain at the say colmogro , until the 18. of January follow , neither have a gentleman to safeguard i , nor lodging appoint i , nor allowance of victual accord to the country fashion for ambassador , which argue his grievous displeasure towards our nation . and the people of the country perceive the same , use towards i and my company some discourtesy : but about the 28. day aforesaid , the plague cease , and the passage be open , there come order from his majesty that i shall have post horse , and be suffer to depart from Colmogro to go to a city call peraslave near to the court , his majesty be new return from the say war . 
 172 
 and i arrive at the say peraslave the 3. of February , where i remain under the charge of a gentleman , have then a house appoint i , and allowance of victual , but so strait keep , that none of our nation or other may come or send unto i , nor i to they . and the 14. of march follow , i be send for to the court , and be within three mile of the same , a post be send to the gentleman which have charge of i , to return back again with i to the say peraslave , and to remain there until his majesty further pleasure , wherewith i be much dismay , and marveil what that sudden change mean , and the rather , because it be a troublesome time , and his majesty much disquiet through the ill success of his affair , ( as i do understand . ) and the twenty of the same , i be send for again to the court , and the 23. i come before his majesty , who cause i to kiss his hand , and give gracious audience unto my oration , grateful receive and accept the queen majesty princely letter , and her present , in the presence of all his nobility . after i have finish my oration , too long here to rehearse , and deliver her highness letter , and present ( as aforesaid ) the emperor sit in royal estate stand up and say , how do queen Elizabeth my sister , be she in health ? to who i answer , God do bless her majesty with health , and peace , and do wish the like unto thou lord , her love brother . than his majesty sit down again , command all his nobility and other to depart , and avoid the chamber , save the chief secretary , and one other of the counsel , and will i to approach near unto he with my interpretor , say unto i these word . 
 Anthony , the last time thou be with we here , we do commit unto thou our trusty and secret message , to be declare unto the queen majesty herself thy mistress at thy come home , and do expect thy come unto we again at the time we appoint , with a full answer of the same from her highness . 
 173 
 and in the mean time there come unto we at several ! time three messenger , the one call manly , the other George Middleton , and Edward goodman , by the way of the narve about the merchant affair : to who we send our messenger to know whether thou Anthony , be return home in safety , and when thou shall return unto we again : but those messenger can tell we nothing , and do miscall , and abuse with evil word , both our messenger and thou , wherewith we be much offend . And understand that the say goodman have letter about he , we cause he to be search , with who be find many letter , wherein be write much against our princely estate , and that in our empire be many unlawful thing do , whereat we be much grieve , and will suffer none of those rude messenger to have access unto we : and short after we be inform that one Thomas Randolfe be come into our dominion by the way of Dwina , ambassador from the queen , and we send a gentleman to meet and conduct he to our city of Moscow , at which time we look that thou shall have return unto we again . and the say Thomas be arrive at our say city , we send unto he diverse time , that he shall come and confer with our counsel ! , whereby we may understand the cause of his come , look for answer of those our princely affair commit unto thou . but he refuse to come to our say counsel : wherefore , and for that our say city be visit with plague , the say Thomas be the long keep from our presence . which be cease , forthwith we give he access and audience , but all his talk with we be about merchant affair , and nothing touch we . we know that merchant matter be to be hear , for that they be the stay of our princely treasure : but first prince affair be to be establish , and then merchant . after this the say Thomas Randolfe be with we at our city of Vologda , and we deal with he about our princely affair , 174 
 whereby amity betwixt the queen majesty and we may be establish for ever , and matter be agree and conclude betwixt your ambassador and we , and thereupon we send our ambassador into England with he to end the same : but our ambassador return unto we again , without finish our say affair , contrary to our expectation , and the agreement betwixt we , and your say ambassador . 
 thus when his majesty have make a long discourse , i humble beseech his highness to hear i gracious , and to give i leave to speak without offence , and to believe those word to be true which i shall speak . which he grant , and these be my word . 
 most noble and famous prince , the message which thy highness do send by i unto the queen her most excellent majesty touch thy princely and secret affair , immediate , and so soon as i come home , i do declare both secret and true unto the queen majesty her self , word for word , as thou lord do command i . which her highness do willing hear and accept , and be mindful thereof , and willing to answer the same , the next ship after , her majesty do send unto thou , lord , her highness ambassador Thomas Randolfe , who approve wisdom and fidelity be unto her majesty well know , and therefore think meet to be send to so worthy a prince , who have commission not only to treat with thy majesty of merchant affair , but also of those thy princely and secret affair commit unto i . and the cause ( most gracious prince ) that i be not send again , be , for that i be employ in service upon the sea against the queen majesty enemy , and be not return home at such time as master Thomas Randolfe depart with the ship , to come into thy majesty country , otherwise i have be send . and whereas thy majesty say , that Thomas Randolfe will not treat with thy counsel of the matter of his legation , he do ( lord ) therein accord to his com-175 
 mission : which be : first to deal with thy majesty thy self , which order be common use among all prince , when they send their ambassador about matter of great weight . and whereas the say Thomas be charge that he agree and conclude upon matter at the same time , and promise the same shall be perform by the queen her majesty : whereupon ( lord ) thou do send thy ambassador with he into England , for answer thereof : it may please thy majesty to understand , that as the say Thomas Randolfe do confess , that in deed he have talk with thy highness , and counsel diverse time about princely affair : even so he deny that ever he do agree , conclude , or make any promise in any condition or order , as be allege , otherwise then it shall please the queen her majesty to like of at his return home , which he do justify to thy highness ambassador his face in England . wherefore , most mighty prince , it do well appear , that either thy ambassador do untrue inform thy majesty , or else thy princely mind , and the true meaning of the queen highness her ambassador , for want of a good interpretor , be not well understand : and how thankful the queen her majesty do receive thy highness commendation , and letter send by thy majesty ambassador , and how gracious she give he audience sundry time , use he with such honour in all point for thy sake , lord , her love brother , as the like be never show to any ambassador in our realm , and how honourable with full answer in all thing , her majesty dismiss he , when he have finish all thy princely affair ( as it seem ) to his own contentation , it may well appear by a true certificate late send with her highness letter unto thou lord , by her messenger Robert beast , and her majesty do suppose that that thy ambassador will have make report accord , and that by he thy highness will have be satisfy in all thing : otherwise she will have send her majesty ambassador with 
 176 
 he unto thou lord again . but now her highness perceive that thy majesty be not full satisfy in thy princely affair , neither by Thomas Randolfe , her highness ambassador , nor by thy own ambassador Andrea - AndrewSavin Savin , nor yet by her majesty letter send by the said - ambauadour Andrea : and also understand thy great grief and 6 displeasure towards sir William garret , and his company , merchant traffic in thy majesty dominion , have think good to send i at this present unto thou lord emperor , and great duke , as well with her highness fill mind , touch thy princely aflaire , as also to know the just cause of thy majesty say displeasure towards the say company of merchant : and have command i to answer to all thing in their behalf , and accord to their true meaning . for her highness do suppose thy majesty indignation to proceed rather upon the evil , and untrue report of thy late ambassador in England , and of such wicked person of our nation resident here in thy highness dominion , rebel to her majesty , and their country , then of any just desert of the say merchant , who never willing deserve thy highness displeasure , but rather favour in all their do and meaning . and since the first time of their trafiik-ing in thy majesty dominion , which be now nineteen year , the say merchant have be , and be always ready and willing true to serve thy highness of all thing meet for thy treasury , in time of peace and of war in despite of all thy enemy : although the prince of the east sea be agree to stop the sound , and the way to the narve , and have bring , and do bring from time to time such commodity to thou , lord , as her majesty do not suffer to be transport forth of her realm to no other prince of the world . and what great loss the say sir William garret , with his company have sustain of late year in this trade , as well by shipwreck , as by false servant it be manifest know : and what service the say company ship do unto thy majesty against thy enemy , two year past 
 three 177 m 
 in go to the narve , when they fight with the king of pole ship freebooter , and burn the same and slay the people , and as many as be take alive deliver unto thy captain at the narve , i trust thy highness do not forget . wherefore most mighty prince , the premise consider , the queen her most excellent majesty thy love sister , do request thy highness to restore the say sir William garret with his company into thy princely favour again , with their privilege for free traffic with thy accustom goodness and justice , to be minister unto they throughout all thy majesty dominion , as aforetime : and that the same may be signify by thy princely letter , direct to thy officer in all place , and thy highness commandment or restraint to the contrary notwithstanding . and further that it will please thy majesty , not to give credit to false report , and untrue suggestion of such as be enemy , and such as neither will have mutual amity to continue betwixt your majesty , nor yet intercourse betwixt your country . and such rebel of our nation , as Ralph Rutter , and other which lie lurk here in thy highness dominion , seek to sow dissension betwixt your majesty by false surmise , spend away their master good riotous , and will not come home to give up their account , advance themselves to be merchant , and able to serve thy highness of all thing fit for thy treasury , whereas indeed they be of no credit , nor able of themselves to do thy majesty any service at all : the queen highness request be , that it will please thy majesty to command that such person may be deliver unto i to be carry home , lest by their remain here , and have practise and friendship with such as be not thy highness friend , their evil do may be a cause hereafter to withdraw thy goodness from sir William garret and his company , who have true meaning in all their do , and be ready to serve thy highness at all time , use many other word to the advancement of your credit , 178 
 and the disgrace of your enemy , and so i end for that time . 
 then say his majesty , we have hear you , and will consider of all thing further , when we have read the queen our sister letter : to who i answer , that i suppose his majesty shall by those letter understand her highness full mind to his contentation , and what want in writing , i have credit to accomplish in word . wherewith his majesty seem to be well please , and command i to sit down . and after pause a while , his majesty say these word unto i , it be now a time which we spend in fast , and pray , be the week before easter , and for that we will short depart from hence , towards our border of novgorod , we can not give you answer , nor your dispatch here , but you shall go from hence , and tarry we upon the way , where we will short come , and than you shall know our pleasure , and have your dispatch . and so i be dismiss to my lodging , and the same day i have a dinner ready dress send i from his majesty , with great store of drink , of diverse sort , and the next day follow , be the four and twenty of march aforesaid , the chief secretary to his majesty , send unto i a gentleman , to signify unto i , that the emperor majesty pleasure be , i shall immediate depart towards a city , call otwer , three hundred mile from the aforesaid Sloboda , and there to tarry his highness come unto a place call staryt , three score mile from the say otwer .
