a brief relation of the notable service perform by sir Francis drake upon the spanish fleet prepare in the road of Cadiz : and of his destroy of 100 sail of bark ; pass from thence all along the coast to cape Sacre , where also he take certain fort : and so to the mouth of the river of Lisbon , and thence cross over to the isle of Sant Michael , supprize a mighty carrack call the sant fillip come out of the east India , which be the first of that kind that ever be see in England : perform in the year 1587. â€™Er majesty be inform of a mighty furnish with preparation by sea begin in Spain for the invasion of England , by good advice of her grave and prudent counsel think it expedient to prevent the same . whereupon she cause a fleet of some 30. sail to be rig and all thing necessary . over that fleet she appoint general sir Francis Drake ( of who manifold former good service she have sufficient proof ) to who she cause 4. ship of her navy royal to be deliver , to wit , the Bonaventure wherein himself go as general ; the lion under the conduct of master William Borough controller of the navy ; the dreadnought under the command of m. Thomas Venner ; and the rainbow , captain whereof be m. Henry Bellingham : unto which 4 ship two of her pinass be appoint as handmaid . there be also add unto this fleet certain tall ship of the city of London , of who especial good service the general make particular mention in his private letter direct to her majesty . this fleet set sail from the sound of 438 Plymouth in the month of April towards the coast of Spain . the 16. of the say month we meet in the latitude of 40. degree with two ship of Middleborough , which come from Cadiz ; by which we understand that there be great store of warlike provision at Cadiz and thereabouts ready to come for Lisbon . upon this information our general with all speed possible , bend himself thither to cut off their say force and provision , upon the 19 of April enter with his fleet into the harbour of Cadiz : where at our first enter we be assail over against the town by six galley , which [ ii two . 122. ] notwithstanding in short time retire under their fortress . there be in the road 60. ship and diverse other small vessel under the fortress : there flee about 20. French ship to port real , and some small spanish vessel that may pass the sholde . at our first coming in we sink with our shot a ship of Raguza of a 1000 ton , furnish with 40. piece of brass and very rich lade . there come two galley more from saint mary port , and two from porto real , which shoot free at we , but altogether in vain : for they go away with the blow well beat for their pain . before night we have take 30. of the say ship , and become master of the road , in despite of the galley , which be glad to retire they under the fort : in the number of which ship there be one new ship of a extraordinary hugeness in burden above 1200. ton , belong to the marquess of Santa Cruz be at that instant high admiral of Spain . five of they be great ship of Biskay , whereof 4. we fire , as they be take in the king provision of victual for the furnish of his fleet at Lisbon : the five be a ship about 1000 ton in burden , lade with iron-spike , nail , iron hoop , horseshoe , and other like necessary bind for the west Indies we fire in like manner . also we take a ship of 250. ton lade with wine 439 for the king provision , which we carry out to the sea with we , and there discharge the say wine for our own store , and afterward set she on fire . Moreover we take 3. Flyboats of 300 - ton a piece lade with biscuit , whereof one be half unlade by we in the harbour , and there fire , and the other two we take in our company to the sea likewise there be fire by we ten other ship which be lade with wine , raisin , fig , oil , wheat , and such like . to conclude , the whole number of ship and bark ( as we suppose ) then burn , sink , and bring away with we , amount to 30. at the least , be ( in our judgement ) about 10000 ton of ship . there be in sight of we at Porto real about 40. ship , beside those that flee from Cadiz . we find little ease during our abode there , by reason of their continual shoot from the galley , the fortress , and from the shore : where continual at place convenient they plant new ordinance to offend we with : beside the inconvenience which we suffer from their ship , which , when they can defend no long , they set on fire to come among we . whereupon when the flood come we be not a little trouble to defend we from their terrible fire , which nevertheless be a pleasant sight for we to behold , because we be thereby ease of a great labour , which lie upon we day and night , in discharge the victual , and other provision of the enemy . thus by the assistance of the almighty , and the invincible courage and industry of our general , this strange and happy enterprise be achieve in one day and two night , to the great astonishment of the king of Spain , which bread such a corrasive in the heart of the mark of Santa Cruz high admiral of Spain , that he never enjoy good day after , but within few month ( as May just be suppose ) die of extreme grief and sorrow . thus have perform this notable service , we come out of the road of Cadiz on the Friday morning the 440 21. of the say month of April , with very small loss not worth the mention . after our departure ten of the galley that be in the road come out , as it be in disdain of we , to make some pastime with their ordinance , at which time the wind scant upon we , whereupon we cast about again , and stand in with the shore , and come to anchor within a league of the town ; where the say galley , for all their former brag , at length suffer we to ride quiet we now have have experience of galley-fight : wherein i can assure you , that only these 4. of her majesty ship will make no account of 20. galley , if they may be alone , and not busy to guard other . there be never galley that have better place and fit opportunity for their advantage to fight with ship : but they be still force to retire , we ride in a narrow gut , the place yield no better , and drive to maintain the same , until we have discharge and fire the ship , which can not convenient be do but upon the flood , at which time they may drive clear off - we . thus be victual with bread and wine at the enemy cost for diverse month ( beside the provision that we bring from home ) our general dispatch captain cross into England with his letter , give he further in charge to declare unto her majesty all the particularity of this our first enterprise . after who departure we shape our course towards cape Sacre , and in the way thither we take at several time of ship , bark , and caravel well near a hundred , lade with hoop , galley-oar , pipe-stave , and other provision of the king of Spain , for the furnish of his force intend against England , all which we burn , have deal favorable with the man and send they on shore . we also spoil and consume all the fisher-boat and net thereabouts , to their great hindrance : and ( as we suppose ) to the utter overthrow of the rich fish of their tunies for the same year . at length 441 A.D. I587 - the carrack call the sanct fillip take . the english voyage we come to the aforesaid cape Sacre , where we go on land ; and the better to enjoy the benefit of the place , and to ride in harbour at our pleasure , we assail the same castle , and three other strong hold , which we take some by force and some by surrender . Thence we come before the haven of Lisbon anker near unto Cascais , where the mark of Santa Cruz be with his galley , who see we chase his ship a shore , and take and carry away his bark and caravel , be content to suffer we there quiet to tarry , and likewise to depart , and never charge we with one canon-shot . and when our general scent he word that he be there ready to exchange certain bullet with he , the mark refuse his challenge , send he word , that he be not then ready for he , nor have any such commission from his king . Oure general thus refuse by the mark , and see no more good to be do in this place , think it convenient to spend no long time upon this coast : and therefore with consent of the chief of his company he shape his course towards the isle of the azore , and passs towards the isle of saint Michael , within 20. or 30. league thereof , it be his good fortune to meet with a Portugal carrack call Sant Philip , be the same ship which in the voyage outward have carry the 3. prince of Japan , that be in Europe , into the Indies . this carrack without any great resistance he take , bestow the people thereof in certain vessel well furnish with victual , and send they courteous home into their country : and this be the first carrack that ever be take come forth of the east Indies ; which the Portugal take for a evil sign , because the ship bear the king own name . the riches of this prize seem so great unto the whole company ( as in truth it be ) that they assure themselves every man to have a sufficient reward for his travel : and thereupon they all resolve to return home for England : which they happy do , and arrive in 442 Plymouth the same summer with their whole fleet and this rich booty , to their own profit and due commendation , and to the great admiration of the whole kingdom . and here by the way it be to be note , that the take of this carrack wrought two extraordinary effect in England : first , that it teach other , that carrack be no such bug but that they may be take ( as since indeed it have fall out in the take of the Madre de Dios , and fyre and sink of other ) and second in acquaint the english nation more general with the particularity of the exceed riches and wealth of the east Indies : whereby themselves and their neighbour of holland have be encourage , be man as skilful in navigation and of no less courage than the Portugal to share with they in the east Indies : where their strength be nothing so great as heretofore have be suppose .
