a brief note concern a voyage of one Thomas Tison a english man , make before the year 1526. to the west Indies , and of his abode there in manner of a secret factor for some english merchant , which under hand have trade thither in those day : take out of a old ligier-booke of m. Nicolas Thorne the elder , a worshipful merchant of Bristol . 
 t appear out of a certain note or letter of remembrance , in the custody of i Richard Hakluyt , write 1526. by master Nicolas Thorne the elder , a principali merchant of Bristol , unto his friend and factor Thomas midnail , and his servant William Ballard at that time 
 remain at saint Lucar in Andaluzia : that before the say year one Thomas Tison a Englishman have find the way to the west Indies , and be there resident : unto who the aforesaid m. Nicolas Thorne send armour and other commodity specify in the letter aforesaid . This Thomas Tison ( so far as i can conjecture ) may 
 seem to have be some secret factor for m. thorn and other english merchant in those remote part ; whereby it be probable that some of our merchant have a kind of trade to the west Indies even in those ancient time and before also : neither do i see any reason why the Spaniard shall debar we from it at this present .
