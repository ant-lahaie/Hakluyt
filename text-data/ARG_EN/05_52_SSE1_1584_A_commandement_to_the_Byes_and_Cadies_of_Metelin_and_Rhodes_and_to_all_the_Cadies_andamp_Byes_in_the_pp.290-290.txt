This commaundement comming to you, know that the Embassadour of England required of us our commaundement that their ships comming to Chio, & from thence to Constantinople, no man should hurt them or offer any violence, either in the way on the sea or on the land, or in the portes. I have commaunded, that their ships comming to any of the said places or ports with marchandise, if they themselves will, they may sell their commodities, & as much, and as Title as they will, and if it be in a place where custome was not woont to be taken, having taken the custome due by the olde Canon you suffer them not to bee injuried, either in the way, portes, or other places, but that they may come in quietnesse to Constantinople, and certifie us of those that be disobedient to our commaundement, and give credite to our seale. And having read this our commandement, give it to them againe.{n}.
