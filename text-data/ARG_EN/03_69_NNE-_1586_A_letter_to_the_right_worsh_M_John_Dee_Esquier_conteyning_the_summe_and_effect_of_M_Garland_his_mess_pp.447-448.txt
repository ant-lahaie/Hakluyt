And for the great goodwill that his Majestie beareth unto you, he will give you yeerely toward your mainteinance 2000. pound starling; and the Lord Protectour will give you a thousand rubbles, as also your provision for your table you shall have free out of his Majesties kitchin : And further whatsoever you shall thinke needefull or convenient for you, in any part or parts of his dominion, it shall be at your worships commaundement.

BoSmia: to which place this M. Edward Garland came to M. Dee with two Moscovites to serve him, &c. He had sixe more, which by M. Dees counsell were sent backe.
Witnesse M. Edward Kelley, and M. Francis Garland, brother to the foresaid Edward, and divers others.
IT seemeth that this princely offer of the Emperour Pheodor Ivanowich, and of the L. Boris Pheodorowich Protectour to his Majestie, was made unto the learned and famous Mathematitian M. John Dee, partly to use his counsell & direction about certaine discoveries to the Northeast; and partly for some other weighty occasions : but because their conquest to Siberia was not as then fully settled, & for divers other secret reasons, it was for yâ€˜ time with al thankfulnes refused.
