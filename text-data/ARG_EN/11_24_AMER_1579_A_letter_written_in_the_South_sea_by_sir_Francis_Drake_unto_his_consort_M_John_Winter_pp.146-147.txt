Hereafter followeth the copie of a letter written by sir Francis Drake (being in the South sea of New Spaine, in his ship called The Pellican or the Golden Hinde with the ship of Sant John de Anton, which hee had taken) to his companions in the other shippes that were of his company, 146{n}and by foule weather separated from him, as I said before: The contents whereof were these:{n}Master Winter, if it pleaseth God that you should chance to meete with this ship of Sant John de Anton, I pray you use him well, according to my word and promise given unto them, and if you want any thing that is in this ship of Sant John de Anton, I pray you pay them double the value for it, which I will satisfie againe, and command your men not to doe her any hurt: and what composition or agreement we have made, at my returne into England I will by Gods helpe perfourme, although I am in doubt that this letter will never come to your hands: notwithstanding I am the man I have promised to be: Beseeching God, the Saviour of all the world, to have us in his keeping, to whom onely I give all honour, praise and glory. What I have written, is not only to you M. Winter, but also to M. Thomas, M. Charles, M. Caube, and M. Anthonie, with all our other good friendes, whom I commit to the tuition of him that with his blood redeemed us, and am in good hope, that we shal be in no more trouble, but that he will helpe us in adversitie, desiring you for the Passion of Christ, if you fall into any danger, that you will not despaire of Gods mercy, for hee will defend you and preserve you from all danger, and bring us to our desired haven, to whom bee all honour, glory, and praise for ever and ever. Amen. Your sorowfull Captaine, whose heart is heavy for you:	Francis Drake.{n}.
