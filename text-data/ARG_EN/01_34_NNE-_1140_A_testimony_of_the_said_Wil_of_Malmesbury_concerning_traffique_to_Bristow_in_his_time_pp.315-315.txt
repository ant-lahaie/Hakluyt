The aforesaid William of Malmesburie writeth of traffike in his time to Bristowe in his fourth booke de gestis pontificum Anglorum, after this maner.
N eadem valle est vicus celeberrimus Bristow nomine, in quo est navium portus ab Hibernia & Norwegia & caeteris transmarinis terris venientium receptaculum, ne scilicet genitalibus divitiis tam fortunata regio peregrinarum opum frauderetur commercio.
The same in English.
IN the same valley stands the famous Towne of Bristow, with an Haven belonging thereunto, which
is a commodious and safe receptacle for all ships directing their course for the same, from Ireland, Norway, and Norway. other outlandish and foren countreys: namely that a region so fortunate and blessed with the riches that nature hath vouchsafed thereupon should not bee destitute of the wealth and commodities of other lands.
