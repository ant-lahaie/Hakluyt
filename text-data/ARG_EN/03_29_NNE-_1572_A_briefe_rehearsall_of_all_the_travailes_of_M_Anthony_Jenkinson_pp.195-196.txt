The names of such countries as I Anthony Jenkinson have travelled unto, from the second of October 1546, at which time I made my first voyage out of England, untill the yeere of our Lord 1572, when I returned last out of Russia.{n}First, I passed into Flanders, and travelled through all the base countries, and from thence through Germanic, passing over the Alpes I travelled into Italy, and from thence made my journey through Piemont into France, throughout all which realme I have throughly journied.{n}I have also travelled through the kingdomes of Spaine and Portingal, I have sailed through the Levant seas every way, & have bene in all the chiefe Islands within the same sea, as Rhodes, Malta, Sicilia, Cyprus, Candie, and divers others.{n}I have bene in many partes of Grecia, Morea, Achaia, and where the olde citie of Corinth stoode.{n}I have travelled through a great part of Turkie, Syria, and divers other countries in Asia minor.{n}I have passed over the mountaines of Libanus to Damasco, and travelled through Samaria, Galile, Philistine or Palestine, unto Jerusalem, and so through all the Holy land.{n}I have bene in divers places of Affrica, as Algiers, Cola, Bona, Tripolis, the gollet within the gulfe of Tunis.{n}195{n}A.D.{n}1572.{n}[I. 412. J I have sailed farre Northward within the Mare glaciale, where we have had continuall day, and sight of the Sunne ten weekes together, and that navigation was in Norway, Lapland, Samogitia, and other very strange places.{n}I have travelled through all the ample dominions of the Emperour of Russia and Moscovia, which extende from the North sea, and the confines of Norway and Lapland, even to the Mare Caspium.{n}I have bene in divers countries neere about the Caspian sea, Gentiles, and Mahomeans, as Cazan, Cremia, Rezan, Cheremisi, Mordoviti, Vachin, Nagaia, with divers others of strange customes and religions.{n}I have sailed over the Caspian sea, & discovered all the regions thereabout adjacent, as Chircassi, Comul, Shascal, Shirvan, with many others.{n}I have travelled 40 daies journey beyond the said sea, towards the Oriental India, and Cathaia, through divers deserts and wildernesses, and passed through 5 king-domes of the Tartars, and all the land of Turkeman and Zagatay, and so to the great citie of Boghar in Bactria, not without great perils and dangers sundry times.{n}After all this, in An. 1562, I passed againe over the Caspian sea another way, and landed in Armenia, at a citie called Derbent, built by Alexander the great, & from thence travelled through MMia, Parthia, Hircania, into Persia to the court of the great Sophie called Shaw Tamasso, unto whom I delivered letters from the Queenes majestie, and remained in his court 8 moneths, and returning homeward, passed through divers other countries. Finally I made two voyages more after that out of England into Russia, the one in the yeere 1566, and the other in the yeere 1571. And thus being weary and growing old, I am content to take my rest in mine owne house, chiefly comforting my selfe, in that my service hath bene honourably accepted and rewarded of her majestie and the rest by whom I have bene imploied.{n}.
