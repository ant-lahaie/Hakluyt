And the 11. yeere of William Rufus King of England.{n}He Christian armie of Godfrie of Bouillon passing the citie of Iconium, alias Agogna in the countrey of Licaonia, and from thence by the city of Heraclia, came at length unto the ci tie of Marasia, where they encamped, and sojourned there three whole dayes, because of the wife{n}of Baldwine brother germane of the duke of Loraigne.{n}Â«93{n}Which Lady being long time vexed with a grievous  malady, was in extremitie, where at length paying the debt due to nature, she changed this transitorie life, for life eternall; Who, in her life time, was a very worthy and vertuous Lady, borne in England, and descended of most noble parentage named Gutwere; Which, according to her degree, was there most honourably enterred, to the great griefe of all the whole armie.
