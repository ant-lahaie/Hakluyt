AFterward Edgar being sonne unto the nephewe of Edward the confessour, travelled with Robert the sonne of Godwin a most valiant knight, unto Jerusalem. And it was at the same time when the Turkes besieged king Baldwin at Rama : who not being able to endure the straight siege, was by the helpe of Robert especially, going before him, and with his drawen sword making a lane, and slaying the Turkes on his right hande and on his left, delivered out of that danger, and escaped through the midst of his enemies campe. But upon his happie successe being more eager and fierce, as hee went forward somewhat too hastily, his sworde fell out of his hand. Which as he stouped to take up, being oppressed with the whole multitude, hee was there taken and bound. From whence (as some say) being carried unto Babylon or Alcair in Egypt, when he would not renounce Christ, he was tyed unto a stake in the midst of the market place, and being shot through with arrowes, died a martyr. Edgar having lost his knight returned, and being honoured with many rewards both by the Greekish and by the Germaine Emperour (who both of them would right gladly have entertained him stil for his great nobilitie) contemned all things in respect of his native soile. For in very deede some are so inveagled with the love of their countrey, that nothing can seeme pleasant unto them, unlesse they breath in the same aire where they were bred. Wherefore Edgar being misledde with a fond affection, returned into England ; and afterward being subject unto divers changes of fortune (as we have above signified) he spendeth*now his extreeme olde age in an obscure and private place of the countrey.
