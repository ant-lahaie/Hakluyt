For when his father Midas was advertised by the Oracle, that the said gulfe should not be shut up, before things most precious were cast into it: Anchurus deeming nothing to be more invaluable then life, plunged himselfe alive downe headlong into that bottomeles hole ; and that with so great vehemencie of mind, that neither by his fathers request nor by the allurements and teares of his most amiable wife, he suffered himselfe to be drawne backe from this his enterprise.{n}Sperthius also and Bulls, two Lacedemonians, were not much inferiour to the former, who to turne away the revenge of Xerxes that most puissant King of the 89{n}Persians, entended against the Lacedemonians, for killing the ambassadors of his father Darius, hyed them unto the sayd king, and that he might avenge the am-bassadours death upon them, not upon their countrey, with hardy, and constant mindes presented themselves before him.{n}The very same thing (most gracious prince) which moved them, and many others being enflamed with the love of their countrey, to refuse for the benefite thereof, no danger, no trouble, no nor death it selfe, the same thing (I say) hath also enforced me, not indeed to undergoe voluntarie death, or freely to offer my selfe unto the slaughter, but yet to assay that which I am able for the good of my countrey : namely, that I may gather together and refute the errors, and vaine reports of writers, concerning the same : and so take upon me a thing very dangerous, and perhaps subject to the sinister judgement of many.{n}In this purpose the example of Cneius Pompeius hath likewise confirmed me : who being chosen procurator for corne among the Romanes, and in an extreme scar-cetie and dearth of the citie, having taken up some store of graine in Sicilia, Sardinia, and Africa, is reported to have had greater regard of his countrey, then of himselfe. For when he made haste towards Rome, and a mighty and dangerous tempest arising, he perceived the Pilots to tremble, and to be unwilling to commit themselves to the rigor of the stormie sea, himselfe first going on boord, and commanding the anchors to be weighed, brake foorth into these words: That we should sayle necessitie urgeth : but that we should live, it urgeth not. In which words he seemeth wisely to inferre, that greater care is to be had of our countrey lying in danger, then of our owne private safetie.{n}SIf small with great as equals may agree :{n}And Flie with Elephant compared bee.{n}Namely that gathering together and laying up in store those things which might be applied to succour the fame and credite of our nation, having now this long time bene oppressed with strangers, through the envie of certeine malicious persons, I boldly adventure to present these fewe meditations of mine unto the viewe of the world, and so hoysing up sailes to commit my selfe unto a troublesome sea, and to breake foorth into the like speeches with him : That I should write necessitie urgeth : but that my writings in all places should satisfie every delicate taste, or escape all peevishnes of carpers it urgeth not. I doubt not but many will allow this my enterprise : the successe perhaps all men will not approve. Nevertheles, I thought that there was greater regard to be had of my countrey, susteining so many mens mocks and reproches, then of mine owne praise or dispraise, redounding perhaps unto me upon this occasion. For what cause should move me to shunne the envie and hate of some men, being joyned with an indevour to benefite and gratifie my countrey?{n}But if I shall seeme somewhat too bold in censuring The errors of the errors of writers, or too severe in reprehending the writers oj slanders of some men : yet I hope all they will judge	r{n}indifferently of me, who shall seriously consider, how intolerable the errors of writers are, concerning our nation : how many also and how grievous be the reproches of some, against us, wherewith they have sundry wayes provoked our nation, and as yet will not cease to provoke. They ought also to have me excused in regard of that in-bred affection rooted in the hearts of all men, towards their native soile, and to pardon my just griefe for these injuries offered unto my countrey. And I in very deed, so much as lay in me, have in all places moderated my selfe, and have bene desirous to abstaine from reproches : but if any man thinke, we should have used more temperance in our stile, I trust, the former reason will content him.{n}Sithens therefore, I am to undergoe the same hazard,{n}which I see is commonly incident to all men, that publish any writings : I must now have especiall regarde of this one thing: namely, of seeking out some patron, and Meccenas for this my briefe commentary, under whose name and protection it may more safely passe through the hands of all men.{n}But for this purpose I could not finde out, nor wish for any man more fit then your royal Majestie, most gratious prince. For unto him, who hath received under his power & tuition our lives and goods, unto him (I say) doe we make humble sute, that he would have respect also unto the credit of our nation, so injuriously disgraced.{n}Yea verily (most gracious King) we are constreined to crave your Majesties mercifull aide, not only in this matter, but in many other things also which are wanting in our countrey, or which otherwise belong to the publique commoditie and welfare thereof: which not by me, but by the letters supplicatory of the chiefe men of our nation, are at this time declared, or will shordy be declared. For we doubt not but that your sacred Majestie, after the example of your Christian predecessors, will vouchsafe unto our countrey also, amongst other Islands of your Majesties dominion, your kingly care and protection. For as the necessitie of fleeing for redresse unto your sacred Majestie, is ours: so the glory of relieving, regarding, and protecting us, shal wholy redound unto your sacred Majestie : as also, there is layd up for you, in respect of your fostering and preserving of Gods church, upon the extreme northerly parts almost of the whole earth, and in the uttermost bounds of your Majesties dominion (which by the singular goodnes of God, enjoyeth at this present tranquillitie and quiet safetie) a reward and crowne of immortali life in the heavens.{n}But considering these things are not proper to this place, I wil leave them, and returne to my purpose which I have in hand : most humbly beseeching your 92{n}S. M. that you would of your clemencie vouchsafe to become a favourer and patron unto these my labours and studies, for the behalfe of my countrey.{n}It now remaineth (most gracious and mercifull sove-reigne) for us to make our humble prayers unto almighty God, that king of kings, and disposer of all humane affaires, that it would please him of his infinite goodnes, to advance your Majestie (yearely growing up in wisedome & experience, and all other heroicall vertues) to the highest pitch of sovereigntie : and being advanced, continually to blesse you with most prosperous successe in all your affaires : and being blessed, long to preserve you, as the chief ornament, defence and safegarde of these kingdomes, and as the shield and fortresse of his church : and hereafter in the life to come, to make you shine glorious like a starre, amongst the principali nurcing fathers of Gods Church, in the perfect joy of his heavenly kingdome. The same most mercifull father likewise grant, that these praiers, the oftener they be dayly repeated and multiplied in every corner of your Majesties most ample territories & Islands, so much the more sure and certein they may remaine, Amen. At Haffhia, or Copen Hagen 1593. in the moneth of March.{n}Y. S. M.{n}most humble subject, Arngrimus Jonas, Islander.{n}To the courteous and Christian reader Gudbrandus  Thorlacius, Bishop of Holen in Island, wisheth health.{n}Here came to light about the yeare of Christ 1561, a very deformed impe, begotten by a certain Pedlar of Germany: namely a booke of German rimes, of al that ever were read the most filthy and most slanderous against the nation of Island. Neither did it suffice the base printer once to send abroad that base brat, but he must publish it also thrise or foure 93{n}Great errors grow upon mariners fabulous reports.{n} times over : that he might thereby, what lay in him, more deepely disgrace our innocent nation among the Germans, & Danes, and other neighbour countries, with shamefull, and everlasting ignominie. So great was the malice of this printer, & his desire so greedy to get lucre, by a thing unlawfull. And this he did without controlment, even in that citie, which these many yeres hath trafficked with Island to the great gaine, and commodity of the citizens. His name is Joachimus Leo, a man worthy to become lions foode.{n}Moreover, there are many other writers found, who when they would seeme to describe the miracles of nature, which are thought to be very many in this Island, & the maners, & customs of the Islanders, have altogether swarved from the matter and truth it selfe, following mariners fables more trifling then old wives tales, & the most vain opinions of the common sort. These writers, although they have not left behind them such filthy & reprochful stuffe as that base rimer : yet there are many things in their writings that wil not suffer them to be excused, & altogether acquited from causing an innocent nation to be had in derision by others. Wherefore marking, reading, & weighing these things with my selfe, & considering that there dayly spring up new writers, which offer injury to the fame & reputation of the Islanders, being such men also as do shamelesly filtch out of other mens labours, deluding their readers wc feined descriptions, & a new rehearsal of monsters, I often wished that some one man would come forth, to make answere to the errors of historiographers & other unjust censurers : and by some writing, if not to free our innocent nation from so many reproches, yet at leastwise, in some sort to defend it, among Christian & friendly readers. And for this cause I have now procured an honest and learned young man one Arngrimus Fitz-Jonas, to peruse the works of authors, that have written any thing concerning Island, and by sound reasons to detect their errors, & falshoods.{n}And albeit at the first he was very loth, yet at length my friendly admonition, & the common love of his countrey prevailed with him so farre, that he compiled this briefe commentary, taking his proofes, not out of the vaine fables of the people, but from his owne experience, and many other mens also of sufficient credit.{n}Now, he that undertooke this matter at my procurement, did againe as it were by his owne authority chalenge at my hands, that I should in two or three words at least, make a preface unto his booke ; thinking it might gaine some credit, and authority thereby. Wherfore to speake my minde in a word : for my part, I judge him to have taken both honest & necessary paines, who hath done his indevour not onely to weigh the divers opinions of wrighters concerning things un-knowen, and to examine them by the censure of trueth, and experience, but also to defend his countrey from the venemous bitings of certaine sycophants. It is thy part therefore (gentle reader) to accept this small treatise of his, being as it were guarded with the sacred love of truth, and of his countrey, against the perversnes of carpers. Farewel. Anno 1592. Julii 29.{n}Here beginneth the Commentary of Island.{n}Ven as in war, dayly experience teacheth us, that some upon no just & lawful grounds (being egged on by ambition, envie, and covetise) are induced to follow the armie, and on the contrary side, that others{n}arme themselves upon just and necessary causes: namely such as go to battell for the defence and propagation of the Gospel, or such as being any way provoked thereunto, doe withstand present violence and wrong, or at least (not being provoked) by reason of the enemie approching are constrained to be up in armes : right so, they that fight under Apolloes banner. Amongst whom, a great part, not upon any honest, philosophical, or indeede Christian intention, addresse themselves to wright: especially such as for desire of glory, for envy{n}and spight, or upon malicious and affected ignorance, carpe at others: and, that they may be accompted superiours, sometimes whette their stiles against the person, name and fame of this or that particular man, sometimes inveighing against a whole countrey, and by shamelesse untrueths disgracing innocent nations and people. Againe, others of an ingenuous minde, doe by great industry, search and bring to light things  profitable: namely, they that write of Divinity, Philo-{n}sophy, History and such like: and they who (taking use and experience for their guides) in the said Sciences have brought things obscure to light, things maimed to perfection, and things confused to order: and they that have faithfully commended to everlasting posteritie, the stories of the whole world : that by their infinite labours have advaunced the knowledge of tongues: to be short, that endevour themselves to represse the insolencie, confute the slanders, and withstand the unjust violence of others, against themselves, their Nation or their Countrey:{n}And I for my part, having scarce attained the sight of good letters, and being the meanest of all the followers of Minerva (that I may freely acknowledge mine owne wants) can do no lesse then become one of their number, who have applied themselves to ridde their countrey from dishonor, to avouch the trueth, and to shake off the yoke of railers & revilers. My estate enabled me onely to write; howbeit the excellencie of trueth, and the in-bred affection I beare to my countrey enforceth me to do the best I can: sithens it hath pleased some strangers by false rumours to deface, and by manifolde reproches to injurie my sayd countrey, making it a by-word, and a laughing-stocke to all other nations. To meet with whose insolencie and false accusations, as also to detect the errours of certeine writers concerning this Hand, unto good and well affected men (for the common people will be alwayes like themselves, stub-burnly mainteining that which is false and foolish, neither 96{n}can I hope to remoove them from this accustomed and stale opinion) I have penned the treatise following.{n}And albeit Island is not destitute of many excellent men, who, both in age, wit, and learning, are by many degrees my superiors, and therefore more fit to take the defence of the countrey into their hands : notwithstanding, being earnestly perswaded thereunto, by that godly & famous man Gudbrandus Thorlacius Bishop of Hola in Island, I thought good (to the utmost of mine ability) to be no whit wanting unto the common cause: both that I might obey his most reasonable request, and also that I might encourage other of my countreymen, who have bene better trained up in good learning, and indued with a greater measure of knowledge then I my selfe, to the defence of this our nation : so farre am I from hindering any man to undertake the like enterprise.{n}But to returne to the matter, because they (whatsoever they be) that reproch and maligne our nation, make their boast that they use the testimonies of writers : we are seriously to consider, what things, and how true, writers have reported of Island, to the end that if they have given (perhaps) any occasion to others of inveying against us, their errours being layd open (for I will not speake more sharpely) all the world may see how justly they do reproch us. And albeit I nothing doubt to examine some ancient writers of this Hand, by the rule of trueth and experience: yet (otherwise) their memory is precious in our eyes, their dignity reverend, their learning to be had in honour, and their zeale and affection towards the whole common wealth of learned men, highly to be commended: but as for novices (if there be any such writers or rather pasquilles) when they shall heare and know truer matters concerning Island, then they themselves have written, they shall seeme by their inconstancie and perverse wit to have gained nought else but a blacke marke of envy and reproch.{n}And that this commentarie of mine may have some order, it shall be divided into two generail parts : the{n}iv	97	G{n}first of the Hand, the second of the inhabitants : and of these two but so far-foorth as those writers which are come to our hands have left recorded : because I am not determined to wander out of these lists, or to handle more then these things and some other which perteine unto them. For I professe not my selfe an Historiographer, or Geographer, but onely a Disputer. Wherefore omitting a longer Preface, let us come to the first part concerning the situation, the name, miracles, and certaine other adjuncts of this Hand.{n}The first section.{n}The Isle of Island being severed from other countreys an infinite distance, standeth farre into the Ocean, and is scarse knowen unto Sailers.{n}ALbeit a discourse of those things which concerne the land, and the adjuncts or properties thereof be of little moment to defend the nation or inhabitants from the biting of slanderers, yet seemeth it in no case to be omitted, but to be intreated of in the first place, that the friendly reader perceiving how truely those writers of Island have reported in this respect, may thereby also easily judge what credit is to be given unto them in other matters which they have left written concerning the inhabitants, and which others have received from them as oracles, from whence (as they say) they have borrowed scoffes and taunts against our nation.{n}First therefore, that the distance of Island from other  countreys is not infinite, nor indeed so great as men commonly imagine, it might easily be provided, if one did but in some sort know the true longitude & latitude of the said Hand. For I am of opinion that it cannot exactly be knowen any other way then this, whenas it is manifest how the Mariners course (be it never so direct, as they suppose) doth at all times swerve. In ye meane while therfore I will set downe divers opinions of authors, concerning ye situation of Island, that from hence every man may gather that of the distance which 98{n}seemeth most probable; until perhaps my selfe being one day taught by mine owne experience, may, if not intrude, yet at least adjoin, what I shal thinke true as{n}touching this matter.

Island but two dayes sailing distant from Faar-lslands, y from the desert shores of Norway.{n}There be others also, who either in their maps, or writings have noted the situation of Island : notwithstanding it is to no purpose to set downe any more of their opinions, because the more you have, the more contrary shall you finde them. For my part, albeit I have probable conjectures perswading me not to beleeve any of the former opinions, concerning the situation of Island, but to dissent from them all: yet had I rather leave the matter in suspense then affirme an uncerteinty, untill (as I have sayd) I may be able perhappes one day not to gesse at the matter, but to bring forth mine owne observation, and experience.{n}A certeine writer hath put downe the distance betweene the mouth of Elbe & Batzende in the South part of Island to be 400 leagues : from whence if you shall account the difference of longitude to the meridian of Hamburgh, Island must have none of the forenamed longitudes in that place. I am able to proove by three sundry voyages of certaine Hamburgers, that it is but seven dayes sailing from Island to Hamburgh. Besides all those Islands, which by reason of the abundance of sheepe, are called Fareyiar, or more rightly Faareyiar, as likewise the desert shores of Norway, are distant from us but two dayes sailing. We have foure dayes sailing into habitable Gronland: and almost in the same quantitie of time we passe over to the province of Norway, called Stad, lying betweene the townes of Nidrosia or Trondon, and Bergen, as we finde in the ancient records of these nations.{n}100{n}In this Hand, at the Summer solstitium, the Sun passing thorow the signe of Cancer, there is no night, and therefore at the Winter solstitium there is no day. Also : Vadianus. But in that Hand, which farre within the arctic circle is seated in the maine Ocean, at this day called Island, and next unto the lands of the frozen sea, which they call Engrontland, there be many moneths in the yere without nights.{n}AT the solstitium of winter, that there is no day (that is to say, no time, wherein the Sunne is seene above the horizon) we confesse to be true onely in that angle of Island (if there be any such angle) where the pole is elevated full 67 degrees. But at Holen (which is the bishops seat for the North part of Island, and lieth in a most deepe valley) the latitude is about 65 degrees and 44 minutes, as I am enformed by the reverend father, Gudbrand, bishop of that place : and yet there, the shortest day in all the yere is at least two houres long, and in South-Island longer, as it appeareth by the tables of Mathematicians. Heerehence it is manifest, first that Island is not situate beyond the arctic circle : secondly, that in Island there are not wanting in Summer solstitium many nights, nor in Winter solstitium many dayes.{n}The third section.{n}It is named of the ice which continually cleaveth unto the North part thereof. Another writeth : From the West part of Norway there lieth an Hand which is named of the ice, environed with an huge sea, and being a countrey of ancient habitation, &c. Zieglerus. This is Thyle, whereof most of the ancient writers have made mention.{n}IT is named of ice, &c. Island hath beene called by three names, one after another. For one Naddocus a Noruagian borne, who is thought to be the first 101{n}Olaus Magnus and others.{n} Island is not within the circle arctic.{n}Saxo.{n}Islandfirst discovered by Naddocus in a tempest.{n}Discoverer of the same, as he was sailing towards the Faar-Ilands, through a violent tempest did by chance arrive at the East shore of Island; where staying with his whole company certaine weeks, he beheld abundance of snow covering the tops of the mountaines, and there-Sneland. upon, in regard of the snow, called this Hand Sneland.{n}After him one Gardarus, being mooved thereunto by the report which Naddocus gave out concerning Island, went to seeke the sayd Hand ; who, when he had found Gardasholme. it, called it after his owne name Gardars-holme, that is to say, Gardars lie. There were more also desirous to visit this new land. For after the two former, a certaine Island. third Noruagian, called Flok, went into Island, and named it of the ice, wherewith he saw it environed.{n}Of ancient habitation, &c. I gather not this opinion out of these wordes of Saxo (as some men do) that Island hath bene inhabited from the beginning, or (to speake in one word) that the people of Island were autochthones, that is, earth-bred, or bred out of their owne soile like unto trees and herbs; sithens it is evident, that this Island scarse began to be inhabited no longer agoe then about 718 yeres since.{n}This is Thyle, &c. Grammarians wrangle about this name, and as yet the controversie is not decided. Which notwithstanding, 1 thinke might easily grow to composition, if men would understand that this Hand was first inhabited about the yeere of our Lord 874. Un-lesse some man will say that Thule King of Aegypt (who, as it is thought, gave this name thereunto) passed so farre unto an Hand, which was at that time untilled, and destitute of inhabitants. Againe, if any man will denie this, he may for all me, that it may seeme to be but a dreame, while they are distracted into so many contrary opinions. One affirmes that it is Island: another, that it is a certeine Hand, where trees beare fruit twise in a yeere: the third, that it is one of the Orcades, or the last Hand of the Scotish dominion, as Johannes Myritius and others, calling it by the name of Thylensey, which{n}102{n}Virgil also seemeth to have meant by his ultima Thyle. If beyond the Britans (by which name the English men and Scots onely at this day are called) he imagined none other nation to inhabit. Which is evident out of that verse of Virgil in his first Eclogue:{n}And Britans whole from all the world divided.{n}The fourth writeth, that it is one of the Faar-Ilands: the fift, that it is Telemark in Norway: the sixt, that it is Schrichfinnia.{n}Which continually cleaveth to the North part of the Hand. That clause that ice continually cleaveth &c. or as Munster affirmeth a little after, that it cleaveth for the space of eight whole moneths, are neither of them both true, when as for the most part the ice is thawed . in the moneth of April or May, and is driven towards the West: neither doth it returne before Januarie or aiways to the Februarie, nay often times it commeth later. What West. if a man should recken up many yeeres, wherein ice (the No ice at all sharpe scourge of this our nation) hath not at all Jeres in bene seene about Island? which was found to be true lsland-this present yeere 1592. Heereupon it is manifest how truely Frisius hath written that navigation to this Hand lieth open onely for foure moneths in a yeere, and no longer, by reason of the ice and colde, whereby the passage is shut up, when as English ships every yere, sometimes in March, sometimes in April, and some of them in May; the Germans and Danes, in May and June, doe usually returne unto us, and some of them depart not againe from hence till August. But the last Navigation yere, being 1591, there lay a certeine shippe of Germanie laden with Copper within the haven or Vopnafiord in the till the midst coast of Island about fourteene dayes in the moneth of of November. November, which time being expired, she fortunately set saile. Wherefore, seeing that ice, neither continually, nor yet eight moneths cleaveth unto Island, Munster and Frisius are much deceived.{n}[The fourth{n}103{n}Island 144{n}Germaine miles in compasse.{n}The fourth section.{n}The Hand is so great that it conteineth many people. Item Zieglerus sayth: The situation of the Hand is extended betweene the South and the North almost 200 leagues in length.{n}SO great, &c. One Wilstenius schoolemaster of Oldenburg, in the yere 1591, sent unto mine Uncle in West-Island, a short treatise which he had gathered out of the fragments of sundrie writers, concerning Island. Where we found thus written: Island is twise as great as Sicilie, &c. But Sicilie, according to Munster, hath 150 Germaine miles in compasse. As for the circuit of our Hand, although it be not exactly knowen unto us, yet the ancient, constant, and received opinion of the inhabitants accounteth it 144 leagues; namely by the 12 promontories of Island, which are commonly knowen, being distant one from another 12 leagues or thereabout, which two numbers being multiplied, produce the whole summe.{n}Many people. &c. One Gysserus about the yere of our Lord 1090, being bishop of Schalholten in Island, caused all the husbandmen, or countreymen of the Hand, who, in regard of their possessions were bound to pay tribute to the king, to be numbred (omitting the poorer sort with women, and the meaner sort of the com-munalty) and he found in the East part of Island 700, in the South part 1000, in the West part 1100, in the North part 1200, to the number of 4000 inhabitants paying tribute. Now if any man will trie, he shall finde that more then halfe the Hand was at that time unpeopled.{n}104{n}The Hand, most part thereof, is mountainous and un- M^ster-tilled. But that part which is plaine doth greatly ziHerus abound with fodder, which is so ranke, that they are * faine to drive their cattell from the pasture, least they surfet or be choaked.{n}THat danger of surfetting or choaking was never heard tell of, in our fathers, grandfathers, greatgrandfathers or any of our predecessours dayes, be they never so ancient.{n}The sixth section.{n}There be in this Hand mountaines lift up to the skies, ^^ria' whose tops being white with perpetuali snowe, their ' roots boile with everlasting fire. The first is towards the West, called Hecla : the other the mountaine of the crosse: and the third Helga. Item :• Zieglerus. The rocke or promontorie of Hecla boileth with continuall fire. Item: Saxo. There is in this Hand also a mountaine, which resembling the starrie firmament, with perpetuali flashings of fire, con-tinueth alwayes burning, by uncessant belching out of flames.{n}MUnster and Frisius being about to report the woonders of Island doe presently stumble, as it were, upon the thresholde, to the great inconvenience of them both. For that which they heere affirme of mount Hecla, although it hath some shew of trueth: notwithstanding concerning the other two mountaines, that they should burne with perpetuali fire, it is a manifest errour. For there are no such mountaines to be found in Island, nor yet any thing els (so farre foorth as wee can imagine) which might minister occasion of so great an errour unto writers. Howbeit there was seene (yet very lately) in the yeere 1581 out of a certaine mountaine of South{n}105{n}Island lying neere the Sea, and covered over with con-tinuall snow and frost, a marveilous eruption of smoake and fire, casting up abundance of stones and ashes. But this mountaine is farre from the other three, which the sayd authours doe mention. Howbeit, suppose that these things be true which they report of firie moun-taines: is it possible therefore that they should seeme strange, or monstrous, whenas they proceed from natural causes? What? Doe they any whit prevaile to establish that opinion concerning the hell of Island, which followeth next after in Munster, Ziegler, and Frisius? For my part, I thinke it no way tollerable, that men should abuse these, and the like miracles of nature, to avouch absurdities, or, that they should with a kinde of impietie woonder at them, as at matters impossible. As though in these kindes of inflammations, there did not concurre causes of sufficient force for the same purpose. There is in the rootes of these mountaines a matter most apt to be set on fire, comming so neere as it doeth to the nature of brimstone and pitch. There is ayer also, which insinuating it selfe by passages, and holes, into the very bowels of the earth, doeth puffe up the nourishment of so huge a fire, together with Salt-peter, by which puffing (as it were with certeine bellowes) a Threenaturall most ardent flame is kindled. For, all these thus con-causes of fine curring} fire hath those three things, which necessarily moun in s. mahe it burne, that is to say, matter, motion, and force of making passage: matter which is fattie and moyst, and therefore nourisheth lasting flames: motion which the ayer doeth performe, being admitted into the caves of the earth: force of making passage, and that the invincible might of fire it selfe (which can not be without inspiration of ayre, and can not but breake foorth with an incredible strength) doeth bring to passe: and so (even as in undermining trenches, and engines or great warrelike ordinance, huge yron bullets are cast foorth with monstrous roaring, and cracking, by the force of kindled Brimstone, and Salt-peeter, whereof Gunne-{n}106{n}powder is compounded) chingle and great stones being skorched in that fiery gulfe, as it were in a furnace,  together with abundance of sande and ashes, are vomitted up and discharged, and that for the most part not without an earthquake: which, if it commeth from the depth of the earth, (being called by Possidonius, Succussio) it must either be an opening or a quaking. Opening causeth the earth in some places to gape, and fall a sunder. By quaking the earth is heaved up and swelleth, and sometimes (as Plinie saith) casteth out huge Lib- 2O- caPheaps: such an earth-quake was the same which I even 20-now mentioned, which in the yere 1581 did so sore trouble the South shore of Island. And this kinde of earth-quake is most clearkely described by Pontanus in these verses:{n}The stirring breath runnes on with stealing steppes, urged now up, and now enforced downe :{n}For freedome eke tries all, it skips, it leaps, to ridde it selfe from uncouth dungeon. Then quakes the earth as it would burst anon, The earth yquakes, and walled cities quiver, Strong quarries cracke, and stones from hilles doe shiver.{n}I thought good to adde these things, not that I suppose any man to be ignorant thereof: but least other men should thinke that we are ignorant, and therefore that we will runne after their fables, which they do from hence establish. But yet there is somewhat more in these three fained mountaines of Island, which causeth the sayd writers not a little to woonder, namely whereas they say that their foundations are alwayes burning, and yet for all that, their toppes be never destitute of snowe. Howbeit, it beseemeth not the authority and learning of such great clearks to marveile at this, who can not but well know the flames of mount Aetna, which (according to Plinie) being full of snowe all Winter, notwithstanding (as the same man witnesseth) it doth alwayes burne.{n}107{n}Wherefore, if we will give credit unto them, even this mountaine also, sithens it is covered with snowe, and yet burneth, must be a prison of uncleane soules : which thing they have not doubted to ascribe unto Hecla, in regard of the frozen top, and the firie bottome. And it is no marveile that fire lurking so deepe in the roots of a mountaine, and never breaking forth except it be very seidome, should not be able continually to melt the snowe covering the toppe of the sayd mountaine. Cardanus. For in Caira (or Capira) also, the highest toppes of the mountaine are sayd continually to be white with snowe : and those in Veragua likewise, which are five miles high, and never without snowe, being distant notwithstanding but onely 10 degrees from the equi-noctiall. We have heard that either of the forsayd Provinces standeth neere unto Paria. What, if in Teneriffa (which is one of the Canarie or fortunate Hands) the Pike so called, arising into the ayre, according to Munster, eight or nine Germaine miles in height, and continually flaming like Aetna : yet (as Benzo an Italian, and Historiographer of the West Indies witnesseth) is it not able to melt the girdle of snowe embracing the middest thereof. Which thing, what reason have we more to admire in the mountaine of Hecla ? And thus much briefly concerning firie mountaines.{n}Now that also is to be amended, whereas they write that these mountaines are lifted up even unto the skies. For they have no extraordinarie height beyond the other mountaines of Island, but especially that third mountaine, called by Munster Helga, and by us Helgafel, that is the holy mount, standing just by a monastery of the same name, being covered with snowe, upon no part thereof in Summer time, neither deserveth it the name of an high mountaine, but rather of an humble hillocke, never yet (as I sayd in the beginning of this section) so much as once suspected of burning. Neither yet ought perpetuali snowe to be ascribed to Hecla onely, or to a few others; for Island hath very many such snowy 108{n}mountaines, all which the Cosmographer (who hath so extolled and admired these three) should not easily finde out, and reckon up in a whole yere. And that also is not to be omitted, that mount Hecla standeth not towards the West, as Munster and Ziegler have noted, but betweene the South and the East: neither is it an headland, but rather a mid-land hill.{n}Continueth alwayes burning &c. whosoever they be that have ascribed unto Hecla perpetuali belching out of flames, they are farre besides the marke : insomuch that as often as it hath bene enflamed, our countreymen have recorded it in their yerely Chronicles for a rare The chronicles accident: namely in the yeeres of Christ 1104, 1157, °fls^and-1222, 1300, 1341, 1362, and 1389 : For from that yeere we never heard of the burning of this mountaine untill the yeere 1558, which was the last breaking foorth of fire in that mountaine. In the meane time I say not that is impossible, but that the bottome of the hill may inwardly breed and nourish flames, which at certaine seasons (as hath bene heretofore observed) have burst out, and perhaps may do the like hereafter.{n}The seventh section.	{n}The flame of mount Hecla will not burne towe (which Frisius.{n}is most apt for the wieke of a candle) neither is it Munsterus. quenched with water : and by the same force that bullets are discharged out of warlike engines with us, from thence are great stones cast foorth into the aire, by reason of the mixture of colde, and fire, and brimstone. This place is thought of some to be the prison of uncleane soules. Item : Zieglerus.{n}This place is the prison of uncleane soules.{n}Will not burne towe. Where these writers should finde such matters, it is not easie to conjecture.{n}For our people are altogether ignorant of them, neither had they ever bene heard of heere among us, if they had not brought them to light. For there is no man 109{n}Speculum regale written in the Noruagian tongue.{n}Whence the fablesofIsland grew.{n}with us so rashly and fondly curious, that dareth for his life, the hill being on fire, trie any such conclusions, or (to our knowledge) that ever durst: which notwithstanding Munster affirmeth, saying : They that are desirous to contemplate the nature of so huge a fire, & for the same purpose approch unto the mountaine, are by some gulfe swallowed up alive, &c. which thing (as I sayd) is altogether unknowen unto our nation. Yet there is a booke extant, written in the ancient language of the Noruagians, wherein you may finde some miracles of earth, water, fire, and aire, &c. confusedly written, few of them true, and the most part vaine and false. Whereupon it easily appeareth that it was written long since by some that were imagined to be great wise men in the time of Popery. They called it a royall looking glasse : howbeit, in regard of the fond fables, wherewith (but for the most part under the shew of religion and piety, whereby it is more difficult to finde out the cousinage) it doeth all over swarme, it deserveth not the name of a looking glasse royall, but rather of a popular, and olde wives looking glasse. In this glasse there are found certaine figments of the burning of Hecla, not much unlike these which we now entreat of, nor any whit more grounded upon experience, and for that cause to be rejected.{n}But that I may not seeme somewhat foolehardy, for accusing this royall looking glasse of falshood (not to mention any of those things which it reporteth as lesse credible) loe heere a few things (friendly reader) which I suppose deserve no credit at all.{n}1	Of a certaine Isle in Ireland, having a church and a parish in it, the inhabitants whereof deceasing are not buried in the earth, but like living men, do continually, against some banke or wall in the Churchyard, stand bolt-upright: neither are they subject to any corruption or downefall: insomuch that any of the posteritie may there seeke for, and beholde their ancestors.{n}2	Of another Isle of Ireland, where men are not mortali.{n}IIO{n}3	Of all the earth and trees of Ireland, being of force to resist all poisons, and to kill serpents, and other venimous things, in any countrey whatsoever, by the onely vertue and presence thereof, yea even without touching.{n}4	Of a third Isle of Ireland, that the one halfe thereof became an habitation of devils, but that the sayd devils have no jurisdiction over the other halfe, by reason of a Church there built, although, as the whole Isle is without inhabitants, so this part is continually destitute of a Pastor, and of divine service : and that it is so by nature.{n}5	Of a fourth Isle of Ireland floating up and downe in an huge lake, the grasse whereof is a most present remedy for all kinde of diseases, and that the Hand, at certeine seasons, especially on Sundayes, commeth to the banke of the lake, so that any man may then easily enter into it, as it were into a shippe : which notwithstanding (sayth he) destiny will not suffer any more then one to enter at a time. Furthermore, he reporteth that this Hand every seventh yere groweth fast to the banke, so that you cannot discerne it from firme land : but that into the place thereof there succeedeth another, altogether like the former, in nature, quantitie, and vertue : which, from what place it commeth, no man can tell: and that all this happeneth with a kinde of thundering.{n}6	Of the hunters of Norway who are so expert to tame wood (for so he speaketh very improperly, whereas unto wood neither life nor taming can be ascribed) that wooden pattens of eight elnes long being bound to the soles of their feet do cary them with so great celeritie even upon hie mountaines, that they cannot be outrun, either by the swiftnes of hounds and deere, or yet by the flying of birds. And that they will kill nine roes or more at one course & with one stroke of a dart.{n}These and such like, concerning Ireland, Norway, m{n}Island, Gronland, of the miracles of water, and aire, this master of fragments hath gathered together into his looking glasse : whereby, although he hath made his owne followers woonder, and the common people to be astonished, yet hath he ministred unto us nothing but occasion of laughter.{n}But let us heare Frisius. The flame of Mount Hecla (sayth he) will not burne towe (which is most apt matter for the wieke of a candle) neither is it quenched with water. But I say that this strange opinion may be confirmed by many reasons borrowed  out of your schoole of Philosophy. For the natural Philosophers doe teach, That it is common to all forcible flames to be quenched with dry things, and nourished with moiste: whereupon even blacksmithes, by sprinckling on of water, use to quicken and strengthen their fire. For (say they) when fire is more vehement, it is stirred up by colde, and nourished by moisture, both which qualities doe concurre in water. Item, water is wont to kindle skorching fires : because the moisture it selfe, which ariseth, doth prove more fattie and grosse, neither is it consumed by the smoke enclosing it, but the fire it selfe feedeth upon the whole substance thereof, whereby being made purer, and gathering round together, it becommeth then more vehement by reason of colde. And therefore also wild-fires cannot be quenched with water. Item, There be places abounding with brimstone and pitch, which burne of their owne accord, the flame wherof cannot be quenched with water. The graund Philosopher also hath affirmed, that fire is nourished by water. Arist. 3. de anim. And Plinie, in the second booke of his natural historic cap. no. And Strabo in his 7. booke. In Nympheum there proceedeth a flame out of a rocke, which is kindled with water. The same author sayth : The ashe continually flourisheth, covering a burning fountaine. And moreover that there are sudden fires at some times, even upon waters, as namely that the lake of Thrasumenus in the field of{n}IT2{n}Perugi, was all on fire, as the same Strabo witnesseth. And in the yeares 1226, and 1236, not farre from the promontorie of Islande called Reykians, a flame of fire brake forth out of the sea. Yea even upon mens bodies sudden fires have glittered : as namely, there sprang a flame from the head of Servius Tullius lying a sleepe : and also Lucius Martius in Spaine after the death of the Scipions, making an oration to his souldiers, and exhorting them to revenge, was all in a flame, as Valerius Antias doth report. Plinie in like sort maketh mention of a flame in a certaine mountaine, which, as it is kindled with water, so is it quenched with earth or haye : also of another field which burneth not the leaves of shadie trees that growe directly over it. These things being thus, it is strange that men should accompt that a wonder in Hecla onely (for I will graunt it to be, for disputation sake, when indeede there is no such matter so farre foorth as ever I could learne of any man) which is common to manie other parts or places in the world, both hilly and plaine, as well as to this.{n}And by the same force that bullets, &c. Munster Frisius. saith the like also. This mountaine when it rageth, it soundeth like dreadfull thunder, casteth forth huge stones, disgorgeth brimstone, and with the cinders that are blowen abroad, it covereth so much ground round about it, that no man can inhabite within 20. miles thereof, &c. Howbeit, they ought to have compared it with Aetna, or with other fierie mountaines, whereof I will presently make mention, seeing there is to be found in them, not onely a like accident, but in a manner the very same. Unlesse perhaps this be the difference, that flames brake seldomer out of Hecla, then out of other mountaines of the same kinde. For it hath now rested these 34. yeares full out, the last fierie breach being made in the yeare 1558. as we have before noted. And there can no such wonders be affirmed of our Hecla, but the same or greater are to be ascribed unto other burning mountaines, as it shall by and by appeare.{n}iv	113	h{n}But that brimstone should be sent foorth it is a meere fable, and never knowen unto our nation, by any experiment.{n}This place is the prison of uncleane soules. Here I am constrained to use a preface, and to crave pardon of the Reader, because, whereas in the beginning 1 propounded unto my selfe to treat of the land, and of the inhabitants distinctly by themselves, I must of neces-sitie confusedly handle certaine matters in this first part, which do properly belong unto the second. This is come to passe through the fault of these writers, who have confounded this part of the inhabitants religion concerning the opinion of hell, or of the infernali prison, with the situation & miracles of the island. Wherfore that we may come to this matter, who can but wonder, that wise men should be growen to this point, not onely to listen after, but even to follow and embrace the do tings of the rude people ? For the common sort of strangers, and the ofF-skowring of mariners (here I do except them of better judgement aswell mariners as others) hearing of this rare miracle of nature, by an inbred and natural blockishnesse are carried to this imagination of the prison of soules : and that because they see no wood nor any such fewell layed upon this fire as they have in their owne chimneys at home. And by this perswasion of the grosse multitude, the report grew strong, especially (as they are too much accustomed to banning and cursing) while one would wish to another the firie torments of this mountaine. As though elementarie, materiali, and visible fire could consume mens soules being spirituali, bodilesse, and invisible substances. And to be short, who can but woonder, why they should not faine the same prison of damned soules, aswell in mount Aetna, being no lesse famous for fires and inflamations then this ? But you will say, that Pope Gregorie fained it so to be. Therefore it is purgatorie. I am content it should be so : then there is the same trueth of this prison that there{n}114{n}is of purgatorie. But before I proceede any further  I thinke it not amisse to tell a merie tale, which was the originali and ground of this hellish opinion: namely that a ship of certaine strangers departing from Island, under full saile, a most swift pace, going directly on her course, met with another ship sailing against winde & weather, and the force of the tempest as swiftly as themselves, who hailing them of whence they were, answere was given by their governour, De Bischop van Bremen: being the second time asked whether they were bound ? he answered, Thom Heckelfeld tho, Thom Heckelfeld tho. I am affeard lest the reader at the{n}sight of these things should call for a bason : for it is such an abominable lie, that it would make a man cast his gorge to heare it. Away with it therefore to fenny frogs, for we esteeme no more of it, then of their croaking coax coax. Nay, it is so palpable that it is not worthy to be smiled at, much lesse to be refuted. But I will not trifle any longer with the fond Papists :{n}let us rather come unto our owne writers.{n}And first of all I cannot here omit a saying of that most worthie man Doctor Caspar Peucer. There is in Islande (quoth he) mount Hecla, being of as dreadfull a depth as any vaste gulfe, or as hell it selfe, which resoundeth with lamentable, & miserable yellings, that the noise of the cryers may be heard for the space of a great league round about. Great swarmes of ugly blacke Ravens and Vultures lie hoovering about this place which are thought of the inhabitantes to nestle there. The common people of that countrey are verily perswaded, that there is a descent downe into hell by this gulfe : and therefore when any battailes are foughten else where, in whatsoever part of the whole world, or any bloudie slaughters are committed, they have learned by long experience, what horrible tumults and out-cryes, what monstrous skritches are heard round about this mountaine. Who durst be so bold (most learned Sir) to bring such an incredible report to your eares ?{n}Neither hath Island any Vultures, but that second kinde of Eagles, which Plinie noted by their white tayles, and called them Pygarsi : neither are there any with us, that can beare witnesse of the foresaid spectacle : nor yet is it likely that Ravens and Eagles would nestle in that place, when as they should rather be driven from thence by fire and smoke, being things most contrarie to their nature. And yet notwithstanding for proofe of this matter, as also of a strange tumult heard within the hollow of the mountaine, they allege the experience of the inhabitants, which indeede testifieth all things to the contrarie. But whereabout should that hole or windowe of the mountaine be, by the which we may heare outcries, noyse and tumults done among them, who inhabite the most contrarie, distant, and remote places of the earth from us? Concerning which thing I would aske the author of this fable many questions, if I might but come to the knowledge of him: in the meane time I could wish that from hencefoorth he would learne to tell troth, & not presume with so impudent a face to enforme excellent Peucer, or others, of such unknowen and incredible matters.{n}But to returne to Munster, who endevouring to search out the causes of the great and strange fire of that famous hill Aetna, is it not monstrous that the very same thing which he there maketh natural, he should here imagine to be preternaturall, yea infernal ? But why do I speake of Aetna ? Let us rather consider what Munster in another place thinketh of the burning of Hecla.{n}Munsterus It is without doubt (saith he) that some mountaines Cosmographit anc[ fieids burned in old time throughout the whole ' world ’• and in this our age do burne. As for example:{n}’	' mount Hecla in Island at certaine seasons casteth abroad{n}great stones, spitteth out brimstone, and disperseth ashes, for such a distance round about, that the land cannot be inhabited within 20. miles thereof. But where mountaines do continually burne we understand that 116{n}there is no stopping of the passages, wherby they poure forth abundance of fire sometime flaming, & sometime smoaking as it were a streaming flood. But if betweene times the fire encreaseth, all secret passages being shut up, the inner parts of the mountaine are notwithstanding enflamed. The fire in the upper part, for want of matter, somewhat abateth for the time. But when a more vehement spirite (the same, or other passages being set open again) doth with great violence breake prison, it casteth forth ashes, sand, brimstone, pumistones, lumpes resembling iron, great stones, & much other matter, not without the domage of the whole region adjoyning. Thus farre Munster. Where consider (good Reader) how he cutteth his throat with his owne sword, consider (I say) that in this place there is the very same opinion of the burning of Hecla, & the burning of Aetna, which notwithstanding in his 4. booke is very diverse, for there he is faine to run to infernali causes. A certaine fierie mountaine of West India hath farre more friendly cen-surers, & historiographers then our Hecla, who make not an infernali gulfe therof. The History of which mountain (because it is short & sweete) I will set downe, being written by Hieronimus Benzo an Italian, in his history of the new world, lib. 2. These be the words. About 35. miles distant from Leon there is a mountaine which at a great hole belcheth out such mightie balles of flames, that in the night they shine farre and neare,  above 100. miles. Some were of opinion that within it was molten gold ministring continuall matter & nourishment for the fire. Hereupon a certain Dominican Frier, determining to make trial of the matter, caused a brasse kettle, & an iron chain to be made: afterward ascending to the top of the hill with 4. other Spaniards, he letteth downe the chaine & the kettle 140. elnes into the fornace: there, by extreme heate of the fire, the kettle, & part of the chaine melted. The monke in a rage ran back to Leon, & chid the smith, because he had made the chaine far more slender then himselfe had com-{n}117{n}manded. The smith hammers out another of more substance & strength then the former. The Monke returnes to the mountains, and lets downe the chaine & the cauldron: but with the like successe that he had before. Neither did the caldron only vanish 8c melt away: but also, upon the sudden there came out of the depth a flame of fire, which had almost consumed the Frier, 8c his companions. Then they all returned so astonished, that they had small list afterward to prosecute that attempt, 8cc. What great difference is there betweene these two censures ? In a fiery hill of West India they search for gold: but in mount Hecla of Island they seeke for hel. Howbeit they wil perhaps reject this as a thing too new, 8c altogether unknowen to ancient writers. Why therefore have not writers imagined the same prison of soules to be in Chimaera an hill in Lycia (which, by report, flameth continually day and night) that is in mount Hecla of Island ? Why have they not imagined the same to be in the mountaines of Ephesus, which being touched with a burning torch, are reported to conceive so much fire, that the very stones 8c sand lying in the water are caused to burne, 8c from the which (a staffe being burnt upon them, 8c trailed after a man on the ground) there proceede whole rivers of fire, as Plinie testifieth ? Why not in Cophantrus a mountaine of Bactria, alwayes burning in the night ? Why not in the Isle of Hiera, flaming in the midst of the sea? Why not in Aeolia in old time likewise burning for certaine daies in the midst of the sea ? Why not in the field of Babylon burning in the day season? Why not in the fields of Aethiopia glittering alwaies like stars in the night? Why not in the hill of Lipara opening with a wide and bottomlesse gulfe (as Aristotle beareth record) whereunto it is dangerous to approch in the night: from whence the sound of Cymbals and the noyse of rattles, with unwonted and uncouth laughters are heard? Why not in the field of Naples, neare unto Puteoli? Why not in the Pike of Teneriffa before mentioned, like{n}118{n}Aetna continually burning and casting up stones into the aier, as Munster himselfe witnesseth ? Why not in that Aethiopian hill, which Plinie affirmeth to burne more then all the former? And to conclude, why not in the mountaine of Vesuvius, which (to the great damage of al the countrey adjoyning, & to the utter destruction of Caius Plinius prying into ye causes of so strange a fire) vomiting out flames as high as the clouds, filling the aire with great abundance of pumistones, and ashes, & with palpable darknesse intercepting the light of the sunne from al the region therabout ? I wil speake, & yet speake no more then the truth: because in deede they foresaw, that men would yeeld no credite to those things as being too well knowen, though they should have feined them to have beene the flames of hell: but they thought the burning of Hecla (the rumor whereof came more slowly to their eares) to be fitter for the establishing of this fond fable. But get ye packing, your fraud is found out: leave ofF for shame hereafter to perswade any simple man, y‘ there is a hel in mount Hecla. For nature hath taught both us & other (maugre your opinion) to acknowledge her operations in these fireworkes, not the fury of hell. But now let us examine a few more such fables of ye common people, which have so unhappily misledd our historiographers & cosmo-graphers.{n}119{n}[The eight{n}The eight section.{n}Neare unto the mountaines (the 3. fornamed Hecla 8cc.) there be three vaste holes, the depth whereof, especially at mount Hecla, cannot be discerned by any man, be he never so sharpe sighted: but there appeare to the beholders thereof certaine men at that instant plunged in, & as yet drawing their breath, who answere their friends (exhorting them with deepe sighs to returne home) that they must depart to mount Hecla : and with that, they suddenly vanish away.{n}TO confirme the former lie, of an earthly & visible hell (albeit I will easily grant that Frisius in writing these things did not entend to reproch any, but only to blaze abroad new & incredible matters) certaine idle companions knowing neither hell nor heaven have invented this fable, no lesse reprochfull then false, and more vaine 8c detestable then Sicilian scoffes. Which fellowes these writers (being otherwise men of excellent parts, and to whom learning is much indebted) have followed with an over hastie judgement.{n}But it were to be wished, that none would write Histories with so great a desire of setting foorth novelties 8c strange things, that they feare not, in that regard to broch any fabulous 8c old-wives toyes, 8c so to defile pure gold with filthy mire. But I pray you, how might those drowned men be swimming in the infernal lake, 8c yet for al that, parleing with their acquaintance 8c friends ? What ? Will you conjure, 8c raise up unto us from death to life old Orpheus conferring with his wife Euridice (drawen backe againe down to the Stigian flood) 8c in these parts of the world, as it were by the bankes of snowey Tanais, 8c Hebrus descanting upon his harpe? But in very deed although others will not acknowledge the falshood, 8c vanity of these trifles, yet Cardane being a diligent considerer of all things in his 18. booke de subtilitate, doth acknowledge 8c find them{n}120{n}out. Whose words be these. There is Hecla a mountaine in Island, which burneth like unto /Etna at certain seasons, & hereupon the common people have conceived an opinion this long time, that soules are there purged: some, least they should seeme liars, heape up more vanities to this fable, that it may appeare to be probable, & agreeable to reason. But what be those vanities ? namely, they feine certaine ghosts answering them, that they are going to mount Hecla : as the same Cardane saith. And further he addeth. Neither in Island only, but every where (albeit seidome) such things come to passe. And then he tels this storie following of a man-killing spright. There was (saith he) solemnized this last yeare the funerali of a common citizen, in the gate neare unto the great Church, by that marketplace, which in regard of the abundance of herbs, in our toong hath the name of the herbmarket. There meets with me one of mine acquaintance : I (according to the custome of Phisitians) presently aske of what disease the man died ? he giveth me answere that this man used to come home from his labour 3. houres within night: one night among the rest he espied an hobgoblin pursuing him: which to avoid, he ran away with al speed : but being caught by the spright, he was throwne down upon the ground. He would faine have made a shout, & was not able. At length (when the spright & he had struggled together upon the ground a good while) he was found by certain passengers, & carried home halfe dead. And when he was come to himselfe againe, being asked what was the matter, he up and tolde this strange relation. Hereupon (being utterly daunted, & discouraged, when neither by his friends, nor by Phisitians, nor by Priests, he could be perswaded, that these things were but his owne conceits, & that there was no such matter) 8. daies after he died. I heard also afterward of others which were his neighbors, that no man could more constantly affirme himselfe to be wounded of his enemy, then this man did, that he{n}121{n}was cast upon the ground by a ghost. And when some demanded what he did, after he was tumbled on the earth ? The dead man (quoth he) laying his hands to my throat, went about to strangle me : neither was there any remedy, but by defending my selfe with mine own hands. When others doubted least he might suffer these things of a living man, they asked him how he could discerne a dead man from a living ? To this, he rendered a very probable reason, saying that he seemed in handling to be like Cottum, & that he had no weight, but held him down by maine force. And presently after he addeth. In like manner as in Island, so in the desert sands of ./Egypt, Ethiopia, and India, where the sunne is hoat, the very same apparitions, the same sprights are wont to delude wayfaring men. Thus much Cardane. Yet from hence (I trow) no man will conclude as our writers of Island do, that in the places of ./Egypt, ./Ethiopia, and India, there is a prison of damned soules.{n}I thought good to write these things out of Cardane, that I may bring even the testimony of strangers on our sides, against such monstrous fables. This place of Cardane implieth these two things, namely y* apparitions of sprights are not proper to Island alone (which thing al men know, if they do not maliciously feigne themselves to be ignorant) And secondly that that conference of the dead with the living in ye gulfe of Hecla is not grounded upon any certainty, but only upon fables coined by some idle persons, being more vaine then any bubble, which the brutish common sort have used, to confirme their opinion of the tormenting of soules. And is there any man so fantasticall, that wilbe induced to beleeve these gulfes, mentioned by writers, to be any where extant, although they be never so ful of dead mens miracles? yea doubtlesse. For from hence also they say, y* reproches are justly used against our nation : namely, y* there is nothing in all the world more base, & worth-lesse then it, which conteineth hell within the bounds therof. This verely is the good that we have gotten{n}122{n}by those historiographers, who have bin so greedy to publish novelties. But this opinion, bred by the sottish-nes of the common people hath hitherto (as I hope) bene sufficiently overthrowen as a thing foolish & vaine, and as being devised for the upbrayding of our nation. Wherefore, proceede (friendly Reader) and be farther instructed in this philosophy of infernali secrets.{n}The ninth section.{n}But round about the Hand, for the space of 7. or 8. Frisius and moneths in a yere there floateth ise, making a Munster-miserable kind of mone, and not unlike to mans voice, by reason of the clashing together. The inhabitants are of opinion that in mount Hecla and in the ise, there are places wherein the soules of their countreymen are tormented.{n}NO doubt, a worthy augmentation of the history, concerning the hel of Island, shut up within the botome of one mountaine, & that no great one: yea, at some times (by fits and seasons) changing places:  namely, when it is weary of lurking at home by the fires side within ye mountaine, it delighteth to be ranging abroad, & to venter to sea, but without a ship, & to gather it selfe round into morsels of yce. Come forth, & give eare all ye y‘ wonder at this secret. Lo, I will afford these historiographers another addition of history very notable. Let them write therfore, that ye Islanders have not only hel within their jurisdiction, but also y* they enter into it willingly & wittingly, & come forth againe untouched ye very same day. How can that be ? Why : it is an ancient custome of the Island Taking of that they which inhabite neare the sea shoare do usually S™1” on the go betimes in a morning to catch Seales, even upon the ' very same ise which the historiographers make to be hel, & in the evening returne home safe and sound. Set downe also (if ye please) that the prison of the damned is kept in store by the Islanders in coffers and vessels, as we shall anon heare out of Frisius.{n}123{n}Ice fioateth not 7. or 8. moneths about Island.{n}But you had need wisely to foresee, lest ye Islanders beguile all your countries of the commendation of courage and constancy : namely, as they (for so it pleaseth your writers to report) who both can & will endure the torments of hell, & who are able to breake through & escape them, without any farther hurt: which thing is necessarily to be collected out of that, that hath bin before mentioned. And I am able to reckon up a great many of our countrimen, who in ye very act of hunting, wandring somewhat farre from the shoare (the ice being dispersed by westerne winds) & for the space of many leagues resting upon the ice, being chased with the violence of the tempest, & some whole daies & nights being tossed up & downe in the waves of ye raging sea, & so (for it followeth by good consequence out of this probleme of the historiographers) have had experi-■ence of the torments, & paines of this hell of ice. Who at the last, the weather being changed, & the winds blowing at the North, being transported again to the shoare, in this their ship of ice, have returned home in safety : some of which number are alive at this day. Wherefore let such as be desirous of newes snatch up this, & (if they please) let them frame a whole volume hereof, & adde it to their history. Neither do these vaine phantasies deserve otherwise to be handled and confuted, then with such like meriments & sportings. But to lay aside all jesting, let us returne to the matter from whence we are digressed. First of all therfore it is evident enough out of the second section, yl ice floateth not about this Hand, neither 8. nor 7. moneths in a yere : then, that this ice (although at some times by shuffling together it maketh monstrous soundings & cracklings, & againe at some times with the beating of the water, it sendeth forth an hoarse kind of murmuring) doth any thing at all resound or lament, like unto mans voice, we may in no case confesse. But wheras they say that, both in the Isle, and in mount Hecla we appoint certaine places, wherin the soules of our countrimen{n}124{n}are tormented, we utterly stand to the deniall of that: and we thanke God & our Lord Jesus Christ from the botome of our hearts (who hath delivered us from death & hell, & opened unto us the gate of the kingdome of heaven) because he hath instructed us more truely, concerning the place, whether the soules of our deceased countrimen depart, then these historiographers doe tell us. We know and maintain that the soules of ye godly are transported immediatly out of their bodily prisons, not into the Papists purgatory, nor into the Elysian fields, but into Abrahams bosome, into the hand of God, & into the heavenly paradise. We know and maintaine concerning the soules of the wicked, that they wander not into the fires & ashes of mountaines, or into visible ice, but immediatly are carried away into utter darkenesse, where is weeping & gnashing of teeth, where there is colde also, & fire not common, but far beyond our knowledge & curious disputation. Where not onely bodies, but soules also, y‘ is spirituali substances are tormented. And we do also hold, y* the Islanders are no whit nearer unto this extreame & darke prison, in regard of the situation of place, then the Germans, Danes, Frenchmen, Italians, or any other nation whatsoever. Neither is it any thing to the purpose, at all to dispute of the place or situation of this dungeon. It is sufficient for us, that (by the grace and assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whose precious blood we are redeemed) we shall never see that utter darknesse, nor feele the rest of the torments that be there. Now let us here shut up the disputation concerning the hell of Island.{n}[The tenth{n}125{n}The tenth section.{n}If any man shall take a great quantity of this ice, & shall keepe it never so warily enclosed in a coffer or vessel, it wil at that time when the ice thaweth about the Hand, utterly vanish away, so that not the least part thereof, no nor a drop of water is to be found.{n}OUrely, this was of necessity to be added: namely, Oy‘ this ice, which according to historiographers re-presenteth mans voice, & is the place of the damned, doth not as all other things in this wide world, consist of ye matter of some element. For whereas it seemeth to be a body, when indeed it is no body: (which may directly be gathered out of Frisius absurd opinion) whereas also it peirceth through hard & solide bodies, no otherwise then spirits & ghosts: therfore it remaineth, seeing it is not of an elementary nature, y‘ it must have either a spirituali, or a celestial, or an infernal matter. But y‘ it should be infernali, we can not be perswaded, because we have heard that infernali cold is farre more unsufferable then this ise, which useth to be put into a boxe with mens hands, & is not of force any whit to hurt even naked flesh, by touching therof. Nor yet will we grant it to be spirituali: for we have learned in natural Philosophy, that spiritual substances can neither be seene nor felt, & cannot have any thing taken from them: all which things do notwithstanding most manifestly agree to this ise of the Historiographers, howsoever according to them it be supernatural. Besides also, it is most true, that the very same yse being melted with the heat of the sunne, & resolved into water, upon the upper part therof, standeth fishermen in as good stead to quench their thirst, as any land-river would do, which thing can no way be ascribed to a spirituali substance. It is not therefore spirituali, nor yet infernali. Now none wilbe so bold to affirme, that it hath celestiall matter, least some man perhaps might hereupon imagine, y‘ this ise hath brought hell (which the historiographers 126{n}annexe unto it) downe from heaven together with it selfe: or that the same thing should be common unto heaven, being of one & the same matter with ise, & so that the prison of the damned may be thought to have changed places with the heavenly paradise, & all by the oversight of these Historiographers. Wherfore seeing the matter of this historicall ise is neither elementarie (as we have so often proved by this place of Frisius) neither spirituali, nor infernali, both which we have concluded evidently, in short, yet sound and substantiali reasons: nor yet celestiall matter, which, religion for-biddeth a man once to imagine: it is altogether manifest, ye according to the said historiographers, there is no such thing at all, which notwithstanding they blaze abroad with such astonishing admiration, & which we thinke to be an ordinary matter commonly seene and felt. Therefore it is, and it is not: which proposition when it shall fall out true, in the same respect, in the same part, and at the same time, then will we give credite to these frozen miracles. Now therefore the Reader may easily judge, that we need none other helpe to refute these things, but onely to shew how they disagree one with another. But it is no marvell that he, which hath once enclined himselfe to the fabulous reports of the common people, should oftentimes fall into error. There was a like strange thing invented by another concerning the sympathy or conjoining of this ise: namely, that it followeth the departure of that huge lumpe, whereof it is a part, so narrowly, & so swiftly, that a man by no diligence can observe it, by reason of the unchangeable necessitie of following. But we have oftentimes seene such a solitarie lumpe of ise remaining (after the other parts thereof were driven away) and lying upon the shore for many weekes together, without any posts or engines at all to stay it. Therefore it is plaine that these miracles of ise are grounded upon a more slippery foundation then ise it selfe.{n}127{n}Frisius. Not farre from these mountaines (the three forenamed) declining to the sea shoare, there be foure fountaines of a most contrary nature betweene themselves. The first, by reason of his continual! heat converteth into a stone any body cast into it, the former shape only still remaining. The second is extremely cold. The third is sweeter then hony, and most pleasant to quench thirst. The fourth is altogether deadly, pestilent, and full of ranke poison.{n}EVen this description of fountaines doth sufficiently declare howe impure that fountaine was, out of which the geographer drew all these miraculous stories. For he seemeth to affirme, that the three foresaid mountaines doe almost touch one another: for he ascribeth foure fountaines indifferently unto them all. Otherwise, if he had not made them stand neare together, he would have placed next unto some one of these, two of the foresaide fountaines. But neither doe these mountaines touch (being distant so many leagues a sunder) neither are there any such foure fountaines neare unto them, which, he that wil not beleeve, let him go try. But to confute these things, the very contrariety of writers is sufficient. For another concerning two fountaines gainsayth Frisius in these words. There do burst out of the same hill Hecla two fountaines, the one whereof, by reason of the cold streames, the other with intollerable heat exceedeth al the force of elements. These be Frisius his two first fountaines, saving that here is omitted the miracle of hardening bodies, being by him attributed to one of the said fountaines. But they cannot at one time breake forth, both out of the mountaine it selfe, and neare unto the mountaine.{n}But here I would willingly demaund, by what reason any of the Peripateticks can affirme, that there is some thing in nature colder then the element of water, or hotter then the element of fire. From whence (I pray 128{n}you, learned writers) proceedeth this coldnesse ? From whence commeth this heate ? Have we not learned out of your schole that water is an element most colde and somewhat moist: and in such sort most cold, that for the making of secundarie qualities, it must of necessitie be remitted, & being simple, that it cannot be applyed to the uses of mankind ? I do here deliver these Oracles of the natural Philosophers, not knowing whether they be true or false. M. John Fernelius, lib.{n}2. Phys. cap. 4. may stand for one witnesse amongst all the rest, & in stead of them all. So excessive (saith he) be these foure first qualities in the foure elements, that as nothing is hotter then pure fire, & nothing lighter: so nothing is drier then earth, & nothing  heavier: and as for pure water, there is no qualitie of any medicine whatsoever exceedeth the coldnes thereof, nor the moisture of aire. Moreover, the said qualities be so extreme & surpassing in them, that they cannot be any whit encreased, but remitted they may be. I wil not heare heape up the reasons or arguments of the natural Philosophers. These writers had need be warie of one thing, lest while they too much magnifie the miracles of the fountains, they exempt them out of the number of things created, aswel as they did the ice of the Islanders. We wil prosecute in order the properties of these fountains set downe by the foresaid writers.{n}The first by reason of his continuall heat. There be Many very many Baths or hote fountains in Island, but fewer ™{n}\	11	i*i	1*1	1	1 Island.{n}vehemently hote, which we thinke ought not to make any man wonder, when as I have learned out of authors, that Germanie every where aboundeth with such hote Baths, especially neere the foot of the Alpes. The hote Baths of Baden, Gebarsvil, Calben in the duchy of Wittenberg and many other be very famous: all which Fuchsius doeth mention in his booke de Arte medendi.{n}And not onely Germanie, but also France, & beyond all the rest Italy that mother of all commodities, saith Cardan. And Aristotle reporteth, that about Epyrus{n}iv	129	1{n}these hote waters doe much abound, whereupon the place is called Pyriplegethon. And I say, these things should therefore be ye lesse admired, because the searchers of nature have as wel found out causes of the heate in waters, as of the fire in mountaines: namely, that water runneth within the earth through certaine veines of Brimstone & Allom, and from thence taketh not onely heat, but taste also, & other strange qualities. Aristotle in his booke de Mundo hath taught this. The earth (saith he) conteineth within it fountains not only of water, but also of spirite & fire: some of them flowing like rivers, doe cast foorth red hote iron: from whence also doeth flow, somtimes luke-warme water, somtimes skalding hote, and somtimes temperate. And Seneca. Empedocles thought that Baths were made hote by fire, which the earth secretly conteineth in many places, especially if the said fire bee under that ground where the water passeth. And Pontanus writeth very learnedly concerning the Baian Baths.{n}No marvell though from banke of Baian shore{n}hote Baths, or veines of skalding licour flow : For Vulcans forge incensed evermore{n}doeth teach us plaine, that heart of earth below And bowels burne, and fire enraged glow.{n}From hence the flitting flood sends smokie streames, And Baths doe boile with secret burning gleames.{n}I thought good in this place to touch that which Saxo Grammaticus the most famous historiographer of the Danes reporteth. That certaine fountains of Island do somtime encrease & flow up to the brinke: sometimes againe they fall so lowe that you can skarse discerne them to be fountains. Which kind of fountains, albeit they bee very seidome found with us, yet I will make mention of some like unto them, produced by nature in other countries, lest any man should think it somwhat strange. Plinie maketh a great recitall of these. There is one (saieth he) in the Isle of Tenedos, which at the Solstitium of sommer doth alwaies flow from the{n}130{n}third houre of the night, till the sixt. In the field of Pitinas beyond the Apennine mountaine, there is a river which in the midst of sommer alwaies encreaseth, and in winter is dried up. He maketh mention also of a very large fountaine, which every houre doeth encrease and fall. Neither is it to be omitted, that some rivers run under the ground, and after that fall againe into an open chanel: as Lycus in Asia, Erasinus in Argolica, Tigris in Mesopotamia, unto which Cardan addeth Tanais in Moscovia : and those things which were throwen into Aesculapius fountaine at Athens, were cast up againe in Phaletico. And Seneca writeth that there are certaine rivers which being let downe into some cave under ground, are withdrawen out of sight, seeming for the time to be utterly perished and taken away, and that after some distance the very same rivers returne, enjoying their former name and their course. And againe Plinie reporteth that there is a river received under ground in the field of Atinas that issueth out twentie miles from that place. All which examples and the like, should teach us that the fountaines of Island are not to be made greater wonders then the rest.{n}Doth forthwith convert into a stone any body cast into it. By these two properties, namely warmth or most vehement heat, & a vertue of hardening bodies doth Frisius describe his first fountaine. And I have heard reported (though I never had experience thereof my selfe) that there is such a fountain in Island not far from the bishops seat of Schalholt, in a village called Haukadal. Seneca reporteth of the like, saying: That there is a certain fountain which converteth wood into stone, hardening the bowels of those men which drinke thereof. And addeth further, that such fountains are to  bee found in certaine places of Italy: which thing Ovid in the 15. booke of his Metamor. ascribeth unto the river of the Cicones.{n}Water drunke out of Ciconian flood{n}131{n}Rivers of Island in summer season luke-warme.{n}Ought else therewith besprinckt, as earth or wood becommeth marble streight: a thing most strange.{n}And Cardane. Georgius Agricola affirmeth, that in the territorie of Elbogan, about the town which is named of Falcons, that the whole bodies of Pine trees are converted into stone, and which is more wonderfull, that they containe, within certaine rifts, the stone called Pyrites, or the Flint. And Domitius Brusonius re-porteth, that in the river of Silar (running by the foote of that mountain which standeth in the field of the ci tie in old time called Ursence, but now Contursia) leaves and boughs of trees change into stones, & that, not upon other mens credite, but upon his own experience, being borne & brought up in that country: which thing Plinie also avoucheth, saying, that the said stones doe shew the number of their yeeres, by the number of their Barks, or stony husks. So (if we may give credite to authors) drops of the Gothes fountain being dispersed abroad, become stones. And in Hungary, the water of Cepusius being poured into pitchers, is converted to stone. And Plinie reporteth, that wood being cast into the river of the Cicones, and into the Veline lake in the field of Pice, is enclosed in a barke of stone growing over it.{n}The second is extremely cold. As for the second fountaine, here is none to any mens knowledge so extremely cold : In deed there be very many that bee indifferently code, insomuch that (our common rivers in the Sommer time being luke-warme) wee take delight to fetch water from those coole springs. It may be that there are some farre colder in other countries: for Cardane maketh mention of a river (streaming from the top of an hill in the field of Corinth) colder then snow: and within a mile of Culma, the river called Insana seeming to be very hote is most extremely cold, &c.{n}The third is sweeter than honie. Neither is this altogether true. For there is not any fountaine with us, which may in the least respect be compared with the sweetnesse of honie. And therfore Saxo wrote more 132{n}1592. truly, saying, that certaine fountains (for there be very many) yeelding taste as good as beere: and also in the same place there are fountains & rivers not onely of divers tasts, but of divers colours.{n}And albeit natural Philosophers teach, that water naturally of it selfe hath neither taste nor smel, yet it is likely (as we have touched before, which other call per accidens) that oftentimes it representeth the qualities of that earth wherein it is engendred, and through the veines whereof it hath passage and issue: and from hence proceed the divers & sundry smels, colours and savours of all waters. Of such waters doeth Seneca make mention, whereof some provoke hunger, others make men drunken, some hurt the memory, & some helpe it, & some resemble the very qualitie and taste of wine, as that fountaine which Plinie speaketh of in the He of I” Andros, within the temple of Bachus, which in the mtrab-auscult-Nones of January used to flow over with wine. And Aristotle reporteth, that in the field of Carthage there is a fountain which yeeldeth oile, & certaine drops smelling like Cedar. Also Orcus a river of Thessalie flowing into Peneus, swimmeth aloft like oile. Cardane reporteth, that there is in Saxonie, neere unto the town of Bruns-wic, a fountaine mixed with oile : and another in Suevia neere unto the Abbey called Tergensch. Also in the valley of the mountain Jurassus. He supposeth the cause of this thing to bee very fattie pitch, which cannot but conteine oile in it. The same author saieth : It is reported that in Cardia neere to the place of Daschylus, in the white field, there is water sweeter then milke.{n}Another also neere unto the bridge which we passe over going to the towne of Valdeburg. Propertius likewise in the third booke of his Elegies mentioneth certaine waters representing the savour of wine in these words.{n}Amidst the Isle of Naxus loe, with fragrant smels and fine{n}A freshet runs ; ye Naxians goe fill cups, carouse, there’s wine.{n}133{n}This Naxus is one of the Hands called Cyclades lying in the TEgaean sea. Cardane giveth a reason hereof, namely, because Hydromel or water-hony, in long continuance will become wine. Aristotle nameth a fountaine in Sicilia, which the inhabitants use in stead of vineger. The same author maketh the cause of savours in water to be heate, because the earth being hote changeth and giveth savour unto the water.{n}Now concerning the colours of water so saieth Cardane. There is the same reason (saith he) of the colours of water, that there is of the savours thereof, for both have their originali from the earth. For there is white water within two miles of Glauca a town in Misena: red water in Radera a river of Misena not farre from Radeburg.: & in old time neere unto Joppa in Judea: greene water in the mountaine of Carpathus by Neusola : skie-coloured or blue water betweene the mountains  of Feltrius & Tarvisius : & it is reported that there was water of that colour in Thermopylis : cole-blacke water in Alera a river of Saxonie, at that place where it dis-chargeth it self into the Weser. The causes of these colours are the colours of the soile. Also Aristotle saieth, that about the promontorie of Japigia, there is a fountaine which streameth blood : adding moreover, that Mariners are driven farre from that place of the sea, by reason of the extreme stench thereof. Furthermore, they say that in Idumaea there is a fountaine which changeth color foure times in a yeere : for somtimes it is greene, somtime white, somtime bloodie, & somtimes muddy coloured.{n}Concerning the smels of waters, thus writeth Cardane. There is the like reason of difference in smels. But for the most part the steames of waters bee unpleasant, because the earth doeth seidome times smel well. The water of the river Anigris in Aelis stanke, to the destruction, not onely of fishes, but also of men. About Meton in Messania, out of a certaine pond there hath bene drawen most sweet smelling, and odoriferous water.{n}J34{n}I doe recite all these examples to the end that no man should make a greater wonder at the colours, smels, and savours of waters that be in Island, then at those which are in other countreis.{n}The fourth is altogether deadly. Isidore affirmeth, that there is a certaine fountaine whose water being drunke, extinguisheth life. And Plinie saieth, That about Nonaris in Arcadia, the river of Styx (neere the mountaine of Cillene, saieth Cardane : it would be contained in nothing but an horse-hoofe : and it is reported that Alexander the great was poisoned therewithal) not differing from other water, neither in smell nor colour, being drunke, is present death. In Berosus an hill of The same the people called Tauri, there are three fountains, every Author saieth. one of them deadly without remedy, & yet without griefe. And (which is the strangest thing of all the rest) Seneca maketh mention of a poole, into which whosoever looke, do presently die. But, as for this fourth fountaine of Frisius, which Saxo doeth likewise mention, we Islanders, as alwayes heretofore, so even at this day do testifie, that it is utterly unknowen unto us: and therefore in this regard, we render unto God im- Island free mortali thanks, because he hath vouchsafed to preserve our nation from such fountains, from serpents and venemous wormes, & from al other pestiferous & con- beasts. tagious creatures.{n}Furthermore about the foresaid mountains there is such abundance of brimstone. The three mountains called by Munster and Frisius, Fierie mountains, do all of them stand an huge distance from our Mines. Wherefore, when as neere unto these hils they have found out a place for foure fountains, which they doe so mightily extoll for wonders, they must needs have some Brimstone Mines also, standing a like distance from the said fountaines. And assuredly, neither about mount Hecla, as Munster would have it, nor by Frisius his fountaines (the report whereof how true it is, hath bene hitherto declared) is Brimstone digged up at this{n}135{n}Mines onely in the North part of Island.{n}Abundance offish about Island diminished.{n}day: nor I thinke ever was within the remembrance of our fathers. Neither is it true that Munster re-porteth concerning the abundance of Brimstone : namely, that it is almost the onely merchandize and tribute of the Hand. For whereas the Hand is devided into foure partes, the fourth part onely towards the North (nay, but even the halfe thereof) doeth use it for merchandize, and there is not one crumme of Brimstone paied for tribute of the Hand.{n}The twelfth Section.{n}There are so great store of fishes in this Hand, that they are laid foorth on piles to be sold in the open aire, as high as the tops of houses.{n}IN the open aire. In deed we have seen other country merchants doe so, until they had unladen their ships of outlandish wares, & filled them againe with fishes & with other of our countrey merchandize. But whether our men have done the like at any time, it is not manifest. Certainly, that plentifull and ancient abundance of fish is now decaied, and the Islanders now begin to be pinched with the want of these and other good things, the Lord laying the just scourge of our im-pietie upon us, which I pray God we may duely acknowledge.{n}The thirteenth Section.{n}They have most swift horses, which wil run without ceasing a continual course for the space of 30. leagues.{n}A Certaine Cosmographer in his Map of Island re-porteth concerning the horses of one parish, that they will run 20. leagues at once in a continued race. But we account both to bee impossible. For Munster writeth that those beasts which excell all other in swift-nesse & strength of body, called II Rangiferi, cannot run above 30. leagues in 24. houres.{n}136{n}There be seen sometimes neere unto Island huge Whales Munster. like unto mountains, which overturne ships, unlesse they be terrified away with the sound of trumpets, or beguiled with round and emptie vessels, which  they delight to tosse up and downe. It sometimes falleth out that Mariners thinking these Whales to be Hands, and casting out ankers upon their backs, are often in danger of drowning. They are called in their tongue Trollwal Tuffelwalen, that is to say, the devilish Whale.{n}Like unto mountains. Loe here once againe (gentle Reader) Munsters falsifying eccho, and (as the pro-verbe saieth) his blind dreame. Such a false and sence-lesse over-reaching doeth exceedingly disgrace an historic, and that by so much the more, by how much the lesse necessary it is. For to what purpose should an Historiographer make leasings, if history be a report of plaine trueth ? Why should he use such strange surmountings ? What is it that he would perswade, or whither would he ravish the Reader, if he propoundeth unto himselfe nothing but the simple declaration of things ?{n}Poets and Painters had leave of old, To feigne, to blaze, in all things to be bold. But not Historiographers.{n}The backs of Whales which they thinke to be Hands. This fable, like all the rest, was bred of an old, ridiculous and vaine tale, the credite and trueth whereof is not woorth a strawe. And it is this that foloweth, namely, that the bishop of Breme (called by the ancient Norwaies Brandan, and by Kranzius, if I be not deceived, Alebran-dus) in old time sent certaine Legates with a Coven of Friers to preach and publish in the North the popish faith, which was then thought to bee Christian : and when they had spent a long journey in sailing towards the North, they came unto an Hand, and there casting{n}Certain letters sent by Bran-dan bishop of Breme, to preach Christian faith in the North.{n}137{n}their anker they went a shore, and kindled fiers (for it is very likely that the Mariners were not a litle vexed with the nipping cold which they felt at sea) and so provided victuals for the rest of their journy. But when their fires grew very hote, this Hand sanke, and suddenly vanished away, and the Mariners escaped drowning very narowly with the boate that was present. This is the foundation of the matter, but how incredible it is, I appeale to the Reader. But what ailed these Mariners, or what meant they to doe, who in a tempestuous sea, seeing a rocke before their eyes, or (as Munster saieth) a little Hand, would not rather with all diligence have avoided it for feare of running a shore and shipwracke, then to rest in such a dangerous harbour? But in what ground should the anker be fastened? for Mariners for the most part are destitute of such long cables, whereby they may let downe an anker to the bottom of the maine sea, therefore upon the backs of Whales, saith Munster. But then they had need first to bore a hole for the flouke to take hold in. O silly Mariners, that in digging cannot discern Whales flesh from lumps of earth, nor know the slippery skin of a Whale from the upper part of the ground : without doubt they are woorthy to have Munster for a Pilot. Verily in this place (as likewise before treating of the land-miracles of Island) he gathereth fruits as they say, out of Tantalus his garden, and foloweth hard after those things which will never and no where be found, while he endevoureth to proule here and there for miracles, perusing sea and land to stuffe up his history: where notwithstanding he cannot hunt out ought but feigned things.{n}But they are called in their language Trollwal. Go not farther then your skil, Munster, for I take it you cannot skill of our tongue : and therefore it may be a shame for a learned man to teach others that which he knoweth not himselfe : for such an attempt is subject to manifold errours, as we will shew by this your example.{n}138{n}For while you take in hand to schoole others, & to teach them by what name a Whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out through ignorance the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of the worde, you deliver that which is not true : for val in our language signifieth not a Whale, but chusing or choise of the verbe Eg vel, that is to say, I chuse, or I make choise, from whence val is derived, &c. But a Whale is called Hualur with us, & therefore you ought to have written Trollhualur. Neither doeth Troll signifie the devill, as you interprete it, but certaine Giants that live in mountaines. You see therefore (and no marvel) how you erre in the whole word. It is no great injurie to our language being in one word onely: because (doubtlesse) you knew not more then one.{n}Others also do offend in the same fault, for it is not to be allowed that a certaine man being about to publish a Map of Island received from Islanders themselves, had rather marre the fashion of all, or in very deed of the most names of Capes, Baies, mountaines, springs, rivers, homocks, valleis, hils & townes (because that being ignorant of our language, he was not able to read those things aright, which he received from our countreymen) he had rather (I say) deprave & corrupt them all, then learne of the Islanders themselves, which at that time, namely in the yeere 1585. lived in the universitie of Hafnia, or Copen Hagen, how every thing ought to be read and written. And we esteeme him for this his wilfull marring of our native names and words, (whereupon it came to  passe that we reading the same, could acknowledge very few to be our owne) that he is no slight offender against our tongue, otherwise retaining the pure and the ancient propertie.{n}But now we have after some sort examined most of the myracles of Island, which our writers have mentioned. Notwithstanding before we enter into any 139{n}farther matter, we thinke it good in this section to touch that which the last forenamed man (in this Map of Island, that he caused to be put forth in ye foresaid yeere under his own name) hath given out concerning two other fountains besides the former : whereof the one should die white wooll black, & the other blacke wooll white. Which thing where he received it, or Who be the whence he had it, we can by no means imagine : for Islanduh |t js not to	founj ;n our own writers, nor in ye{n}wnie's- writers of other countries. But whence soever it be, it is but a tale, & hath not one iote of trueth in it. And although it be incredible That black wooll may be died of a white colour, seeing it is affirmed by Plinie, that blacke wooll (of all other) will receive no colour: notwithstanding there is some such thing reported by Theophrastus: namely, that there is a river in Macedonia which maketh blacke sheepe white. Speculum Also, that Norway pamphlet called the Roiall lookingregale. glasse} which I mentioned before, doth attribute these fountains to Ireland, which is also called Hybernia, and not to Island. Which peradventure deceived the Reader, reading in a strange language S instead of R.{n}That likewise deserveth no better credite which another Author writeth : That there is a certaine great stone in Island which runneth up and downe the crags and clifs of mountaines by no outward force, but by the owne proper and natural motion. Hee that will beleeve this, what will he not beleeve ? For it is such a rare devise that the Epicures themselves (who yet seemed to Lucian to have fained many incredible things) I am sure never invented the like : unlesse perhaps the sayd Author doeth imagine, that a man (who is called of the Islanders by the proper name of Stein) should compasse about, and clime up certaine rockes : which although it be ridiculous to put into a story of wonders, namely, that a man should moove or walke, yet is it so to bee supposed to save the credite of the Author, that we may not more severely 140{n}1592-condemne that fable, which is so sencelesse of it selfe and not woorthy to be read.{n}They are guiltie of the same crime also who have found out ravens, pies, hares and vultures, all white in Island : for it is wel knowen that vultures come Vultures, very seidome, together with the Ise of the sea, unto beam and us, as beares also (but they seldomer then vultures) ‘^^j^drift and a certaine kind of crowes called by the Islanders ice into Island. Isakrakur. But as for white pies, hares, and ravens, Island never had any.{n}And these in a maner be the things which, in regard of our daily busines, we were able at this present to affoord, as touching the former part of our treatise, which were penned by me for this purpose (as in the beginning I did protest) that the errors of Authors concerning an unknowen land, and the affected vanitie also of some men might be disclosed, for I am not desirous to diminish any mans good name : but because I consecrated these my labours to trueth and to my countrey, I could not chuse but shew, that those things which hitherto have bene reported by many concerning our Hand deserve very litle credite : and so to addresse my selfe unto the matters folowing concerning the Inhabitants.{n}Here endeth the first part of the Commentarie.{n}Of Island the second part, concerning the Inhabitants.{n}HAving hitherto finished the miracles of Island with certaine other particulars belonging to the first part, the which while writers doe wonder at, and diversly extoll as it were the fountains of Agamemnon, yea, as things besides and against all nature, they have bene very carelesse both of trueth it selfe, & of their owne credite. Now the course of the present speach doeth admonish mee to make haste unto the other part of the treatise concerning the Inhabitants: wherein what{n}141{n}I should first say, or where I should begin, I am altogether ignorant. For there be such monstrous, and so many mocks, reproches, skoffes, and taunts of certaine men against us poore Islanders dwelling in the utmost parts of the world (and amongst these also, some things of theirs who take upon them to professe most simple trueth, namely Historiographers) insomuch, that to reckon up the particulars were nothing els but to tell the drops of the Icarian sea. But as I said in the beginning, we will not deale alike severely with all. For although Krantzius, Munsterus, Frisius & others have written many things too boldly of our nation : yet having otherwise deserved wel of learning by their monuments, they shalbe still in ye same reputation w‘ us that they are worthy of. Howbeit in the meane time, although a man would free them from the marke of slanderers, yet is it no small matter that they should  broch certaine sencelesse, impossible & ridiculous things, such as those are which we have hitherto laid downe: as also that they should record in histories prophane and horrible untrueths, some of which kind shal now immediately be discussed. As for others, whatsoever they be, who upbraid the nation of Islanders with daily reproches, they are to have that answere in a readinesse which such men deserve. In the number of whom, that scoffer is to be accounted, who by a company of rimes published in the Germane tongue, to the disgrace of our countrey, hath brought his name into everlasting ignominie.{n}Wherefore as our present businesse requireth, while we are in hand with the writings of Authors concerning this matter, although we meet with some things containing litle reproch, notwithstanding we will examine most of them, noting the errors as hitherto wee have done: in the meane time also when they shall alleage any trueth, we will in no case dissemble it. And after this maner, first we will heare Munster, Krantzius and Frisius, and others also, if there be any more, what they 142{n}have to say, rejecting that Parot and his Dutch rimes infected with fell slander, as he is woorthy, unto the last place. First therefore the sayd Authors write concerning the faith or religion of the Islanders : and secondly, of their Maners, Customes, and course of life in maner folowing.{n}The first Section.{n}Adalbert Metropolitane of Hamburg in the yeere of Krantzius in Christ 1070. saw the Islanders converted unto Christianitie: albeit, before the receiving of Christian faith, they lived according to the lawe of nature, and did not much differ from our lawe: therefore at their humble request, he appointed a certaine holy man named Islief to be their first Bishop.{n}KRantzius in these words, and Munster other where, doe seeme to attribute unto the Islanders the prerogative of Christian faith: and they should deale both beseeming themselves and the trueth, if they did not in other places deprive us of the same. For (to speake of Krantzius anone) that which Munster before reported concerning our faith or opinion about the place and situation of hell, is very farre from Christian pietie: namely to be desirous to prie into those secrets which God hath kept close unto himselfe alone, and which his pleasure is, should exceed our capacitie : for there is not any thing found in the holy Scriptures of this matter, where the place and situation of hell, or of eternall fire prepared for the devill and his angels, and so for all damned soules, is bounded or compassed about. The holy Bible (I say) assigneth no local! or bodily situation beneath the earth, or upon the earth, or in any other place of this world, to that prison of the damned: but it affirmeth that this earth shall perish, and that a new earth, and new heavens shall be created for the habitation of just and holy men, Revel. 2. 2. Pet. 3. and Esay 65. wherefore a Christian man willingly giveth over to search into such hidden secrets: and he accounteth it unlawful{n}143{n}to receive or deliver unto others, opinions (grounded upon no plaine and manifest places of Scripture) for certainties and trueths. Deut. 4. and 12. Esay 8. Matth. 27. 2. Tim. 3.{n}Further also that commendation wherewith Munster and Krantzius doe grace the Islanders, is meerly contrary to Christian religion : namely, that they make al one reckoning of their whelps and of their children. But more of this matter anone in the 7. section. So therefore Munster disagreeth with himselfe, whereas those whom he affirmeth to be Christians, afterward he maketh to be master-builders of hell. Also Krantzius and Munster both together, when as those whom they affirme to be engraffed by faith into Christ, they exempt from all sense of pietie and honesty, in that they write that their sonnes are not dearer unto them then their whelpes.{n}But to returne to the matter: In very deed we have no great thing to say concerning our religion, what, or of what sort it was when Gentilisme was first put to flight. No more (I thinke) have other Northern nations neere unto us to say concerning ye beginning of their faith. For (alas) we must needs confesse & bewaile with deepe sighes, that untill that day which shined unto us like the beginning of immortalitie, & brought unto us the pure doctrine of the gospel, our countrymen, as likewise other churches of the North, were over-spred with more then Cimmerian darkenesse. But we may justly and religiously thinke thus much, that among us and our neighbors of Norway (for I wil not range out of my bounds, nor affirme any thing of unknowen people) after heathenish idolatry was rooted out, Christian faith & religion did florish far more sincere and simple, as being lesse infected with the poison of poperie at that time, then afterward, when as the pestiferous leaven of the see of Rome being augmented, & the contagious mischiefe growing ripe, the poison thereof was dispersed through ye whole world: for, as it shal afterward appeare, Island embraced Christ many yeeres before the{n}144{n}new idolatry of the papists began to prevaile, and did sound foorth nothing but faith in God the Father, the Sonne & the holy Ghost, like unto those two most renoumed kings of Norway, who as they had one common name, so had they one common care and pro-  fession to advance the gospel of Christ. I meane Olaus The first the sonne of Thryggo, who was borne in the yeere of c1,^ian ktnS Christ 968. attaining to the kingdom of Norway in the orwa> 27. yeere of his age, and was the first, as we have heard, that offred Christ unto the Norwegians, over whom hee reigned five yeeres: and another of that name called Olaus Sanctus the sonne of Harald, who in the yeere of Christ 1013. or there about, governed with more severitie, & for the space of 17. yeeres did boldly deliver the doctrine of Christ. In the yere of Christ 1030. being unjustly slaine by wicked murtherers, he shed his blood for ye name of Christ in a town of Norway called Sticfla Stodum.{n}Our countrey also had, among many other, one man Nialus the of excellent pietie whose name was Nialus, who about the first knowne yeere of Christ 1000. lived in the village of Berthorshvol frofeuourof situate in the parish of Island called Landehum: who in also for his experience in humane affaires, for his great wisedome and sage counsell was accompted famous. For whereas in his time Island was turmoiled with many fierce mutinies, the inhabitants being in subjection to no superiour magistrate, he intermedled not in any quarels, saving that by his discreet vertue & diligence, hee set through and brought to composition a great number: hee never did nor suffered violence, but onely upon the last day of his life. So carefully avoyded he al seditions and strifes: and gave good assistance to others, who were desirous also to avoyd and escape them: neither did any man ever put in practise his counsel, but it turned to his especiall good: nor ever any did swerve therefrom, but with the danger of his life and possessions. The wordes or rather the oracles that came from him were so certaine,{n}that it was wonderful from whence any man should have iv	145	K{n}A summe oj the Islanders Religion.{n}so great and so sure forecast and counsell of things to come, as was found to be in him. Whereupon his discreet and provident wisedome joyned with counsel! became a proverbe amongst us Nials byta raden : That is to say, the counsel of Nialus: or, the thing is done, or succeedeth by Nialus his counsel: when any busines was atchieved prudently, and with admirable discretion. This man, when, for a slaughter committed by his sonne without his knowledge, he was in his owne house beset with a ioo. men, who had conspired his death, and when his enemies began on all sides to set his house on fire, seeing his ende approch, at length he brake into these words. Doubtlesse these things happen by fate, that is, by the will of God. Howbeit, I put my hope and confidence in Christ, that we (meaning his wife, and himselfe) although this our fraile body shal undergoe the corruption of death, in the fire of our enemies, yet, that it shalbe delivered from eternal flames. And so in the midst of these voyces, and in the fury of the flames, he with his wife and the manslayer his sonne, in the yere of Christ 1010. ended his life. A voyce undoubtedly full well beseeming the sonnes of God, arguing the notable comfort of his soule amidst the very pangs of death.{n}I therefore added those things to shew by what reason I was moved to thinke, that in the very beginning of Christianitie received amongst us, mens minds were not so beguiled and overwhelmed in the darkenes of errors, as of late, a little before these our times, they have bene.{n}But after the Lord God by Luther, and Luthers fellow-labourers in the vineyard of the Lord, and by his godly successours, did make the doctrine of salvation more manifest, and shaking off the heavie slothe, and thicke miste of our minds by the finger of his right hand, that is by his holy Spirit (Matth. 12. v. 28.) did plucke the eares of our hearts, and opened our eyes, that we might behold his saving health : We all, and every of us do beleeve and confesse that God is a spirit (John 4. v.{n}146{n}24.) eternal (Esay 40. v. 28.) infinite (Jere. 23. v. 24. Psal. 139. v. 7. 8. 9.) most good (Matth. 19. v. 17.) almighty (Gen. 17. 1. Revel. 1. 8.) one in being, and nature: one in providence: one in the making and governing of all things (Deut. 6. 5. Ephe. 4. 5.) But distinguished by the persons of the Godhead and their properties, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost (Matth. 28. 19. & 3. 17.) God the Father the first person of the Godhead creator of heaven and earth, and all other things (Gen. 1. v. 1. and in those that folow) the upholder & governor of all (Psa. 115. 3. Heb. 1. 3.) Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (Psal. 2, 7. and verses following) and our Father through him (Rom. 8. 15.) keeper of our soules and bodies (Luke 12. 12.) And that Jesus Christ the second person of the Godhead is the sonne of God the Father (John 1. 18. &c.) onely begotten (John 1. 29. Heb. 1. 2.) equal to his Father (1 Chro. 17. 13. Joh. 1. i.) true God (John 1. 2. &c.) foreappointed before the creation of all things (1. Pet. 1.{n}20, Revel. 13. 8. &c.) and presently after mans fall promised to be the Messias (Gene. 3. 15. &c.) published eftsoones unto the holy Patriarches, as unto Abraham (Gen. 12. 3. &c.) unto Isaac (Gen. 26. 4.) unto Jacob (Gene. 28. 14.) and confirmed by promises (Gen. 49.{n}9. Esa. 11. 1, 10.) prefigured by ye sacrifices of Moses (Lev. 1. 2. &c.) and by other types, as namely by the offering of Isaac (Gen. 22.) by the lifting up of the brasen serpent (Num. 21) by Jonas (Jonas 2. &c.) proclaimed by the testimony of the Prophets (Esa. 7. 14.) and at length in the fulnesse of time truely exhibited : true man (John 1. 14. &c. Gal. 4.) that he died for our sinnes, and was raised againe for our justification (Rom.{n}4. 25. &c.) Ascending into heaven (Acts 1. 9. &c.) and making intercession for us at the right hand of his Father without ceasing (1. John 2. 1. &c.) by his holy Spirit  (which is the thirde person of the Godhead, coequall, and consubstantial to the Father and the Sonne, Acts.{n}5. 4.) gathering the Church to himselfe by the Word, 147{n}and Sacraments (Matth. 16. 18. Rom. 10. 14. &c.) and sanctifying it to eternal life, Acts. 9. 31. &c. And that one day at the end of the world he will come from heaven (Acts 1. 11.) to judge the quicke and the dead (1. Thessal. 4. 15.) that he will render unto the wicked according to their workes, and that he wil judge them to eternal paines (Matth. 13. 42. & 25. 4.) but that he wil reward them with eternal life, who beleeve in his Name (Matth. 25. 34.) This Jesus Christ (I say) wee acknowledge to be our redeemer (Matth. 1. 21.) our head (1. Corinth. 12. 27.) and our Lord (Ephe. 4. 5.) And that wee in our holy baptisme do give, and have given our names unto him (Acts. 2. 38.) and that we are engraffed into him by baptisme (1. Corin. 12. 13.) And this we do plainely, ingenuously, freely, and willingly confesse, and witnesse : And as for all others who invent any other name in heaven given unto men by which they may be saved, we doe earnestly detest, curse, and condemne them (Acts. 4. 12.) We holde his most holy Word to be the onely rule of our salvation : And that alone (all mans devises being cast away and contemned) we propound unto our selves as an infallible rule, and level of our faith (Galat. 1. 8. Esai 29. 13. Ezech. 20.) which we conteine under the name of the olde and newe Testament (Hebr. 8.) delivered by the Prophets and Apostles (Ephe. 2. 20.) by the singular and infinite goodnesse of God, preserved ever unto this day and to be preserved hereafter alwayes in the Church (Matth. 28. last verse.{n}Psal. 71. 18. 1. Cor. 11. 26.){n}Therefore we render thankes unto our most gratious and Almighty God from our soule, and from our whole heart, because that even unto us being separated an huge distance from the rest of the body of his Church, and inhabiting the farthest parts of the world, hee would that this light graunted for the revelation of the Gentiles, and prepared before the face of all people, and in olde time favourably shewed to holy Simeon (for in Christ are all the treasures of wisedome hidden) which now doeth 148{n}enlighten and cherish with the saving beames thereof our whole nation, that hee would (I say) this light should come unto us. This in briefe (running over the very summe) is our faith, and our Religion, which by the direction of the holy Spirit, and of his Ministers in the vineyard of Christ, we have drawen and that out of the fountaines of Israel.{n}In the yeere of our Lord 1070. saw the Islanders converted unto Christ, &c.{n}IT is doubtful unto us whether in these words Kranzius would have said, that ye Islanders were first converted unto Christ in the yeere of our Lord 1070: or whether he doth not deny that they were indeed before converted, but saith that it was knowne first unto Adalbert that yeere. But whethersoever of these he affirmeth: notwithstanding the yerely records, and most auncient Chronicles of our nation testifying the contrary do make his credite to be suspected in this place, unto which records and Chronicles, whether you had rather give assent concerning our owne proper and domestical affaires, done within the bounds of our Island, or to Krantzius or any other being ignorant in the story of our countrey, I appeale, '(friendly reader) unto your owne discretion. For my part I am enforced by many reasons to agree rather unto our owne writers. For our countreymen affirme those things onely that be knowen, and in a maner domesticall: he writeth matters forreine and un-knowen : they have compiled their histories without the difiaming, disgracing or reprehending of any other nations, onely that they might assigne unto their owne acts and exploits the true time or age thereof: he hath intermedled in his historic certaine things contrary to the trueth, and that to the upbraiding of our nation being most unknowen unto him, as it shall immediatly appeare : they describe the names, yeres, order, succession of all the Bishops of Island : he mentioneth onely one, & that farre otherwise then the trueth. Furthermore,{n}149{n}The most ancient Chronicles of Island.{n}that I may make good the credite of our Coun treymen, I wil impart with strangers a fewe things which I found in our most ancient records of the conversion of Island unto Christ, and of the succession of Bishops in our Churches. Which although they be of litle moment, and not altogether worthy to be written, yet must they of necessitie bee set downe for the defence of the trueth of our affaires against Krantzius and others: Thus therefore standeth the certeintie thereof.{n}Island first	Jn the yeere of Christ 874. Island (being indeed{n}inhabited. discovered before that time, as is above mentioned) was then first of all inhabited by certaine Noruagians. Their chiefetaine was one Ingulphus from whose name the East cape of Island is called Ingulffs hoffdi. These planters are reckoned up by name in our recordes more then to the number of 400. together with those of their blood and kinred, and great families besides: neither onely is their number described, but it is also plainely set downe, what coasts, what shores, and what in-land places eche of them did occupie and inhabite, and what names the first inhabitants did give unto Streights, bayes, harboroughs, necklands, creekes, capes, rockes, cragges, mountaines, hilles, valleys, homockes, springs, floods, rivers. And to be short, what names they gave unto their graunges or houses, whereof many at this day are reteined and used. Therefore the Norwayes with their  company peopled all the habitable parts of Island now occupied by them for the space of 60. yeeres or thereabout: but they remayned Ethnickes almost a 100. yeres, except a very few which were baptised in Norwaie. But scarce a 100. yeres from their first entrance being past, presently Christian Religion began to be considered{n}Fridericus upon, namely about the yeere of our Lord 974. Which Saxo the first thing above 20. yeres together, was diversly attempted preacher of the of many not without notable rebellion : amongst the rest are mentioned two outlandish Bishops, who{n}Anno Domini with others diligently laboured in converting the Hand 981. to Christian faith: the former was one Fridericus a{n}150{n}Saxon borne, who in the yeere 981. came into Island, and behaved himselfe couragiously in the office of preaching, and prevailed so much, that in the yeere 984. Churches were used in Island.{n}But the other outlandish Bishop or preacher whom they called Thangbrandt came first into Island in the yeere 997.{n}And then after 26. yeeres consulting about Religion, -Anno Domini at length in the yeere 1000. it was decreed in a general I000‘ assembly of all the inhabitants by their whole consent, that the worship of heathenish Idoles being abandoned, they should embrace Christian Religion.{n}Againe, in the yeere 1050. it was decreed in a solemne assembly of the inhabitants, that temporali or politique lawes (the constitutions whereof being brought out of Norwaie were communicated unto the Islanders by one Ulfliot in the yeere 926.) should every where give place to the Canon or divine Lawe.{n}In the yere 1056. one Isleif went beyond the seas out of Island to be consecrated bishop of Island.{n}He came home consecrated into Island, and entred into the bishopricke of Schalholt in the yeere 1057.

And undoubtedly as touching the trueth of our histories, it is evident that Saxo Grammaticus attributeth very much unto them : whose words in his preface of Denmarke be these: Neither is the notable tes-diligence of the Thylenses (for so he calleth Islanders) fimmuofSaxo to be smothered in silence: who when as by reason	*e{n}of the native barrennes of their soile, wanting nourishments of riot, they do exercise the duties of continuall{n}151{n}sobrietie, and use to bestow all the time of their life in the knowledge of other mens exploits, they supply their want by their wit. For they esteeme it a pleasure to know, and commit unto memory the famous acts of other nations, reckoning it no lesse praiseworthy to discourse of other mens vertues, then to practise their owne.

For in either of the Bishops seats there is a free schoole founded by the liberality and pietie of that most renoumed King of Denmarke Christian the third: and afterward the sonne following the godly steppes of his most Christian father, the said Free schooles by Lord Friderick the second, our most religious King, being called up to his heavenly countrey in the yeare 1588, have beene encreased and furthered: which at this day also doe prosper and flourish by the{n}159{n}favour and authoritie of the most gracious King and our Prince, Christian the fourth, wherein the youth of our Islande being instructed in the rudiments of liberali artes, and sacred divinitie, are trained up to knowledge and true godlinesse, that from hence ministers of Churches may proceede.{n}We are come at length in the register of the Bishops of Island downe to this present day, wherein the forenamed excellent men Gudbrandus Thorlacius, and Otto Enerus, the one at Holen, and the other at Schalholt are Bishops of our Cathedrall Churches: both of which men, that it would please God long to preserve unto his Church in health and life, for the glorie of his most holy name, we all doe earnestly and with fervent prayers beseech him.{n}The second section.{n}They inhabite for the most part in caves, or hollowe places within the sides of mountaines. And againe, They have many houses and Churches built with the bones of fishes, and Whales. Againe. Many of them also to avoide the extremitie of colde, doe keepe themselves close in their caves, even as the people of Africa doe to avoyde the heate of the sunne. Also Munster sayth: Many in Island at this day build their houses with the ribbes and bones of Whales.{n}HEre the second member taketh his beginning concerning the course of life, and the manners of the inhabitants. And first of all what buildings or houses they doe use: namely according to Munster, Krantzius, Frisius &c. Holes and caves of mountaines. But although in gorgeous buildings, and such other worldly braveries there is very litle helpe to the attayning of a life truely happie : notwithstanding, wee can not in this place conceale the truth : and we plainely affirme that Cosmographers and Historiographers also doe erre in this point. For such habitations as they write to be common 160{n}unto the whole nation, are but in verie fewe places, and are either sheepe-cots for shepheards, or cottages and receptacles for fishermen at that time of the yeere onely when they goe a fishing, and the others stande in neede to watch their flocke. But for their houses themselves, and the very dwelling places of men, the Islanders have had them built from auncient time stately and sumptuously enough, according to the condition of the Countrey, with timber, stones, and turfes, untill such time as traffike and exchange of wares beganne to cease Traffike with betweene them and the Noruagians, who were wont to{n},	,	....	i r ,	Norway{n}supply them with timber, and for that cause nowe our ceaset^ houses beginne to decay : whenas neither we have woods convenient for building, not yet there are nowe a dayes, Drift«nd not as there were in olde time, trees cast upon our shores by so Plentift11 the benefite of the sea, which may in any sort relieve us : timespast. neither doe outlandish Merchants succour our necessities: whereupon many of our meanest countrey villages are much decayed from their auncient integritie, some whereof be fallen to the ground, and others bee very ruinous. Notwithstanding there be many farmes and villages which I cannot easily reckon up, the buildings whereof doe resemble that auncient excellencie, the houses being very large, both in breadth and length, and for the most part in height also. As for example: farmes or granges which conteine chambers in them, more then fiftie cubites in length, tenne in breadth, and twentie in height. And so other roomes, as a parler, a stove, a butterie, &c. answering in proportion unto the former. I could here name many of our countrie buildings both large and wide, neither ilfavoured in shewe, nor base in regarde of their workemanship and costly firmenesse or strength, with certaine Churches also, or religious houses built of timber onely, according to auncient and artificiali seemeli-nesse and beautie: as the Cathedrall Church of Holen having a bodie the five pillars whereof on both sides be foure elnes high, and about five elnes thicke, as also beames and weather-bourdes, and the rest of the roofe{n}iv	161	L{n}proportionally answering to this lower building. Our most gracious King Lord Frederick, whose memory is most sacred unto us, in the yere 1588. did most liberally bestow timber for the reedifying of this body being cast downe in the yere 1584. by an horrible tempest. But the Church it selfe doth manifestly exceed the body thereof in all quantity: also the inner part of the Church, which is commonly called the quier is somwhat lesse, both then the middle part of the Church, and also then the bodie.{n}The Church of Schalholt was farre greater as I have  heard in olde time, then this our Cathedrall, which having now beene twise burnt, is brought to a lesser scantling. Likewise there be some other Churches of our Hand, although not matching, yet resembling the auncient magnificence of these. For here the matter seemeth not to require that I should runne into a long description of these things. For as wee doe not greatly extoll our houses and buildings, so are we nothing ashamed of them: because being content with our povertie, we render unto Christ immortali prayse who despiseth not to be received of us under a base roofe, and contemneth not our temples and houses, (which Munster, Krantzius and Frisius doe not truely affirme to be built of fishes and Whales bones) more then the marble vaults, the painted walles, the square pavementes, and such like ornamentes of Churches and houses in other countries.{n}The third section.{n}Krantzius. They and their cattell use all one house, all one foode or Munsterus. victuals, all one state (here Krantzius hath it lodging.){n}Also. They live onely by feeding of cattell, and sometimes by taking of fishes.{n}THese be the things together with those that followe, which Krantzius hath champed, and put into Munsters mouth, so that Munster shall not neede so much as once to chewe them, which may appeare by comparing them both together. For Munster, as hee 162{n}swallowed these reproches, taking them out of Krantzius his preface upon Norway, so he casteth up the verie same morsels undigested and rawe against our nation, in his fourth booke of Cosmographie cap. 8. Those things which have beene hitherto, although they have sufficiently grieved us, yet will we let them seeme more tollerable: but this most malitious devise, and those which follow we cannot easily brooke. It is our part therefore in this place also to avouch the trueth, and to turne the leasing upon the authors owne head.{n}House, &c. First, that which they say concerning the same common house (as also living, and state) with our cattell, we plainely affirme to be false and erronious, not onely the truth it selfe being our witnesse, if any man would make triall, but also the experience of manie strangers, that have lived some yeeres amongst us, and have more minde to speake the trueth then to revile our nation: who have seen our houses and habitations with their owne eyes, and knewe that in every particular farme or graunge there were many severall roomes: namely, in those that were most simple and base, seven or eight: In others which were greater, sometimes tenne, and sometimes twentie. In the greatest sometimes fortie, and sometimes fiftie. Which for the most part being severed, both by roofes and walles, doe serve for the dayly and houshold affaires of one owner or master, seidome of two or three, but almost never of more: whereupon the Reader may easily judge, howe true it is that the Islanders and their cattell have all one house to lie in, when every husbandman in this varietie of roomes hath severall oxe-stalles, sheepe-cotes, stables, lambes-cots separated indifferent spaces one from another, which the servants goe unto so oft as neede requireth, and from thence returne backe to the dwelling houses.{n}But whereas one noted in his Mappe of Island, concerning the province of Skagefiord, that under the same roofe, men, dogges, swine and sheepe live all together, it is partly false, and partly no marvell: for sheepe, as 163{n}it hath beene sayde, and specially for swine (when as that province hath no swine at all) it is utterly false: for dogges it is no marvell, when as not kings courts were ever, or at this day are destitute of them, as it is well knowen to all men. But as touching dogges afterward in the seventh section.{n}Victuals, &c. Whither beasts meate may fitly be termed by the name of Victus, a man may justly doubt: when Doletus interpreting a peece of Tullie, saith: As for Victus (sayth he) wee will so expound it with the Civilians, namely that we comprehend under the word of Victus all things necessarie for the life of man, as meate, drinke, attire of the bodie, &c. And Ulpianus de verborum significatione defineth Victus in the very same words. But in this place the saide authors call beasts meate by the name of Victus.{n}But let us see what trueth and plaine dealing is to be found in these men. We have no labouring cattell besides horses and oxen: these have grasse and hay (except where haye is wanting) for their fodder, and water to drinke. Now, the very same writers confesse, that the Islanders live by fish, butter, flesh both beefe, and mutton, and corne also, though it bee scarce, and brought out of other countries. Therefore they have not the same foode with brute beasts, which notwithstanding the  sayde writers affirme in these wordes: They and their cattell use all one victuals or food. What Munsters meaning is in this clause, he himselfe a little before hath plainely taught.{n}Island (saith he) conteineth many people living onely with the food of cattell, and sometimes by taking of fishes. But what else is the food of cattell, but the meat of cattell, saith Doletus ? Unlesse perhaps Munster calleth the food of cattell, cattell themselves slaine for the foode of men: whom, as I thinke, the use of the latine tongue doth gainesay, which hath taught us that as men doe eate, so beasts doe feede, and hath termed the victuals of men, and the food or fodder of cattel.{n}164{n}But may I thinke that Munster and Krantzius were so mad as to imagine that the Islanders live upon grasse and hay ? To this passe of miserie was Nabuchodonozor brought undergoing the yoke of Gods vengeance: Daniel 4. vers. 30. We will easily graunt that beasts, and cattell will not perhaps refuse many things, which men not onely of our countrey but of yours also eate, if the saide beasts be destitute of their usuall food: as horses are fedde with corne and barley loaves: they will drinke milke also (like unto calves and lambes) and ale, if it be proffered them, and that greedily. And dogges in like manner will devour any deinty dishes whatsoever. May any man therefore say that men use the same common victuals with dogges and horses ?{n}Now, whatsoever things have happened in the time of grievous famine ought not to be recorded in historic for the general custome of any countrey. As it is not lawfull for us to write concerning other nations, that the people of this or that countrie, doe usually live by eating of dogs, mise, cats, although perhaps in the time of famine or seige or dearth of corne, they have often bene constrained so to doe.{n}But that the same drinke is some times common to many men with beasts, we will not greatly gainesay: namely most pure water, that natural drinke created by God for all living creatures: which also in some respect Phisicians doe commende, yea, neither the Patriarkes themselves, nor our saviour Christ despised it.{n}As touching apparell (for we comprehend apparell also under the name of Victus) it is no wise common to us with beasts. For nature hath clad them with haires & bristles (as I dare say Munster and Krantzius cannot be ignorant) men, being otherwise naked, stande in neede of clothes to cover their bodies. But I had not thought it might therefore have properly beene sayde, that sheepe and we have all one apparell. Men of other countries also weare cloth of sheepes wooll, although it i65{n}be more finely wrought. But no more concerning the attire of the bodie. For it is a meere folly to seeke for praise, and ambitious reputation by that, which argueth the infirmitie of our nature.{n}State, &c. Now, it remaineth that we should speake of that state, which we are sayd to have common with beasts: but of what kinde or maner it should be, or our writers would have it to be, I cannot easily discerne. State (sayth Doletus) is either of the body, or of causes, or of order and condition. Doubtlesse, that there is another state of our bodies then of beasts (for besides our two feet, we have hands also, and go with our bodies, and countenances lift upright) and that we be of another order and condition from them, we are verily perswaded. As for these good fellowes, if they know any such matter by themselves or others, let them disclose it. We doe altogether scorne these, being so vaine things, and breeding so great contempt against the Majesty of God our creator, neither do we vouchsafe them any larger discourse.{n}But because it is our duety not so highly to regard either the love of our countrey, or of any other thing whatsoever, but that we may be ready at all times, and in all places, to give trueth the preheminence: I will say in a word what that was which perhaps might minister occasion to this infamous reproch of writers.{n}There be nere unto Schalholt, upon the South shore of Island, three small parishes standing betweene two most swift rivers Thiorsaa and Olfwis Aa, being in a maner destitute both of wood and turfe, which is the accustomed fewell of the countrey. And although most of the inhabitants of these parishes, and some of their neighbours, as they doe in time of yeere provide all things necessarie for housholde, so especially those things which belong to fires and bathes: notwithstanding there be certaine among them of the basest sort of people, who, because they want those things at home, and are not able to provide them from other places, are con-166{n}1592-strained to use straw for the dressing of their meat.{n}But when the sharpe rigor of snowy Winter commeth on, these poore people betake them to their oxe stalles, & there setting up sheds, & doing their necessary busi-nesse in the day time, when they are not able to make fires, they borrow heat from their oxen, as it hath beene reported to mee by others: And so they onely, being verie fewe in number, doe not willingly enjoye, but are constrayned to use the same common house with their oxen. But for their livelihoode and state it is farre otherwise with them then with their oxen, of which thing I have entreated before. This is the lot, & povertie of certaine men in those pettie parishes, the condition  whereof is therefore made a common by-worde of the people amongst us, though somewhat injuriously. Where I would willingly demaund with what honestie men can impute that unto the whole nation, which is hard and skantly true of these fewe poore men ? I am wearie to stay any longer in this matter: onely, because I have to doe with Divines, let that of Salomon suffice, Proverbs 17. verse 5. Hee that mocketh the poore, reprocheth him that made him.{n}And in very deede, because this our nation is nowe, and heretofore hath beene poore and needie, and as it were a begger amongest many rich men, it hath susteined so many taunts and scoffes of strangers. But let them take heede whom they upbraide. Verely if there were nothing else common unto us with them, yet we both consist of the same elements, and have all one father and God.{n}167{n}[The fourth{n}The fourth section.{n}They leade their lives in holy simplicitie, not seeking any more then nature doeth afforde. A happie Nation, whose povertie no man doth envie. But the English and Danish merchants suffer not the nation to be at rest, who frequenting that countrey to transport fishing, have conveighed thither our vices, together with their manifolde wares. For nowe, they have learned to brew their water with corne, and beginne to despise, and loath the drinking of faire water. Now they covet golde and silver like unto our men.{n}Simplicitie, &c. I am exceedingly glad, that the commendation of holy simplicitie is given unto us. But it grieveth us that there is found so great a decay of justice, and good lawes, and so great want of governement amongst us, which is the cause of many thousande haynous offences : which all honest and godly men doe continually bewayle. This inconvenience doth not happen through the negligence of the highest Magistrate, that is, of our most gracious King, but rather by our owne fault: who doe not present these thinges unto his Majestie, which are disorderly committed without his knowledge, and which are wanting in the inferiour Magistrate.{n}Merchants. Moreover, Merchants, not onely of England and Denmarke, but especially of Germanie, as at this time, so heretofore frequenting our countrey, not to transport fishing, but fishes, taught not Islanders the arte of brewing corne with water. For ye Noruagians themselves, the first, to our knowledge, that inhabited this Hand, from whom ye Islanders are lineally descended, brought with them out of Norway that arte, as also golde and silver coine, so that in old time there was no lesse use of silver and golde with us, then there is at this day.{n}168{n}And it is certaine that before the often navigations Come of old of Danes, Germans, and English men unto us, our land £r0^inS was much more fertile then nowe it is (feeling the in- tn 5	'{n}conveniences of the aged and decayed worlde, both from heaven and earth) and brought foorth, in certaine choyse places, corne in abundance.{n}The fift section.{n}The King of Denmarke and Norway sendeth every yeere a Lieutenant into the Countrey.{n}IN the yeere of our Lord eight hundred fortie and sixe Harald Harfagre (which is to say, golden haires or faire clockes) was borne. Who afterward in the yeere eight hundred fiftie and eight, being chosen king of Norway, when he was growen to age, and full strength, chaunged the forme of the Noruagian government. For whereas before it was devided into pettie Provinces (which they called Fylki, and the pettie kings that The occasion governed them, Fylkis konga) he reduced it by force of armes unto a Monarchic. But when some inhabitants of the countrie, being mightie, and descended of people of Norgood parentages, could not well brooke this hard dealing, way. they chose rather to be banished their countrey, then not to shake off the yoke of tyranny. Whereupon, they in the yeere above named eight hundred seventie and foure, transported colonies into Island being before discovered by some men and found out, but unpeopled as yet: And so being the first founders of our nation, they called themselves Islanders, which name their posteritie reteineth unto this day. And therefore the Islanders lived a long time, namely, three hundred eightie and sixe yeeres, more or lesse, acknowledging no submission to any other Nation. And although Hayuinus Haquinus that crowned King of Norway, who reigned conatus. longest of any Noruagian king, namely, above sixtie sixe yeares, did oftentimes attempt by Ambassadours to make the Islanders become tributaries unto him, notwithstanding at all times they constantly withstoode him, till at{n}169{n}length about the yeere of our Lord 1260. they performed homage unto him. And afterward continued alwayes in their promised loyaltie, being subjects to the king of Norway. But now at this day, since the Empire of the Noruagians was translated by Margaret Queene of Denmarke, Suedeland, and Norway unto the Danes, they doe honour as their soveraigne Lord and King the most gracious king of Denmarke.{n}The sixt section.{n}All things are common among them except their wives.{n}HEre Krantzius in the first place beginneth with such a gybe. There be many notable things in their manners, &c. Moreover, your wit being too hastie in affirming things unknowen, doth here also deminish your credite. The experience as well of all things as of persons and times proveth your over greedie desire of noveltie, of fame and vaine-glorie, and argueth your great negligence in maintaining the truth. O worthy writers.{n}But whether the aforesayde things bee true or no, wee call the lawes of our Countrey to witnesse, which the Islanders from the beginning have used all one with the Norwayes : of the King and his subjects : of the seate of justice, and of law-cases which come to be decided there : of inheritances : of adoptions, marriages, theft, extortions, lending, bargaines, and the rest: all which, to what purpose should they be enjoyned unto them with whom all things are common ? We call to witnesse so many broyles and contentions in our courts, and places of judgement in Island concerning goods mooveable, and immooveable : we call to witnesse our kings now of Denmarke, aforetime of Norway, who by so many billes of supplication out of Island in old time, and of late have beene often interrupted, for the setting through of controversies concerning possessions. Wee call Krantzius himselfe to witnesse against himselfe, 170{n}whose words in the first section were these. Before the receiving of Christian faith the Islanders living according to the lawe of nature did not much differ from our lawe, &c. If by the lawe of nature, then doubtlesse by that lawe of justice, which giveth to every man his owne : If by the lawe of justice, then certainely distinctions of properties and possessions must needes have taken place in our Nation : and although this very lawe is often transgressed, and that haynously even in the Church : notwithstanding both the Church, and also heathen men doe acknowledge it to be most just and{n}The seventh section.{n}They make all one reckoning of their whelpes, and of their children : except that of the poorer sort you shall easier obtaine their sonne then their shalke.{n}ALthough in the beginning of this Treatise I thought that Munster and other men of great name in those things which they have left written concerning Islande, were not to bee charged with slander, yet whether that favour may here be shewed by any man whatsoever (be he never so favourable, and never so sincere) I doe not sufficiently conceive. For what should move such great men, following the despightfull lyes, and fables of mariners, to defame and staine our nation with so horrible and so shamefull a reproch ? Surely nothing else but a carelesse licentiousnesse to deride and contemne a poore and unknowen Nation, and such other like vices.{n}But, be it knowen to all men that this untrueth doth not so much hurt to the Islanders, as to the authors themselves. For in heaping up this, and a great number of others into their Histories, they cause their credite in other places also to be suspected : And hereby they gaine thus much (as Aristotle sayth) that when they speake trueth no man will beleeve them without sus-pition.{n}171{n}But attend a while (Reader) and consider with me the gravitie and wisedome of these great Clarkes : that we may not let passe such a notable commendation of Island. Krantzius and Munster have hitherto taught, that the Islanders are Christians. Also : that before the receiving of Christian faith they lived according to the lawe of nature. Also: that the Islanders lived after a law not much differing from the lawe of the Germanes. Also, that they lived in holy simplicitie.{n}Attend I say (good Reader) and consider, what markes of Christianitie, of the law of nature, of the Germanes law, of holy simplicitie, these authors require, and what markes they shew and describe in the Islanders. There was one of the sayd markes before : namely, that the Islanders doe place hell or the prison of the damned, within the gulfe and bottome of mount Hecla : concerning which, reade the first section of this part, and the seventh section of the former. The seconde marke is,  that with the Anabaptists they take away distinctions of properties and possessions : in the section next going before. The third and most excellent is this : those singular & natural affections, that love and tender care, and that fatherly and godly minde of the Islanders towards their children, namely that they make the same accompt of them, or lesse then they doe of their dogges. What ? Will Munster and Krantzius after this fashion picture out unto us the law of Christ, the lawe of nature, the lawe of the Germanes, and holy simplicitie ? O rare and excellent picture, though not altogether matching the skill of Apelles : O sharpe and wonderfull invention, if authenticall: O knowledge more then humane, though not at all divine.{n}But wee Islanders (albeit the farthest of all nations and inhabiting a frozen clime) require farre other notes of Christianitie. For we have the commaundement of God, that every man should love his neighbour as himselfe. Nowe there is none (I suppose) that doeth not love or esteeme more of himselfe then of his dogge. And if 172{n}there ought to bee so great favour, so great estimation, so great love unto our neighbour, then how great affection doe wee owe unto our children ? The most neare and inseparable love of whom, besides that nature hath most friendly setled in our mindes, the love of God also commandeth us to have speciali regard in trayning them up (Exod. 12. 24. Ephes. 6. 4.) namely, that there may be in holy marriage certaine seminaries of Gods Church, and exercises of all pietie and honestie : according to the excellent saying of the Poet.{n}God will have each family, a litle Church to be.{n}Also{n}Of humane life or mans societie, a Schole or College is holy matrimonie.{n}That it may be manifest, that among Christians their sonnes are more to be accompted of and regarded, then their dogges : and if any doe no otherwise esteeme of them, that they are no Christians.{n}But this natural affection towarde our most deare of-spring is plainely seene in the heathen themselves : that whomsoever you totally deprive of this, you denie them also to bee men. The mothers of Carthage testifie this to be true, when as in the third Punic warre the most choyse and gallant young men in all the Citie were sent as pledges into Sicilia, whom they followed unto the shippes with most miserable weeping and lamentation, and some of them being with griefe separated from their deare sonnes, when they sawe the sayles hoysed, and the shippes departing out of the haven, for very anguish cast themselves headlong into the water : as Sabellicus witnesseth. Egaeus doth testifie this, who when hee sawe the shippe of his sonne Theseus, returning out of Creete with blacke sayles, thinking that his sonne had perished, ended his life in the next waters : Sabell. lib. 3. cap. 4. Gordianus the elder, Proconsul of Affrica, doth testifie this, who likewise, upon rumors of the death of his sonne,{n}173{n}hanged himselfe. Campoful. lib. 5. cap. 7. Also Jocasta the daughter of Creon, Auctolia daughter of Simon, Anius King of the Thuscans, Orodes King of the Parthians, and an infinite number of others. Concerning whom reade Plutarch stat. lib. 2. and other authors &c. To these may be added that sentence, Love descendeth, &c. So that you see, it is no lesse proper to a man entirely to love his children, then for a bird to flie : that if our writers at any time have confessed the Islanders to be men (much lesse to be Christians,) they must, will they nill they, ascribe unto them this love and affection towardes their children : If not, they doe not onely take from them the title and dignitie of men, but also they debase them under every brute beast, which even by the instinct of nature are bound with exceeding great love, and tender affection towards their young ones.{n}I will not adde against this shamelesse untruth most notable examples of our owne countreymen : I will omit our lawes of man-stealing, more ancient then the Islanders themselves, being received from the Noruagians, and are extant in our booke of lawes under the title Manhelge cap. 5. Whosoever selleth a freeman (any man much more a sonne) unto strangers &c.{n}Now if any man be driven to that hard fortune, that he must needs commit his owne sonne into the hands of some inhabitant or stranger, being urged thereunto by famine, or any other extreame necessity, that he may not be constrained to see him hungerstarved for want of sustenance, but keepeth his dogge still for his owne eating, this man is not to be sayd, that he esteemeth equally or more basely of his sonne then of his dogge: whether Islanders or any other countreymen do the same.{n}The Germane or the Danish mariners might perhaps find amongst us certaine beggars laden with children (for we have here a great number of them) who in jesting maner for they are much given to trifling talke, might say: Give me this, or sell me that: and when the stranger 174{n}should aske, What will you give me for it ? the begger might answere : I have ten or foureteene children, I will give you some one or more of them, &c. For this rabble of beggers useth thus fondly to prate with strangers. Now if there be any well disposed man, who pitying the need and folly of these beggers, releaseth them of one sonne, and doth for Gods sake by some meanes provide for him in another countrey : doth the begger therefore (who together with his sonne being ready to die for hunger and poverty, yeeldeth and com-mitteth his sonne into the hands of a mercifull man) make lesse account of his sonne then of his dogge ? Such works of love and mercie have bene performed by many, aswell Islanders themselves as strangers: one of which number was that honourable man Accilius Julius, being sent by the most gracious King of Denmarke into Island in the yere of our Lord 1552, who, as I have heard, tooke, and carried with him into Denmarke fiftene poore boyes: where afterward it was reported unto me, that by his good meanes every one of them being bound to a severall trade, proved good and thriftie men.{n}What if some man be driven to that passe, that he doth not onely sell his sonne, but not finding a chapman, his owne selfe killeth and eateth him ? Examples of this kinde be common, namely of the unwilling and forced cruelty of parents towards their children, not being pricked on through hate, or want of natural affection, but being compelled thereunto by urgent necessity. Shall any man hereupon ground a generail reproch against a whole nation ? We reade that in the siege of Samaria, two mothers slew their sonnes, and eat them sodden : 4. King. chap. 6. We reade in the siege of Jerusalem, how lamentable the voice of that distressed mother was, being about to kill her tender childe : My sweet babe, sayth she (for I will report Eusebius owne words, concerning this matter, though very common, that the affection of a mother may appeare) borne to miserie and mishap, for whom should I conveniently reserve thee{n}175{n}in this tumult of famine, of warre, and sedition ? If we be subdued to the government of the Romans, we shall weare out our unhappy dayes under the yoke of slavery. But I thinke famine will prevent captivity. Besides, there is a rout of seditious rebels much more intollerable then either of the former miseries. Come on therefore, my sonne, be thou meat unto thy mother, a fury to these rebels, and a byword in the common life of men, which one thing onely is wanting to make up the calamities of the Jewes. These sayings being ended, she killeth her sonne, roasting and eating one halfe, and reserving the other, &c. Eusebius lib. 3. cap. 6. Now, what man will not beleeve that this unhappy mother would full gladly have passed over this her sonne into the possession of some master or chapman, if she could have happened upon any such, with whom she thought he might have beene preserved ? That famine is well knowen which oppressed Calagurium, a city of Spaine, when in olde time Cneius Pompeius layed siege thereunto (Valerius lib. 7. cap. 7.) the citizens whereof converted their wives and children into meat for the satisfying of their extreame hunger, whom doubtlesse they would with all their hearts have solde for other victuals. That famine also is well knowen which in the yere of our Lord 851 (Vincent, lib. 25. cap. 26.) afflicted Germany, insomuch that the father was glad to devoure his owne sonne. It is well knowen after the death of the Emperour Henry the seventh, in a famine continuing three whole yeres, how the parents would devoure their children, and the children their parents, and that especially in Polonia and Bohemia. And that we may not onely allege ancient examples: it is reported that there was such a grievous dearth of corne in the yeeres 1586, and 1587, thorowout Hungary, that some being compelled for want of food were faine to sell their children unto the most bloudy and barbarous enemy of Christians, and so to enthrall them to the perpetuali yoke of Turkish slavery: and some are sayd to have taken their children, whom they could no longer{n}176{n}1592. sustaine, and with cruell mercy to have cast them into Danubius, and drowned them. But should these stories and the like make any man so mad as to affirme that this or that nation accustometh to kill their children for their owne food, and to sell them willingly unto the Turks, or to drowne and strangle them willingly in the water ? I cannot thinke it. So neither (because beggers in Island being enforced through extreame and biting necessitie, do willingly part with their sonnes) is this custome generally to be imputed unto the whole nation, and that by way of disgrace, by any man, except it be such an one who hath taken his leave of all modesty, plaine dealing, humanity, and trueth.{n}But I could wish that the love of dogges in Islanders might be more sparingly reprehended by those people, whose matrons, and specially their noble women, take so great delight in dogs, that they carry them in their bosomes thorow the open streetes : I will not say in Churches: which fashion Caesar blamed in certaine strangers, whom he saw at Rome carrying about yoong apes and whelpes in their armes, asking them this question : Whether women in their countrey brought foorth children or no ? signifying heereby, that they do greatly offend, who bestow upon beasts these natural  affections, wherewith they should be invited to the love of mankinde, and specially of their owne ofspring: which strange pleasure never overtooke, nor possessed the nation of the Islanders. Wherefore now (Munster and Krantzius) you must finde us out other marks of Christianity, of the law of nature, of the Germans law, and of holy simplicity.{n}IV{n}177{n}[The eight{n}The eight section.{n}They honour their Bishop as their King : unto whose command all the whole people have respect. Whatsoever he prescribeth out of the law, the scriptures, or the customes of other nations, they do full holily observe.{n}THere was indeed at the beginning, about the time of the reformation of religion, great reverence had unto the bishop ; but never so great, that our politique lawes at the bishops command should give place to outlandish lawes & customes. Neither in the time of Albertus Krantzius, much lesse of Munster (of which two the first deceased in the yere of our Lord 1517, and the second 1552) the bishops of Island had the authority of kings, when as many of the country which were of the richer sort, would not doubt to rebel! against them ; which thing is too well knowen in our countrey. Yet in the meane time, the bishops being terrible with their authority of excommunication, reduced some under their subjection, and others at that time they cruelly persecuted.{n}Moreover, albeit at that time the bishop was had in great, yea, in exceeding great reverence, yet now adayes, the darkenesse of popery being dispelled, the devill assaulteth men after another sort, and even here amongst us, he is not slacke to arme their minds with contempt, and perverse stubburnnesse against God, and his holy ministry.{n}The ninth section.{n}They live there for the most part upon fishes, because of their great want of corne, which is brought in from the port townes of other countreys: who cary home fishes from thence with great gaine. Also Munster sayth, they do there use stockefish in stead of bread, which groweth not in that countrey.{n}Consider (friendly reader) how Munster is delighted to harpe upon one string, that when he can write nothing of an unknowen nation which may cary any 178{n}. . . . I59X shew with it, he is faine either to bring in falshood, or often to repeat the same things, & so to become tedious unto his reader: for he sayd a little before, that the Islanders live upon fish. His words above recited were these : Island conteineth many people living onely with the food of cattell, and sometimes by taking of fishes. And that I may omit the rest in which some trifle might be noted : whereas he sayeth that bread groweth not in Island : it is most true : which I thinke is common therewith to Germany also, because bread groweth not there neither, except it be in Munsters field where natural vineger also doth marveilously encrease. But these toyes, by the liberty of rethoricke forsooth, shall be out of danger. Howbeit, unto these reproches, which strangers do gather from the meats and drinks of the Islanders, we will hereafter briefly answere, Sect.{n}U-{n}The tenth section.{n}The inhabitants do celebrate the actes of their ancestours, Munsterus. and of their times, with songs, and they grave them Kranizius-in rocks and promontories, that they may not decay with posterity, but onely by the defect of nature.{n}There be divers found amongst them that be minstrels, Frisius. and can play upon the lute, who with their delectable musicke do ensnare and take both fowles and fishes.{n}WE denie not but that some woorthy actes of our The Islanders forefathers be reserved in the songs and poemes{n}of our countreymen, as also in prose : but that the same acts oftheir things have beene engraven by us, or by our ancestours, ancestors. in rocks or promontories, we may in no case acknowledge that praise to be due unto us, nor yet the other of minstrels, and taking of birds and fishes. For we holde it to be the part of an honest and ingenuous mind, as to refute false crimes, so not to challenge undeserved praise unto himselfe, nor to accept it being offered.{n}179{n}BUt now, let this be the end of our controversie with the authours aforesayd, being otherwise men of excellent learning, and of great renoume, who notwithstanding so inconsiderately have entermedled these things in their writings. And now the better part of my labour is finished.{n} But yet there remaines that viperous German brood the mother whereof would have it come to light, as it were at a second birth, without name, that it might so much the more freely wound the fame of the Islanders with venemous sting.{n}Moreover, although I be not afrayd to encounter with this beast, yet would I have all men to know with what minde I undertake this enterprise, namely, not that I meane to contend with his pestiferous rancour, by reproches, and railing speeches (for as it is in the common proverbe:{n}I know, that if I strive with dung most vile, How ere it be, my selfe I shall defile){n}but that I may satisfie all honest and well affected men, even strangers themselves, who shall hereafter reade or heare^ or have heretofore heard that Germane pasquill, least they also should thinke that we woorthily sustaine so monstrous a disgrace: and also that I may from henceforth, if it be possible, restraine others (who use those venemous Germaine rimes to the upbrading of our nation, and from hence borrow their scoffes, and re-prochfull taunts to the debasing of us Iselanders) from that libertie of backbiting.{n}Therefore, that I may not be tedious to the reader with long circumstances, I will come to the rehearsing of those things which that railing Germane hath heaped up in his leud pasquill: whom also I could bring in, repeating his friendly verses of the Islanders, within the compasse of this my booke, but that I doe foresee that 180{n}the sayd slanderous libell being stuffed with so many and divers reproches, might breed offence to all honest men, and deterre them from reading it, with the filthinesse thereof.{n}I will therefore repeat the principali matters (omitting those things which he hath common with others, or, that heretofore have beene examined) but farre more modestly then he, least (as I sayd) I cause good and learned mens eares to tingle at his leud and unseemely rimes: they that are desirous to see or heare him, let them enquire at the Stationers. It is no part of our meaning (I say) to defile these papers with his stinking slanders, or with the filthy sinke of his reproches.{n}First therefore, this our goodly Germane Historic- The first grapher objecteth that there be many Pastours in Island, objec,ion or which preach not to their people once in two yeres, as p ' it is read in the former edition of this pasquill, which notwithstanding the latter edition doth refute: saying that the sayd Pastours use to preach but five times in an whole yeere: which two, how well they agree together, let the reader be judge, seeing it is manifest that the authour himselfe, presently after the first edition, had scarse seene Island. So oftentimes one lie betrayeth another, according to that saying: Trueth agreeth unto trueth; but falshood agreeth neither to trueth nor to falshood.{n}But sith it is our part not to dissemble the trueth in any place, we will not denie that holy sermons, about the time wherein this sycophant lived in Island, namely in the yere 1554, were seldomer in use then they are at this day, namely, the darkenesse of popery being scarsely at that time dispelled. Which also is to be understood concerning the Psalmes of David mumbled by the common people in Latine, as he casteth us in the teeth: for the Papists grounding all the hope of their salvation in the Masse, did little regard the sermon, or doctrine. But after we were freed from that mist, it hath bene (God be thanked) farre otherwise with us: although we cannot{n}181{n}altogether excuse the dulnesse, slouth, and preposterous care of certeine of our Pastours. Which, whether it agreeth to any of their countreymen or no, let other nations judge.{n}The twelfth section.{n}The second Secondly, the trifler shamefully reporteth, that adulteries teproch. and whoredomes are not onely publique, and common vices amongst Islanders: but that they are not accounted by them for vices.{n}ALthough indeed these most filthy abominations, even in our common wealth, be not altogether unusuall: notwithstanding, since all men know that they are farre more common in other nations, where be greater multitudes of people, he did undeservedly, and maliciously note the Islanders rather with this reproch, then other people and nations, who are more infamous with this crime then our countreymen.{n}And albeit I wish with all mine heart that vices and enormities were much lesse wincked at in our countrey, then we see they are, yet notwithstanding this jugler, by reason of his natural inclination to backbiting, hath added this in his last reproch: namely, that these vices by the Iselanders are not accounted for vice. For, in what common wealth dare the impudent companion affirme this to be true ? What ? in that common wealth which hath sworne to observe the law contained in our statute booke under the title of Manhelge chap. 28, whereby it is enacted, that whosoever committeth adultery with another mans wife the second time, his goods being {I. 586.] confiscate, he shall be punished with death ? Or in that common wealth, which not long since hath inflicted the penalty of 80 dallers upon a servant committing adultery with his masters wife ? Or in that common wealth which hath decreed, that if he doth not pay, nor lay in sureties at the day appointed, he shalbe banished the countrey? Or in that common wealth the politike lawes whereof doe streightly command that whosoever be according to 182{n}law found in adultery with another mans wife, by her husband, if he escape, he shall undergoe the punishment of manslaughter? Or in that common wealth, the politike lawes whereof do also enjoyne a man that is taken in carnail copulation with the mother, daughter, or sister, by the sonne, father, or brother, to redeeme his life with the one halfe of that which he ought to have payed, if he had shed the innocent bloud of the sayd party? Or in that common wealth the politike lawes whereof have noted and condemned adultery under the name of a most heinous offence ? and do straightly command that he which is taken the third time in that beastly act shalbe punished with death?{n}You see therefore (friendly readers) what an injurious Notary we have, affirming that adultery and whoredome in Island deserveth not the name of sinne and wicked-nesse: for although some officers let slip this or that vice unpunished, yet ought not the whole nation, nor the lawes, nor all good and godly men, in that regard, to be accused or evill spoken of.{n}The thirteenth section.{n}The third reproch is, whereby he doth brand the Islanders The third with the marke of deceit and trechery toward the rePnch-Germans.{n}DOubtles the author of this libell was some vagabond huckster or pedler, and had gone particularly into many corners of Island to utter his trumpery wares, which he also testifieth of himselfe in his worthy rimes, that he had travailed thorow the greatest part of Island, whereupon when he had played the cousining mate with others (for often times deceit and lying are joyned together, and he hath sufficiently proved himselfe to be a liar, by this triall of his wit) peradventure himselfe was beguiled by them whom he before time had defrauded.{n}From hence proceedeth this slander against our whole Nation: dissembling in the meane time with what honestie certaine Germans, making yerely voyages into{n}183{n}Island, deale with our men. But seeing by this complaint I have not determined to reproch others, but to lay open the undeserved reproches of others against our nation, I do here of purpose surcease.{n}The foureteenth section.{n}4> 5> 6, Fourthly, he sayth that in bankets none of the ghests ^7 reproches. use tQ rjse from the taye. but that the good wife of the house reacheth to every one a chamber-pot, so oft as need requireth. Moreover, he noteth much unmanerlinesse of eating and drinking at bankets.{n}Fiftly, he objecteth customes of lying in bed, and of dining: namely that ten persons, more or lesse, men and women lie altogether in the same bed, and that they eat their meat lying in bed: and that in the meane time they do nothing but play at dice or at tables.{n}Sixtly, he reporteth that they wash their hands and their faces in pisse.{n}Seventhly, he despightfully abaseth our solemnizings of marriages, spousals, birth-dayes, and our customes at burials.{n}THese, and a number of such like reproches hath this impure slanderer spued foorth against an innocent nation, yea and that nation which hath deserved right well of him and his countrimen. Which are of the same kind with these, in so much that we altogether disdeigne to make answere unto them. For, that we may graunt (which notwithstanding we will in no case yeelde unto) that this worthy Germane notarie observed some such matter among base companions, and the very of-scouring of the common people, with whom he was much more conversant then with good and honest persons (for he had lived, as his rimes testifie, somewhat long upon the coast of Island, whither a confused rout of the meanest common people, in fishing time do yerely resort, who being naught aswell through their owne leudnesse, as by 184{n}1592. the wicked behaviour of outlandish mariners, often times doe leade a badde and dishonest life) notwithstanding we are in this place more manifestly wronged through the knavery of this one varlet, and desperate sycophant by his defaming of the whole nation (as others also usually do) then that it should neede any refutation at all. Of which thing strangers themselves, who are not a little conversant in our Iland, may be most sufficient witnesses.{n}I could also gather together many such filthy, unmannerly, and baudie fashions noted by others even in his own countrey. But I detest this dogged eloquence, neither take I any pleasure to be witty in the  disgracing of others: and yet I will not shew my selfe such a milke-soppe as to be daunted with light words. Onely, let all honest and good men consider, what disposition it argueth, for one to object against a whole nation certaine misdemeanours committed by some one or other particular man. If any man should travell thorowout all the cities and townes of Germanie or any other nation, and heaping together the offences, and most leud maners, the robberies, manslaughters, murthers, whoredomes, adulteries, incests, riots, extortions, and other prophane, and filthy actes, should affirme them to be common to all Germans, or otherwise to any other whole nation, and should exaggerate all these things with notorious lies, is he to be accounted one that spends his time in a good argument ? But what marvaile is it, though a varlet, and, that I may give him his true title, a filthy hogge, that rimer (I say) hath bewrayed his nature and disposition in such like reproches ? For it is well knowen that swine, when they enter into most pleasant gardens, do not plucke lillies, or roses, or any other most beautifull and sweet flowers ; but thrusting their snouts into the ground, doe tumble and tosse up and downe whatsoever durt and dung they can finde, untill they have rooted up most uncleane things, namely such as are best agreeable to their nature, wherewith they greedily{n}185{n}glut themselves : Even so this hoggish Rimer lightly passeth over the best and most commendable things of our Common wealth, but as for the woorst, and those which have beene committed by none, or by very few, namely, such things as best fit his humour and disposition (that he might indeed shew himselfe to be the same which we have termed him) those things (I say) hath he scraped up together: whereupon hereafter by my consent, for his maners and disposition let him enjoy the name of a swine.{n}The fifteenth section.{n}The ninth XT 7"Ee will heere rehearse the ninth reproch, which reproch. VV that slanderous hogge hath drawen from the maner of living, and specially from the meat and drinke of the Islanders, and that not in one or a few wordes, but in a large invective : namely, that they eate olde and unsavoury meates, and that, without the use of bread. Also, that they eate divers kinds of fishes which are unknowen to strangers : and that they mingle water and whey together for drinke. All which this venemous pasquill, with eloquent railing and wittie slaunder hath set out at the full.{n}And albeit we doe scarse vouchsafe to stand longer about answering of him, yet in regard of others, who at this day partly woonder at the matter, and partly object it to our nation, we thought good to adde some few things in this place.{n}First therefore we will divide this our nation into two parts : into beggers, and those that susteine both themselves, and, amongst others, beggers also. As touching all kinds of meats wherewith beggers and other poore men satisfie their hunger, it is no easie matter to rehearse and examine them : neither, because extreame necessity hath at some times compelled them to eate this or that, therefore is it meet to prescribe certeine kindes and number of meats to the rest of the nation. For we have also a law amone the canons 186{n}1592. apostolicall, which forbiddeth to eat things strangled : in the observing of which canons, antiquity hath seemed to be very devout.{n}Moreover, we will make a distinction of times also, that it may seeme no strange accident in the time of famine, though many things are, and have bene used by a great number of men to satisfie their hunger, which at other times are scarse meat for dogges. As very lately in the yeere 1590 we heard concerning the citizens of Paris, being environed with the most streight siege of Henrie the fourth, King of Navarre, suffering (as Petrus Lindebergius speaketh) the famine of Saguntum : insomuch that they did not onely eate their horses, but also taking the flesh of dead men, and beating their bones to powder in a morter, they mingled therewith a handfull or two of meale, esteeming it dainties. And it is well knowen also of other nations, who in the like urgent necessities have lived by eating of mise, cats and dogs. In like maner sometimes are we Islanders constrained to doe, not being besieged by our enemies (although hitherto we have absteined from mans flesh, yea, and to our knowledge, from dogs, mise, and cats) for whereas we provide things necessary for food out of the land and sea, & no sustenance, or very little, is brought unto us by strangers : so often as God withholdeth his gifts of land and sea, then must follow and ensue a dreadfull scarsity of victuals, whereupon the inhabitants are sometimes vexed with grievous famine. And therefore it is likely that they amongst us which used to live from hand to mouth, and had not some provision of former yeeres remaining, have beene driven to great extremities, so often as need hath enforced them thereunto. But whether this thing ought woorthily to minister occasion to a publike and perpetuali reproch against the Islanders, more then other nations, I referre it to the judgement of indifferent and honest mindes.{n}Moreover, whereas divers use to object concerning  187{n}The Islanders meanes of preserving their meates without salt.{n}the proper & accustomed fare of our country, especially of flesh, fish, butter being long time kept without salt : also concerning white-meats, want of corne, drinking of water, and such like : in most places of Island (for there be many of our countrimen also, who, after the maner of the Danes and Germans so farre foorth as ought in a meane to suffice chast and temperate minds, although we have not any great varitie of sauce, being destitute of Apothecaries shops, are of ability to furnish their table, and to live moderately) we confesse it to be even so : namely that the foresaid kinds of victuals are used in most places without the seasoning of salt. And I wil further adde, that the very same meats, which certaine strangers abhorre so much as to name, yet strangers themselves, when they are among us do use to eat them with delight. For albeit for the most part we have no corne, nor meale, nor yet salt the provocation of gluttony, for the seasoning of our victuals, is common to us all: yet notwithstanding almighty God of his goodnesse hath taught our men also the way, how they should handle, and keepe in store those things which belong to the sustentation of life, to the end it may appeare, that God in nourishing and susteining of us Islanders, is not tyed to bread and salt.{n}But whereas strangers boast that all their victuals are more pleasant and wholesome : yet we denie that to be a sufficient reason, why they should upbraid us in regard of ours : neither do we thinke God to be a debter unto our deinty mouthes : but rather we give him thanks with our whole hearts, that he vouchsafeth without this delicate and nice fare, which is esteemed to be so pleasant and wholesome, to grant even unto the men of our countrey many yeeres, and a good age as also constant health, and flourishing strength of body ; all which we account to be signes of wholesome and convenient nourishment, and of a perfect constitution. Besides, our wits are not altogether so grosse and barren, 188{n}as the philosophers seeme to assigne unto this our aier, and these nourishments, which perhaps many of our countreymen could much rather verifie in deeds then in words, if (as the Poet sayth) envious poverty did not holde us downe.{n}But here the judgement of the common people, as often in other matters, doth too plainly deceive (I except all good and well experienced men) some of them which would seeme to be wise: namely, that whatsoever their use doth not admit, or that they have not seene, nor had triall of beforetime, they presently condemne. As for example, he that never saw the sea will not be persuaded that there is a mediterrane sea : so doe they measure all things by their owne experience and conceit, as though there were nothing good and profitable, but that onely wherewith they mainteine their lives. But we are not growen to that pitch of folly, that because we have heard of certeine people of Aethiopia, which are fed with locusts, being therefore called by Diodorus, Acridophagi, and of a certaine nation of India also, whom Clitarchus & Megastenes have named Mandri, as Agatarchides witnesseth, or of others that live upon frogs or sea-crabs, or round shrimps, which thing is at this day commonly knowen, that (I say) we should therefore presume to make them a laughing stocke to the common people, because we are not accustomed to such sustenance.{n}The sixteenth section.{n}TEnthly, that uncivil! beast casteth our men in the The tenth reteeth with their good hospitality. They do not frocfl-{n}(sayth he) carry about mony with them in their purses, neither is it any shame to be enterteined in a strange place, and to have meat and drinke bestowed of free cost. For if they had any thing which they might impart with others, they would very gladly. Moreover, he maketh mention of certeine churches or holy chappels (as of a base thing) which many of the Islanders have 189{n}built in their owne houses: & that first of all in the morning, they have recourse thither, to make their prayers, neither do they suffer any man before they have done their devotion, to interrupt them. These be the things which he hath set downe as some notable disgrace unto the Islanders. And no marvell:{n}For filthy swine detest all cleanly ones, And hogs uncleane regard not precious stones.{n}Which I feare, least it may be too truely affirmed of this slanderer, as it is manifest out of these two last objections.{n}Howbeit, sithens he himselfe is a most sufficient witnesse of his owne vertues, we will referre the reader, who is desirous to know more of him unto his booke of rimes against Island, which we have now examined in our former sections: at whose railing & filthy speeches we have bene ashamed on his behalfe: insomuch that those things which he with satyrical, satyrical ? nay sathanicall biting and reviling of our nation, hath not blushed to write, are irksome for us to repeat: so great & abominable is his insolency, & his reproches so heinous. Good God! whosoever shall view this cartlode of slanders (for we have mentioned the least part thereof, because I was loth to lose my labour, or, as the wise man sayth, to answere a foole according to his  foolishnesse, whereas in his rimes there is not one word without a reproch) will he not judge the authour of this pasquill to have bene a most lewde man, yea the very drosse of mankinde, without pietie, without humanitie ?{n}But here I have just occasion to doubt whether the authour of these revilings hath bene the more injurious to Islanders, or the Printer thereof Joachimus Leo (and whatsoever else they be who in their editions dare neither professe their owne name, nor the name of their Citie) which Leo hath nowe twise, if not oftner, published the saide pamphlet at Hamburg. Doe you suffer this to goe unpunished, O ye counsell and commons of Ham-190{n}burg ? What ? Have you determined to gratifie Island in this sort, which these many yeeres, by reason of your aboundant traffique with us, and your transporting home of all our commodities, of our beeves and muttons, and commo-of an incredible deale of butter and fishes, hath bene ^esofl^and-unto your Ci tie in stead of a storehouse ? In times past ancient also, certaine Cities of England and of Holland have t^iue of reaped the commodities or this Isle : Moreover, there island hath bene ancient traffique of Denmarke, Breme, and Lubeck with the Islanders. But they never gained by any of their chapmen such commendations, and such thanks, as are conteined in this libell: It hath in your, in your Citie (I. say) bene bred, brought foorth, iterated, if not the thirde time published: which hath armed other people, unto whom the name of Island was otherwise scarce knowne, to the disdaine and contempt of this our Nation : and this injurie offered by a Citizen of yours, hath Island susteined these 30. yeeres and more, and doeth as yet susteine. But many such accidents often come to passe without the knowledge of the magistrate, neither do we doubt but that good men are grieved at such infamous libels, and do take diligent heed that they be not published: for such editions are contrary to the lawe of nature : Doe not that to another which thou wouldest not have done unto thy selfe: and to{n}the lawes Emperial of infamous libels: wherein is Lawes against enjoyned a most grievous penaltie unto those, who invent, write, utter, or cause such libels to be bought or sold, or do not presently upon the finding thereof teare them in pieces.{n}But now time bids us to sound a retreat: and to returne home unto thee Island (our most deare mother) whom neither povertie, nor colde, nor any other such inconveniences shall make ircksome unto us, so long as thou ceasest not to give heartie and willing entertainment unto Christ: where, first we doe earnestly exhort thee to the serious and ardent affection, and love of God, and of the heavenly knowledge reveiled unto us in Christ:{n}191{n}that thou wouldest preferre this before all things, being enflamed with desire of doctrine, and of the worde: that thou wouldest not lightly esteeme, contemne or hate the holy ministerie and ministers, but reverence, cherish, and love them. Accompting those that practise the contrary as wicked and prophane: and managing all thine affaires both private and publique, according to the prescript rule of pietie and honestie, that unto this, thy states and orders Ecclesiasticall and politique may in all things be conformed: and so in either kinde of life relying thy selfe upon that levell and line of equitie and justice, and avoyding others, who upon stubbernesse and impietie swerve therefrom. That thou wouldest also inflict just punishments upon offenders: All which we doubt not but the Magistrate will have respect unto. But especially that thou admittest none to be Magistrates, but men of approved fidelitie and honestie, and such as may adjoyne unto these vertues others hereto belonging, by which meanes inconveniences may fitly be prevented. For if this matter be well handled, namely that they which are the best of all good men be chosen to beare publique authoritie, wicked and unfit men being altogether rejected; the condition of the subjects shalbe most prosperous: the lives and maners of all men shal prove by so much the more commendable: godlinesse also and honestie shal become the more glorious. But on the contrary, if pastours of Churches be not answerable to their function, either in life or doctrine; if all men without respect or difference be admitted to the government of the common wealth, who aspire thereunto by their owne rashnesse, ambition, or avarice, and desire of honour, yea though they be suspected or convicted of crimes and dishonestie, or be pro tectours or unjust favourers of such persons as are suspected and convicted; then what will be thy state, oh Island ? What wil be thy outward shew or condition ? Doubtlesse most miserable. Neither shalt thou by any other meanes more suddenly approch to thy ruine and destruction,{n}192{n}i592-then if thou committest thy selfe to the government of such men, who to the uttermost of their power, although they be of thine owne brood, dayly seeke thine overthrow for their owne private advantage and secret malice. Wherefore (to be short) let these be to advertise my deare Country, how behovefiill it is that the matters aforesaid be put in practise.{n}But whilest I am speaking these things unto thee (my Countrey) oh that my deepe and dolefull sighes, which lie hid in the former speach, might pierce the eares of our Kings most excellent Majestie, before whom, on thy behalfe I doe bewaile the publique miseries, which in this respect especially doe arise, because wee are so farre distant from the seate and royall presence of our King, that many therefore take more libertie, and promise more securi tie of offending unto themselves. But we  will commit all these matters to the most just Judge of heaven and earth who beholdeth all things in equitie.{n}Nowe it remaineth (my beloved Countrey) that thou wouldest take in good part these my labours employed in thy service, and accept them with that favourable and courteous minde which I have expected. And although they be not of such worth as I could wish, yet sith a willing minde is worth all, I would not therefore give over because I mistrusted my selfe as one insufficient to contend for thine innocencie, for thy reputation, and thine honour, my deare Countrey. But rather whatsoever it be (if it be ought) and how mickle-soever which for my slender abilitie I was able to afford in thy defence, I thought good not to suppresse it : for I esteeme not those men worthy of commendation, who despairing{n}To overgrow the limmes of Lyco stoute, Neglect to cure their bodies of the goute.{n}And in very deed, it doeth no whit repent me of my labour, if this little treatise shall tend neither to thine nor to mine owne disgrace. But if it shall any{n}iv	193	N{n}thing availe to thine honour or defence, I will thinke my travaile right well bestowed. Yea, if by this my slender attempt I may but onely excite other of thy children, and my native Countreymen, being farre my superiours both in learning and industrie to take thy cause in hand, either nowe or hereafter, what reason is there why any man should say that it is not worth my labour ? Nowe, if they addresse themselves to write, howsoever my fame shalbe obscured, yet will I comfort my selfe with their excellencie, who are like to impaire my credite : for albeit a man ought to have speciali regard of his name and fame, yet is he to have more of his Countrey, whose dignitie being safe and sound, we also must needes esteeme our selves to be in safetie.{n}Written at Holen Hialtedale in Island, the yeere of our Lord 1592. the 17. of the Kalends of May.{n}.
