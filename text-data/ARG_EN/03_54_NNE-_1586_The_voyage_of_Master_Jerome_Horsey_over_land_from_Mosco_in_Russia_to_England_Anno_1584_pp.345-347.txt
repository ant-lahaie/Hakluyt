Master Horsey having received the letters and requests of the Emperour, provided for his journey over land, .and departed from Mosco the lift day of September, thence unto Otver, to Torshook, to great Novogrod, to Vobsky, and thence to Nyhouse in Livonia, to Wenden, and so to Riga : (where he was beset, and brought foorthwith before a Cardinali called Ragevil, but yet suffred to passe in the end :) From thence to Mito, to Golden, and Libou in Curland, to Memel, to Konings-burgh in Prussia, to Elbing, to Dantzike, to Stetine in Pomerland, to Rostock, to Lubeck, to Hamborough, to Breme, to Emden, and by sea to London. Being arrived at her majesties roiall court, and having delivered the Emperors letters with good favour, and gracious acceptance, he was foorthwith againe commaunded to repasse into Russia, with other letters from her majestie to the Emperor, and prince Boris Pheodorowich, answering the Emperors letters, and withall requesting the favour and friendship, which his father had yeelded to the English merchants : and hereunto was he earnestly also solicited by the merchants of London themselves of that company, to deale in their behalfe. Being thus dispatched from London by sea, he arrived in Mosco, the 20. of April 1586. and was very honorably welcommed. And 345

for ye merchants behoofe, obtained all his requests, being therein specially favoured by ye noble prince Boris Pheo-dorowich, who alwayes affected M. Horsey with speciali liking. And having obtained priviledges for the merchants, he was recommended from the Emperor againe, to the Queene of England his mistresse, by whom the prince Boris, in token of his honorable and good opinion of the Queens majestie, sent her highnesse a roiall present of Sables, Luzarns, cloth of gold and other rich things. So that the Companie of English merchants, next to their thankfulnes to her majestie, are to account M. Horseis paines their speciali benefit, who obtained for them those privileges, which in twentie yeeres before would not be granted.
The maner of M. Horseis last dispatch from the Emperor, because it was very honorable, I thought good to record. He was freely allowed post horses for him and his servants, victuals and all other necessaries for his long journey ; at every towne that he came unto from Mosco to Vologda, which is by land five hundred miles, he received the like free and bountifull allowances, at the Emperors charge. New victuali and provision were given him upon the river Dwina at every towne by the kings officers, being one thousand miles in length. When he came to the new castle called Archangel, he was received of the Duke Knez Vasili Andrewich Isveno-gorodsky by the Emperors commission into the Castle,, gunners being set in rankes after their use, where he was sumptuously feasted : from thence hee was dispatched with bountifull provision and allowance in the Dukes boat, with one hundred men to rowe him, and one hundred Gunners in other boats to conduct him, with a gentleman captaine of the Gunners. Comming to the road where the English, Dutch, and French ships rode, the gunners discharged, and the ships shot in like maner 46. pieces of their ordinance, & so he was brought ta his lodging at the English house upon Rose Island.
And that which was the full and complete conclusion
