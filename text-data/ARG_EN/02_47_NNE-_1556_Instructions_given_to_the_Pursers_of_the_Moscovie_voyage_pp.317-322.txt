Certaine instructions delivered in the third voyage, Anno 1556. for Russia, to every Purser and the rest of the servants, taken for the voyage, which may serve as good and necessary directions, to all other like adventurers.
i Ir^^^^^^^^llrst you shall before the ship doth 0 mSNPw begin to lade, goe aboord, and shall ®	there take, and write one inventorie,
2 IRSvWH® by the advise of the Master, or of »	some other principali officer there
aboord, of all the tackle, apparell, -------:---------- cables, ankers, ordinance, chambers, shot, powder, artillerie, and of all other necessaries whatsoever doth belong to the sayd ship : and the same justly taken, you shall write in a booke, making the sayd Master, or such officer privie of that which you haveso written, so that the same may not be denied, when they shall call accompt thereof: that done, you shall write a copie of the same with your owne hand, which you shall deliver before the shippe  shall depart, for the voyage to the companies booke keeper here to be kept to their behalfe, to the ende that they may be justly answered the same, when time shall require: and this order to be seene and kept every voyage orderly, by the Pursers of the companies owne ship, in any wise.
2	Also when the shippe beginneth to lade, you shall be ready a boord with your booke, to enter such goods as shall be brought aboord, to be laden for the company, packed, or unpacked, taking the markes and numbers of every packe, fardell, trusse, or packet, corovoya, chest, fatte, butte, pipe, puncheon, whole barrell, halfe barrell, firken, or other caske, maunde, or basket, or any other thing, which may, or shall be packed by any other manner of waies or devise. And
317
first, all such packes, or trusses, &c. as shal be brought aboord to be laden, not marked by the companies marke, you shall doe the best to let that the same be not laden, and to enquire diligently to know the owners thereof, if you can, and what commoditie the same is, that is so brought aboord to be laden : if you can not know the owners of such goods, learne what you can thereof, as well making a note in your booke, as also to send or bring word thereof to the Agent, and to some one of the foure Marchants with him adjoined so speedily as you can, if it be here laden or to be laden in this river, being not marked with the companies marke, as is aforesaid : and when the sayd shippe hath received in all that the companies Agent will have laden, you shal make a just copie of that which is laden, reciting the parcels, the markes and numbers of every thing plainely, which you shall likewise deliver to the sayd bookekeeper to the use aforesayd.
3	Also when the ship is ready to depart, you shall come for your cockets and letters to the Agent, and shall shew him all such letters as you have received of any person or persons privately or openly, to be delivered to any person or persons in Russia or elsewhere, and also to declare if you know any other that shall passe in the ship either master or mariner that hath received any letters to be privily delivered to any there, directed from any person or persons, other then from the Agent here to the Agent there : which letters so by you received, you shall not carie with you, without you be licenced so to doe by the Agent here, and some of the foure merchants, as is aforesayd : and such others as do passe, having received any privie letters to be delivered, you shal all that in you lieth, let the deliverie of them at your arriving in Russia : and also if you have or do receive, or shal know any other that doth or hath received any goods or ready money to be imployed in Russia, or to bee delivered there to any person or 318
persons from any person or persons, other then such as bee the companies goods, and that under their marke, you shall before the ship doeth depart, declare the same truely to the sayd Agent, and to some of the other merchants to him adjoyned, as it is before declared.
4	Also when the shippe is ready to depart, and hath the master and the whole company aboord, you shall diligently foresee and take heede, that there passe not any privie person or persons, other then such as be authorized to passe in the said ship, without the licence and warrant of one of the Governours and of the assistants, for the same his passage, to be first shewed. And if there be any such person or persons that is to passe and will passe without shewing the same warrant, you shall let the passage of any such to the uttermost of your power: And for that there may no such privie person passe under the cloke and colour of some mariner, you shall upon the weying of your ships anker, call the master and the mariners within boord by their names and that by your bookes, to the ende that you may see that you have neither more nor lesse, but just the number for the voyage.
5	Also you must have in remembrance, that if it shall chance the shippe to bee put into anie harbour in this coast by contrary windes or otherwise in making the voyage, to send word thereof from time to time as the case shall require, by your letters in this maner. To master I. B. Agent for the company of the New trades in S. in London: If you doe hier any to bring your letters, write that which he must have for the portage. And for your better knowledge and learning, you shall do very well to keepe a dayly note of the voyage both outwards and homewards.
6	And principally see that you forget not dayly in all the voiage both morning and evening, to call the company within boord to prayer, in which doing you shall please God, and the voiage will have the better successe thereby, and the company prosper the better.
319
7	Also in calme weather and at other times when you shall fortune to come to anker in the seas during the voyage, you shall for the companies profite, and for the good husbanding of the victuals aboord, call upon the Boateswaine and other of the company to use such hookes and other engines as they have aboord to take fish with, that such fish so taken may bee eaten for the cause aforesayd: and if there bee no such engines aboord, then to provide some before you goe from hence.
8	And when God shall send you in safetie into the Bay of S. Nicholas at an anker, you shall goe a shore with the first boate that shall depart from the ship, taking with you such letters as you have to deliver to the Agent there: and if he be not there at your comming a land, then send the companies letters to Colmogro to him by some sure mariner or otherwise, as the master and you shall thinke best, but goe not your selfe at any hand, nor yet from aboord the ship, unlesse it bee a shore to treate with the Agent for the lading of the ship that you be appointed in, which you shall applie diligently to have done so speedily as may be. And for the discharging of the goods therein in the Bay, to be carried from thence, see that you doe looke well to the unlading thereof, that there be none other goods sent a shore then the companies, and according to the notes entred in your booke as is aforesaid: if there be, inquire diligently for whom they bee, and what goods they be, noting who is the receiver of the sayd goods, in such sort that the company may have the true knowledge thereof at your comming home.
9	Also there a shore, and likewise aboord, you shall spie and search as secretly as you may, to learne and know what bargaining, .buying and selling there is with the master and the mariners of the shippe and the Russes, or with the companies servants there : and that which you shall perceive and learne, you shall keepe a note thereof in your booke secretly to your selfe, which you shall open and disclose at your comming home to
320
the governours and assistants, in such sorte as the trueth of their secret trades and occupyings may be revealed and knowen. You shal need alwayes to have Argos eyes, to spie their secret packing and conveyance, aswell on land as aboord the shippe, of and for such furres and other commodities, as yeerely they doe use to buy, packe and convey hither. If you will bee vigilant and secrete in this article, you cannot misse to spie their privie packing one with another, either on shore or aboord the shippe: worke herein wisely, and you shall deserve great thanks of the whole company.
io Also at the lading againe of the shippe, you shall continue and abide abord, to the ende that you may note and write in your booke all such goods and marchandises as shall be brought and laden, which you shall orderly note in all sortes as heretofore, as in the second article partly it is touched: and in any wise put the Master and the company in remembrance, to looke and foresee substantially to the roomaging of the shippe, by faire meanes or threats, as you shall see and thinke will serve for the best.
11	Thus when the shippe is full laden againe, and all things aboord in good order, and that you doe fortune to goe a shore to the Agent for your letters, and dispatch away: you shall demand whether all the goods be laden that were brought thither, and to know the trueth therof, you shal repaire to the companies storehouse there at S. Nicholas, to see if there be any goods left in the sayd storehouse: if there be, you shal demand why they be not laden, and note what kinde of goods they be that be so left: and seeing any of the shippes there not fully laden, you shall put the Agent in remembrance to lade those goods so left, if any such be to be laden, as is aforesayd. And thus God sending you a faire wind, to make speede and away.
12	Finally, when God shall send you to arrive againe upon this coast in safetie, either at Harewich, or else-n	321	x
where, goe not you aland, if you may possiblie, to the ende that when you be gone a shore, there may no goods be sent privily ashore to be solde, or else to be solde aboord the ship in your absence, but keepe you still aboord, if you can by any meanes, for the causes aforesaid, and write the company a letter from the shippe of your good arrivall, which you may convey to them by land by some boy or mariner of the shippe, or otherwise as you shall thinke best: and likewise when God shall send you and the shippe into the river here, doe not in any wise depart out of the shippe that you be in, until the company doe send some other aboord the shippe, in your steede and place, to keepe the shippe in your absence.
