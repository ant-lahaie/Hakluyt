And seeing we continue still the same good will towards your excellency, we doe even promise to our selfe your honourable kindnesses towards him : and we pray the almightie God to preserve your Majesty in good safetie and health. Given at our pallace of Greene-wich the 19 day of June, in the yere of our Lord 1583, and of our reigne the five and twentieth.{n}.
