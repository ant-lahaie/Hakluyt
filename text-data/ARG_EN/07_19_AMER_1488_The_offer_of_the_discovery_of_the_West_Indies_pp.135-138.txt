The offer of the discovery of the West Indies  by Christopher Columbus to king Henry the seventh in the yeere 1488 the 13 of February: with the kings acceptation of the offer, & the cause whereupon hee was deprived of the same: recorded in the thirteenth chapter of the history of Don Fernand Columbus of the life and deeds of his father Christopher Columbus.{n}The same in English.{n}/"^Hristopher Columbus fearing least if the king of V-U Castile in like maner (as the king of Portugall had done) should not condescend unto his enterprise, he should be inforced to offer the same againe to some other prince, 8c so much time should be spent therein, sent into England a certaine brother of his which he had with him, whose name was Bartholomew Columbus, who, albeit he had not the Latine tongue, yet neverthelesse was a man of experience and skilfull in Sea causes, and could very wel make sea cards & globes, and other instruments belonging to that profession, as he was instructed by his brother. Wherfore after that Bartholomew Columbus was departed for England, his lucke was to fall into the hands of pirats, which spoiled him with the rest of them which were in the ship which he went in. Upon which occasion, and by reason of his poverty and sicknesse which cruelly assaulted him in a countrey so farre distant from his friends, he deferred his am-bassage for a long while, untill such time as he had{n}gotten somewhat handsome about him with making of Sea fir England. cards. At length he began to deale with king Henry the seventh the father of Henry the eight, which reigneth at this present: unto whom he presented a mappe of the world, wherein these verses were written, which I found among his papers: and I will here set them downe, rather for their antiquity then for their goodnesse.{n}Thou which desirest easily the coasts of lands to know, This comely mappe right learnedly the same to thee will shew:{n}Which Strabo, Plinie, Ptolomew and Isodore maintaine: Yet for all that they do not all in one accord remaine.{n}137{n}.{n}The occasion why the West Indies were not discovered{n}King Henry the seventh his acceptation of Columbus offer.{n}Here also is set downe the late discovered burning Zone{n}By Portingals, unto the world which whilom was un-knowen,{n}Whereof the knowledge now at length thorow all the world is blowen;{n}And a little under he added:{n}For the Authour or the Drawer.{n}He, whose deare native soile hight stately Genua, Even he whose name is Bartholomew Colon de Terra{n}Rubra,{n}The yeere of Grace a thousand and foure hundred and fourescore{n}And eight, and on the thirteenth day of February more,{n}In London published this worke. To Christ all laud therefore.{n}And because some peradventure may observe that he calleth himselfe Columbus de Terra Rubra, I say, that in like maner I have seene some subscriptions of my father Christopher Columbus, before he had the degree of Admirall, wherein he signed his name thus, Columbus de Terra Rubra. But to returne to the king of England, I say, that after he had seene the map, and that which my father Christopher Columbus offered unto him, he accepted the offer with joyfull countenance, and sent to call him into England. But because God had reserved the sayd offer for Castile, Columbus was gone in the meane space, and also returned with the performance of his enterprise, as hereafter in order shall be rehearsed. Now will I leave off from making any farther mention of that which Bartholomew Colon had negotiated in England, and I will returne unto the Admirall, &c.{n}.
