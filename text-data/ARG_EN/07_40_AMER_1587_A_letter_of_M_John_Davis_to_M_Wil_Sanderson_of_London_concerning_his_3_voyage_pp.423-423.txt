A letter of the sayd M. John Davis written to M. Sanderson of London concerning his forewritten voyage.
Ood M. Sanderson, with Gods great mercy I have made my safe returne in health, with all my company, and have sailed threescore leagues further then my determination at my departure. I have bene in 73 degrees, finding the sea all open, and forty leagues betweene land
and land. The passage is most probable, the execution easie, as at my comming you shall fully know.
Yesterday the 15 of September I landed all weary; therefore I pray you pardon my shortnesse.
Sandridge this 16 of September anno 1587.
Yours equall as mine owne, which by triall you shall best know, John Davis.
