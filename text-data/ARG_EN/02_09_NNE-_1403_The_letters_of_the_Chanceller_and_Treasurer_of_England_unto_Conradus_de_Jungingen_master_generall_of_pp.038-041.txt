In consideration of which piracies and molestations, your messengers demanded full restitution and recompense to be made, either unto the damnified parties, or unto their procurators. We therefore at that time, especially being in the presence of our soveraigne (who with his puissant army tooke his progresse towards the remote part of Wales being subject unto his dominion, to see justice executed upon his people of those parts, who very rashly have presumed to rebell against him their sovereigne, contrary to their allegeance) right well perceived that it was his highnesse intention, that every one should have due justice faithfully administred unto him, especially your subjects, and that with all favour, whom he hath alwayes in times past right graciously intreated, as if they had bene his owne liege subjects and native countrey men, whome also hee purposeth hereafter friendly to protect: insomuch that betweene him and his subjects on the one party, and betweene you and yours on the other party, great abundance and perfection of mutuall amity may increase. And therefore we offered unto your foresayd messengers, after they had particularly declared unto us such piracies and wrongs, to sende the kings letters unto them of whom complaint was made, firmely injoyning them, under grievous penalties, that without delay they restore or cause to bee restored unto the parties damnified, or unto their procuratours, all ships, marchandises, wares, and goods, by them taken or violently stolne from your subjects. And that your said messengers may partly attaine their desire, we have{n}\ Namely the ship of Edgard Scof at Caleis.

Howbeit, as touching other goods, which are perhaps perished or wanting by infortunate dissipation or destruction, and for the which the said messengers of yours demand satisfaction to be made unto them within a certain time by us limited: may it please your honor to understand, that in the absence of our sayd sovereigne lord the king, being as yet farre distant from us, wee can in no wise limit or set downe any such terme of time. Notwithstanding, at the prosperous returne of our soveraigne, we are determined to commune with him about this matter. Of whose{n}answere so soone as we be certified, we purpose to signifie his intention unto you by our letters. Sithens also (right reverend and mighty lord) your sayd messengers are contented, for the present, to accept of our offer aforesayde, as indeede by all reason they ought thereat to rest content, especially whereas by this meanes they shall the more speedily attaine unto the effect of their purposes (to the shorte and wished execution and performance of which offer, we will, by Gods helpe, endevour, to the utmost of our ability) may it be your will and pleasure, that as in the kingdome of England, your marchants and subjects are courteously intreated : even so the marchants and liege people of our soveraigne lord the king and of his kingdomes peaceably frequenting your parts, either in regard of traffique or of any other just occasion, may there in like manner friendly bee used, and with your marchants and subjects suffered to communicate, and to have intercourse of traffique, injoying the commodities of the ancient league. By this also the fervent zeale and affection which you beare unto the royall crowne of England shall undoubtedly appeare: albeit betweene the famous houses of England and of Prussia, the bandes of unfained love and friendship have bin successively confirmed and kept inviolable in times Note well. past.
