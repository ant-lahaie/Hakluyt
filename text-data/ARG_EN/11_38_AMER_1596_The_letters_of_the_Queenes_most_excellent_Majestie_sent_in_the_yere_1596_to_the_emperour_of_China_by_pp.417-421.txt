The letters of the Queenes most excellent Majestie sent in the yere 1596 unto the great Emperor of China by M. Richard Allot and M. Thomas Bromefield marchants of the citie of London, who were embarqued in a fleet of 3 ships, to wit, The Beare, The Beares whelpe, and the Benjamin; set forth principally at the charges of the honourable knight Sir Robert Duddely, and committed unto the command and conduct of M. Benjamin Wood, a man of ap-prooved skill in navigation: who, together with his ships and company (because we have heard no certaine newes of them since the moneth of February next after their departure) we do suppose, may be arrived upon some part of the coast of China, and may there be stayed by the said Emperour, or perhaps may have some treacherie wrought against them by the Portugales of Macao, or the Spaniards of the Philippinas.{n}418{n}The same in English.{n}ELizabeth by the grace of God Queene of England, France, and Ireland, the most mightie defendresse of the true & Christian faith against all that falsely professe the name of Christ &c. To the most high and soveraigne Prince the most puissant Governour of the great kingdome of China, the chiefest Emperour in those parts of Asia and of the Hands adjoyning, and the great monarke of the orientali regions of the world; wisheth health, and many joyfull and happy yeeres, with all plenty and abundance of things most acceptable. Whereas our honest and faithfull subjects which bring these letters unto your Highnesse, Richard Allot & Thomas Bromefield, marchants of our citie of London in our foresaid kingdome of England, have made most earnest suit unto us, that we would commend their desires and endevours of sayling to the regions of your Empire for traffiques sake: whereas also the fame of your kingdome so strongly and prudently governed, being dispersed and published over the face of the whole earth, hath invited these our subjects not onely to visite your Highnesse dominions, but also to permit themselves to be ruled and governed by the lawes and constitutions of your kingdome during the time of their aboad in those partes of the world, as it becommeth marchants, who for exchange of marchandize are desirous to travell{n}419{n}unto regions so farre distant and not hitherto sufficiently knowen unto these nations of the world, having this regard onely, that they may present their wares and certaine examples or musters of divers kinds of mar-chandizes, wherewith the regions of our dominions do abound, unto the view of your Highnesse and of your subjects, & that they may indevour to know, whether here be any other marchandize with us fit for your use, which (according to the honest & lawfull custome of traffique in all countries) they may exchange for other commodities, whereof in the parts of your Empire there is great plentie both natural and artificiali: We yeelding unto the most reasonable requests of these honest men, because we doe suppose that by this most just intercourse of traffique, no inconvenience nor losse, but rather most exceeding benefite will redound unto the Princes and subjects of both kingdomes, while by the carrying foorth of those commodities wherewith we abound, and the bringing home of others which we want, wee may on either side at most easie rates helpe and inrich one another; doe crave of your most soveraigne Majestie, that these our subjects, when they shall come for{n} traffiques sake unto any the stations, portes, places, townes or cities of your Empire, they may have full and free libertie of egresse and regresse, and of dealing in trade of marchandize with your subjects, may by your Highnesse clemency most firmely enjoy all such freedomes, immunities, and privileges, as are usually granted to the subjects of other Princes which exercise traffique in your dominions; and we on the other side will not onely performe all the offices of a well-willing Prince unto your Highnesse, but also for the greater increase of mutuall love and commerce between us and our subjects, by these present letters of ours doe most willingly grant unto all and every your subjects (if it shall seeme good unto your Highnesse) full and entire libertie unto any of the partes of our dominions to resort, there to abide and traffique, and thence to returne. All and{n}420{n}every of which premisses we have caused to be confirmed by annexing hereunto our royall seale. God most mercifull and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, continually protect your kingly Majestie. Given in our palace at Greenwich the 11 of the moneth of July, in the yeere of Christ 1596, and the eight and thirtie yeere of our reigne.{n}.
