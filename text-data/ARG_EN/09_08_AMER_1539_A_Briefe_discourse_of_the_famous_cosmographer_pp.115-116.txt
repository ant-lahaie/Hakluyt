A discourse of the famous Cosmographer John Baptista Ramusius, concerning the three voyages of Frier Marco de Nica, Francis Vasquez de Coronado, and Ferdinando Al-orchon next following: taken out of his third volume of Navigations and Voyages.{n}He right honourable Don Antonio de Mendoga being sent by Charles the Emperour to be viceroy of Mexico and Nueva Espanna, and having understood that Don Ferdinando Cortez had sent many ships along the coast of Nueva Espanna to discover countries, and to{n}find out the Isles of the Malucos, began himselfe to desire to do the like, as viceroy of Nueva Espanna; and hereupon they fell out: for Cortez said that he was general and discoverer of the South sea, and that it belonged to him to set forth those voyages. On ‚Äù5{n}the other side, the lord Don Antonio alledged that it belonged to him to make that discovery, as being viceroy of Nueva Espanna. So that they fell at great variance, and Cortez returned into Spaine to complaine unto the Emperour. Don Antonio in the meane season having obteined knowledge of the voiage, which Andrew Dorantez (who was one of the company of Pamphilo Narvaez that escaped, as you may reade in the relation of Alvaro Nunnez, called Cabe^a de Vaca) made; sent Frier Marco de Ni?a with a Negro of the said Dorantez to discover that country. Which Frier Marco de Ni?a being returned, & having informed his lordship of all his discovery, he sent captain Francis Vasquez de Coronado with many Spaniards on horsebacke and Indians on foot: likewise he sent a fleete by sea, whereof Ferdinando Alorchon was captaine, as may be seene in the relations following.{n}.
