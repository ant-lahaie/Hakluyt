A Commission given by us Thomas Randolfe Ambassadour for the Queenes Majestic in Russia, and Thomas Bannister, &c. unto James Bassendine, James Woodcocke and Richard Browne, the which Bassendine, Woodcocke, and Browne we appoint joyntly together, and aiders, the one of them to the other, in a voyage of discovery to be made (by the grace of God) by them, for searching of the sea, and border of the coast, from the river Pechora, to the Eastwards, as hereafter followeth Anno 1588. The first of August.
Qprimis, when your barke with all furniture is ready, you shall at the beginning of the yere (assoone as you possibly may) make your repaire to the Easterne part of the river Pechora, where is an Island called Dolgoieve, and from thence you shall passe to the Eastwards alongst
by the Sea coast of Hugorie, or the maine land of 119
Pechora, and sailing alongst by the same coast, you shall passe within seven leagues of the Island Vaigats, which is in the straight, almost halfe way from the coast of Hugorie, unto the coast of Nova Zembla, which Island Vaigats and Nova Zembla you shall finde noted in your plat, therefore you shall not need to discover it: but proceed on alongst the coast of Hugory, towards the river Obba.
There is a Bay betweene the sayd Vaigats, and the river Obba, that doth bite to the Southwards, into the land of Hugory, in which Bay are two small rivers, the one called Cara Reca, the other Naramsy, as in the paper of notes which are given to you herewith may appeare : in the which Bay you shall not need to spend any time for searching of it, but to direct your course to the river Ob (if otherwise you be not constrained to keepe alongst the shore) and when you come to the river Ob you shall not enter into it, but passe over unto the Easterne part of the mouth of the sayd river.
And when you are at the Easterne part of the mouth of Obba Reca, you shall from thence passe to the Eastwards, alongst by the border of the sayd coast, describing the same in such perfect order as you can best do it. You shall not leave the sayd coast or border of the land, but passe alongst by it, at least in sight of the same, untill you have sailed by it so farre to the Eastwards, and the time of the yeere so farre spent, that you doe thinke it time for you to returne with your barke to Winter, which travell may well be 300 or 400 leagues to the Eastwards of the Ob, if the Sea doe reach so farre as our hope is it doth : but and if you finde not the said coast and sea to trend so farre to the Eastwards, yet you shall not leave the coast at any time, but proceed alongst by it, as it doth lie, leaving no part of it unsearched, or seene, unlesse it be some bay, or river, that you doe certeinly know by the report of the people, that you shall finde in those borders, or els some certeine
120
COMMISSION TO BASSENDINE tokens whereby you of your selves may judge it to be so. For our hope is that the said border of land and sea doth in short space after you passe the Ob, incline East, and so to the Southwards. And therefore we would have no part of the land of your starreboord side, as you proceed in your discovery, to be left undiscovered.
But and if the said border of land do not incline so to the Eastwards as we presuppose it, but that it doe prove to incline and trend to the Northwards, and so joyne with Nova Zembla, making the sea from Vaigats to the Eastwards but a bay : yet we will that you do keepe alongst by the said coast, and so bring us certaine report of that forme and maner of the same bay.
And if it doe so prove to be a bay, and that you have passed round about the same, and so by the trending of the land come backe unto that part of Nova Zembla that is against Vaigats, whereas you may from that see the said Island Vaigats, if the time of the yeere will permit you, you shall from thence passe alongst by the said border and coast of Nova Zembla to the Westwards, and so to search whether that part of Nova Zembla doe joyne with the land that sir Hugh Willough-bie discovered in anno 53, and is in 72 degrees, and from that part of Nova Zembla 120 leagues to the Westwards, as your plat doeth shew it unto you : and if you doe finde that land to joyne with Nova Zembla, when you come to it, you shall proceed further along the same coast, if the time of the yere will permit it, and that you doe thinke there will be sufficient time for you to returne backe with your barke to Winter either at Pechora or in Russia, at your discretion : for we refer the same to your good judgements, trusting that you will lose no time, that may further your knowledge in this voyage.
Note you, it was the 20 of August, 56 yer the Serch-thrift began to returne backe from her discoverie, to Winter in Russia, and then she came from the Island 121
Vaigats, being forcibly driven from thence with an Easterly winde and yce, and so she came into the river Dwina, and arrived at Colmogro the 11 of September, 56. If the yce had not bene so much that yere as it was in the Streights, on both sides of the Island Vaigats, they in the said pinnesse would that yeere have discovered the parts that you are now sent to seeke: which thing (if it had pleased God) might have bene done then : but God hath reserved it for some other. Which discoverie, if it may be made by you, it shall not only prove profitable unto you, but it will also purchase perpetuali fame and renowme both to you and our countrey. And thus not doubting of your willing desires, and forwardnesse towards the same, we pray God to blesse you with a lucky beginning, fortunate successe, and happily to end the same. Amen.
