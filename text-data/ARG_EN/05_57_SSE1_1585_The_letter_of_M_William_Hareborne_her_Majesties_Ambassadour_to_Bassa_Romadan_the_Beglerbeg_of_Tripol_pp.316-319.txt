A letter of Master William Hareborne, the English Ambassadour, Ligier in Constantinople, to the Bassa Romadan, the Beglerbeg of Tripolis in Barbarie, for the restoring of an English shippe called the Jesus, with the goods, and men, detained as slaves, Anno 1585-{n}317{n}[II. i. 194.]{n}Right honourable Lord, it hath bene signified unto us by divers letters, what hath fallen out, concerning a certaine shippe of ours, called the Jesus, into which, for the helpe of Richard Skegs, one of our Marchants in the same, nowe deceased, there was admitted a certaine Frenchman called Romaine Sonnings, which for his ill behaviour, according to his deserts, seeking to cary away with him another Frenchman, which was indebted to certaine of your people, without paying his cteditours, was hanged by sentence of justice, together with Andrew Dier, the Master of the said ship, who simply and without fraude, giving credite to the said Frenchman, without any knowledge of his evil fact, did not returne when hee was commaunded, by your honourable Lordship. The death of the said lewde Frenchman we approove as a thing well done, but contrarywise, whereas your Lordship hath confiscated the said ship with the goods therein, and hath made slaves of the Mariners, as a thing altogether contrary to the privileges of the Grand Signior, granted foure yeeres since, and confirmed by us on the behalfe of the most excellent the Queenes Majestie of England our Mystresse, and altogether contrary to the league of the saide Grand Signior, who being fully informed of the aforesaid cause, hath granted unto us his royall commandement of restitution, which we send unto your honourable Lordship, by the present bearer Edward Barton our Secretarie, and Mahomet Beg, one of the Justices of his stately Court, with other letters of the most excellent Admirall, and most valiant Captaine of the Sea, requiring your honourable Lordship, as well on the behalfe of the Grand Signior, as of the Queenes most excellent Majestie my Mystresse, that the men, oyles, shippe, furniture, money, and all other goods whatsoever, by your Lordship, and your order taken from our men, be restored unto this my Secretary freely, without delay, as the Grand Signior of his goodnesse hath graunted 318{n}unto us, especially in regard that the same oyles were bought by the commaundement of our Queenes most excellent Majestie, for the provision of her Court. Which if you performe not, wee protest by these our leters against you, that you are the cause of all the inconveniences which may ensue upon this occasion, as the authour thereof, contrary to the holy league sworne by both our Princes, as by the privileges, which this our servant will shewe you, may appeare. For the seeing of which league performed, wee remaine here as Ligier in this stately Court. And by this meanes you shall answere in another world unto God alone, and in this world unto the Grand Signior, for this hainous sinne committed by you against so many poore soules, which by this your cruelty are in part dead, and in part detained by you in most miserable captivitie. Contrarywise, if it shall please you to avoyd this mischiefe, and to remaine in the favour of Almighty God, and of our Princes, you shall friendly fulfill this our just demaund (as it behoveth you to shew your selfe a prudent Governour, and faitbfull servant unto your Lord) and the same may turne to your great honour, and profite, by the trade of marchandize, which our men in time to come, may use in that government of yours: which generally, as well those poore men, as all others, which you shall meete at the sea, ought to be according to the commandement of the Grand Signior, friendly entertained and received of your honourable Lordship, and we will not fade in the dueties of a speciali friend, whensoever you shal have occasion to use us, as we desire. Almighty God grant unto your Lordship (in the fulfilling of this our just request, whereby wee may be delivered from further trouble in this matter, and your selfe from further displeasure) all true felicitie, and increase of honour.{n}Given in our Pallace from Rapamat in Pera, the 15. of Januarie 1585.{n}.
