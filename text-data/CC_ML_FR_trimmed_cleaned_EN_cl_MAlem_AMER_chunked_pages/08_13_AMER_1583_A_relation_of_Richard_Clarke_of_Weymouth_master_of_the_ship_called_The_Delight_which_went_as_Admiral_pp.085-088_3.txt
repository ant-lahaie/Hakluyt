spruce tree , fourteen of our man bring out of new fund land in a ship of saint John the lui , . fir , and very great birch tree . where we come on land we make a little house with bough , where we rest all that night . in the morning i divide the company three and three to go every way to see what food they can find to sustain themselves , and appoint they to meet there all again at noon with such food as they can get . as we go aboard we find great store of peason as good as any we have in England : a man will think they have be sow there . we rest there three day and three night and live very well with pease and berry , we name the place saint Laurence , because it be a very goodly river like the river of saint Laurence in Canada , and we find it very full of salmon . when we have well rest our self we row our boat along the shore , think to have go to the grande bay to have come home with some Spaniard which be yearly there to kill the whale : and when we be hungry or a thirst we put our boat on land and gather pease and berry . thus we row our boat along the shore five day : about which time we come to a very goodly river that run far up into the country and see very goodly grow tree of all sort . there we happen upon a ship of saint John de Luz , which ship bring we into Biskay to a harbour call the passage . the master of the ship be our great friend , or else we have be put to death if he have not keep our counsel . for when the visitor come aboard , as it be the order in Spain , they demand what we be , he say we be poor fisherman that have cast away our ship in newfound land , and so the visitor inquire no more of the matter at that time . assoon as night be come he put we on land and bid we shift for our self . then have we but ten or twelve mile into France , which we go that night , and then care not for the Spaniard . and so short after we come into England towards the end of the year 1583 .
