gulf : notwithstanding desirous to know the full certainty i proceed , and in 68 degree the passage enlarge , so that i can not see the western shore : thus i continue to the latitude of 73 degree , in a great sea , free from ice , coast the western shore of desolation : the people come continual row out unto i in their canoas , twenty , forty , and one hundred at a time , and will give i fish dry , salmon , salmon peal , cod , caplin , lump , stone - base and such like , beside diverse kind of bird , as partridge , pheasant , gull , sea bird and other kind of flesh : i still labour by sign to know from they what they know of any sea towards the north , they still make sign of a great sea as we understand they , than i depart from that coast , think to discover the north part of America : and after i have sail towards the west 40 league , i fall upon a great bank of ice : the wind be north and blue much , i be constrain to coast the same towards the south , not see any shore west from i , neither be there any ice towards the north , but a great sea , free , large very salt and blue , and of a unsearchable depth : so coast towards the south i come to the place where i leave the ship to fish , but find they not . then be forsake and leave in this distress refer my self to the merciful providence of God , i shape my course for England , and unhoped for of any , God alone relieve i , i arrive at Dartmouth . by this last discovery it seem most manifest that the passage be free and without impediment towards the north : but by reason of the spanish fleet and unfortunate time of m . secretary death , the voyage be omit and never since attempt . the cause why i use this particular relation of all my proceed for this discovery , be to stay this objection , why have not Davis discover this passage be thrice that way employ ? how far i proceed and in what form this discovery lie , do appear upon the globe which m . Sanderson to his very great charge have publish , for the which he deserve great favour and commendation .
