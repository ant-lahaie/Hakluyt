not habitable . to all which objection may be answer in this manner : first , that though the sun be absent from they those six month , yet it follow not that there shall be such extreme darkness ; for as the sun be depart under their horizon , so be it not far from they : and not so soon as the sun fall so sudden come the dark night ; but the evening do substitute and prolong the day a good while after by twilight . after which time the residue of the night receive light of the moon and star , until the break of the day , which give also a certain light before the sun rise ; so that by these mean the night be seidome dark ; which be verify in all part of the world , but least in the middle zone under the equinoctial , where the twilight be short , and the night dark than in any other place , because the sun go under their horizon so deep , even to their antipode . we see in England in the summer night , when the sun go not far under the horizon , , that by the light of the moon and star we may travel all night , and if occasion be , do some other labour also . and there be no man that doubt whither our cattle can see to feed in the night , see we be so well certify thereof by our experience : and by reason of the sphere our night shall be dark than any time under the pole . the astronomer consent that the sun descend 274 from our upper hemisphere at the 18 parallel under the horizon make a end of twilight , so that at length the dark night ensue , and that afterward in the morning the sun approach again within as many parallel , do drive away the night by access of the twilight . again , by the position of the sphere under the pole , the horizon , and the equinoctial be all one .
