merry with my old Portugal : companion ) i say , do come on shore when i command capernas . they in the name of the 5 . port , and conjure they by such like word : these also be the fish which i may sweep with broom on a heap , and never wet my foot , only pronounce two or three word whatsoever they be appoint by any man , so they hear my voice : the virtue of the word be small , but the nature of the fish great and strange . for the squid , who nature be to come by night as well as by day , i tell they , i set he a candle to see his way , with which he be much delight , or else come to wonder at it as doe our fresh water fish , the other come also in the night , but chief in the day , be force by the cod that will devour he , and therefore for fear come so near the shore , be drive dry by the surge of the sea on the pibble and sand . of these be as good as a smell you may take up with a shove - net as plentiful as you do wheat in a shovel , sufficient in three or four hour for a whole city . there be also other fish which i tell those that be desirous of strange news , that i take as fast as one will gather up stone , and they i take with a long pole and hook . yea marry say they , we believe so , and that you catch all the rest you bring home in that sort , from Portugal and Frenchman . no sure , but thus i do : with three hook stretch forth in the end of a pole , i make as it be a eel spear , with which i prick those flounder as fast as you will take up fritter with a sharp point stick , and with that tool i may take up in less than half a day lobster sufficient to find three hundred man for a day meat . this pastime end , i show they that for my pleasure i take a great mastive i have , and
