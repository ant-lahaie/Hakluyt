come all aboard together , cry , entrad , entrad : but our man receive they so hot , with small shot and pike , that they kill they like dog . and thus they continue aboard they almost a quarter of a hour , think to have devour our man , pinnace and all . and sure to man judgement , no other thing be likely in regard of their great number , and the fewness of our man , and they at the first think all be their own : but God , who be the giver of all victory , so bless our small company , and so strengthen their arm and mind to fight , that the enemy have receive a mighty foil , be glad to rid himself from their hand : and whereas at their marvellous entrance , we esteem they to be no less than betwixt two hundred and three hundred man in the afewofour galley , we can scarce perceive twenty man at their man . departure stand on their leg , but the great part of they be slay , many deadly wound , their oar break , and she depart from our man , hang upon one side ( as a sow that have lose her left ear ) with 219 above 360 Portugal and Indians slay . the number of dead and wound man that lie one upon another . and whereas their come aboard be in a great bravado , with drum , shout , and cry , they depart without either noise of drum or speech . we lose in this conflict of our man , three only , which be Alexander the master Gunners mate , Laurence Gambrel , a proper young man of Hampton , and another that be master benman man . some also be hurt with the arrow of the enemy , but the wound be curable : and thus it please Almighty God , of his great goodness , to give victory to 50 or 60 Englishman , against six or seven hundred Portugal and Indians , for which we cease not to give such dutiful thank to
