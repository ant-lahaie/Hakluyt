A commandment to the Byes , and Cadies of Metelin and Rhodes , and to all the Cadies and Byes in the way to Constantinople . 
 TO the Sanjakbies of Rhodes and Metelin , to the Sanjacbies bordering on the seacoast , and to the Cadies in Rhodes and Metelin , and to the Ermins in the other ports and coasts . This commandment coming to you , know that the Ambassador of England required of us our commandment that their ships coming to Chio , & from thence to Constantinople , no man should hurt them or offer any violence , either in the way on the sea or on the land , or in the ports . I have commanded , that their ships coming to any of the said places or ports with merchandise , if they themselves will , they may fell their commodities , & as much , and as Title as they will , and if it be in a place where custom was not wont to be taken , having taken the custom due by the old Canon you suffer them not to be injuried , either in the way , ports , or other places , but that they may come in quietness to Constantinople , and certify us of those that be disobedient to our commandment , and give credit to our seal . And having read this our commandment , give it to them again .
