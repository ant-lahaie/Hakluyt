The travails of Robert Curson . 
 The same in English . 
 RObert Curson descended of a noble family of England , used great diligence aswell in profane as in divine studies in the famous University of Oxford ( as I conjecture . ) He had there the best schoolmasters that were to be got , and was most industrious in the arts and continual exercises of learning : by means whereof he grew to be of great renown where he lived . Afterwards thinking of greater matters he went to Paris , and thence to Room it self , and at Paris he proceeded doctor of Divinity , at Room he was made cardinali : whereupon both Matthew Paris & Matthew of Westminster produce this testimony of him , the one in his second book , the other in his eight book of Chronicles . In the year of our Lord ( say they ) 1218 , at the taking of Damiata a city of Egypt under John Bren king of Jerusalem , M. Robert Curson and English man , a most famous clerk of noble parentage , and cardinali of the church of Room , was there with Pelagius Albanensis , etc. Boston of Bury in SufFolke in his catalogue reporteth , that he wrote diverse books . He flourished in the year aforesaid by the witnesses aforesaid . Henry the third son of king John being then king of England : and by the further testimony of Boston , this Curson was legate into England in the days of Honorious the third , bishop of Rome .
