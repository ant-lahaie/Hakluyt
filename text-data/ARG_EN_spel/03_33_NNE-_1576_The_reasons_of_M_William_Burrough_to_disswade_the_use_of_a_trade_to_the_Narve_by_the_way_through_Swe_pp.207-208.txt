Certain reasons to dissuade the use of a trade to the Narve aforesaid , by way through Sweden . 
 THe merchandise of the Narve are gross wares , viz. flax , hemp , wax , tallow and hides . 
 The traffic at that place stands upon the agreement and liking of the Emperor of Russia , with the king of Sweden : for all these merchandises that are brought thither come from Plescove , Novogrod , and other parts of the Emperors dominions . 
 For transporting those merchandises from Narve to Stockholm , or what other place shall be thought convenient in Sweden , it must be in vessels of those countries , which will of small force to resist Freebooters , or any other that shall make quarrel or offer violence against them . 
 When the goods are brought into Sweden , they must be discharged , and new laden into smaller vessels , to carry the same by river or lake a part of the way , and again to be unladen and transported by land to Newles . 
 So as the ordinary charges for transporting of goods from Narve to Newles by way as aforesaid , beside the spoil by so often lading and unlading , carriage by land , and the dangers of the seas , pirates , etc. will be such as when it shall so brought to Newles it will be as deer to the merchant's in that place as it shall be worth to be sold in London , wherefore the trade that ways cannot be profitable to our nation . 
 Moreover , when the goods shall be in Newles , it may Note . be thought doubtful to bring it thence quietly without disliking or forcible resistance of the king of Denmarke , forasmuch as he makes quarrel , and allegeth damage unto him in his toils of the Found by our trade to S. Nicholas , how much more will he now do by this way , and with how much greater advantage may he

 perform it ? The danger that may grow in our trade to Russia by way of S. Nicholas , through the displeasure that the Emperor may conceive by our trade with the Sweden to Narve is also to be considered .
