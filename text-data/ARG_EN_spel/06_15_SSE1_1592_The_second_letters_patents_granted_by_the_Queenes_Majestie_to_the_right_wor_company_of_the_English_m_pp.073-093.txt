 Per breve de privato Sigillo . 
 Bailie . 
 To the Worshipful and his very loving Uncle M. Rowland Hewish Esquire , at Sand in Devonshire . 
 Ir , considering the goodness of your Nature which is wont kindly to accept from a friend , even of mean things being given with a good heart , I have presumed to trouble you with the reading of this rude discourse of my travails into Turkey , and of the delivery of the 
 present with such other occurrents as there happened worthy the observation : of all which proceedings I was and eyewitness , it pleasing the Ambassador to take me in with him to the Grand Signior . If for lack of time to put it in order I have not performed it so well as it ought , I crave pardon , assuring you that to my knowledge I have not missed in the truth of any thing . If you ask me what in my travels I have learned , I answer as a noble man of France did to the like demand , Hoc unum didici , mundi contemptum : and so concluding with the wise man in the book of the Preacher , that all is vanity , and one thing only is necessary , I take my leave and commit you to the Almighty . From London the 16. March 1597. 
 Your loving Nephew 
 Richard Wrag .
