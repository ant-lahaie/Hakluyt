 Empire the only and highest Monarch above all , health , and many happy and fortunate years , with great abundance of the best things . 
 Most noble and puissant'Emperour , about two years now passed , we wrote unto your Imperial ! Majesty , that our well-beloved servant , William Hareborne , a man of great reputation and honour , might be received under your high authority , for our Ambassador in Constantinople , and other places , under the obedience of your Empire of Musulman : And also that the Englishmen , being our Subject's , might exercise intercourse and merchandise in all those Provinces , no less freely then the French , Polonians , Venetians , Germane , and other your confederates , which travel through diverse of the East parts : endeavouring that by mutual traffic , the East may be joined and knit to the West . 
 Which privileges , when as your most puissant Majesty , by your letters and under your dispensation most liberally and favourably granted to our Subject's of England , we could not less doe , but in that respect give you as great thanks , as our heart could conceive , trusting that it will come to pass , that this order of traffic , so well ordained , will bring with it self most great profits and commodities to both sides , as well to the parties subject to your Empire , as to the Provinces of our kingdom .. Which thing that it may be done in plain and effectual manner , whereas some of our Subject's of late at Tripolis in Barbarie , and at Argier , were by the inhabitants of those places ( being perhaps ignorant of your pleasure ) evil entreated and grievously vexed , we do friendly and lovingly desire your Imperiali Majesty , that you will understand their causes by our Ambassador , and afterwards give commandment to the Lieutenants and Presidents of those Provinces , that our people may henceforth freely , without any violence , or injury , travel , and do their business in those places . 
 And we again with all endeavour , shall study to perform all those things , which we shall in any wise 313
