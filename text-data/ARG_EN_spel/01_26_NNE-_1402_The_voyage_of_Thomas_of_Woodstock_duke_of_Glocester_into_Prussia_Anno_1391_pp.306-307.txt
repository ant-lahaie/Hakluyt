The voyage of Thomas of Woodstocke Duke of Glocester into Prussia , in the year 1391. written by Thomas Walsingham . 
 Reditus . 
 The same in English . 
 AT the same time the Duke of Glocester Lord Thomas of Woodstock ( the youngest son of Edward the third ) to the great grief of many , took his journey towards Prussia : whom neither the Londoners mones nor yet the lamentation of the commonalty could restrain from his intended expedition . For the common people both of the City and of the country feared lest in his absence some new calamity might happen ; which they feared not while he was present . For in him the whole nation seemed to repose their hope and comfort . Howbeit having scarce passed as yet the bounds of his own 306 
 country , he was immediately by hard fortune tossed up and down with dangerous storms and tempests , and was brought into such distress , that he despaired even of his own life . At length , having not without danger of death , sailed along the coasts of Denmarke , Norway , and Scotland , he returned into Northumberland , and went to the castle of Tinmouth as unto a place of refuge known of old unto him : where , after he had refreshed himself a few days , he took his journey towards his Manor of Plashy , bringing great joy unto the whole kingdom , aswell in regard of his safety as of his return .
