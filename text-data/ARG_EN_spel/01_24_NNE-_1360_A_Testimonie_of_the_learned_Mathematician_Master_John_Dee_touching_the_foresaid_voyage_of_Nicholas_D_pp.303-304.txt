A Testimony of the learned Mathematician master John Dee , touching the foresaid voyage of Nicholas De Linna . 
 Nno 1360. ( that is to wit , in the 34. year of the reign of the triumphant king Edward the third ) a friar of Oxford , being a good Astronomer , went in company with others to the most Northern Islands of the world , and there leaving his company together , he travailed alone , and 
 purposely described all the Northern Islands , with the indrawing seas : and the record thereof at his return he delivered to the king of England . The name of which book is Inventio Fortunata ( aliter fortunae ) qui liber Inventio incipit a gradu 54. usque ad polum . Which friar for ^ Â» rtunata-sundry purposes after that did five times pass from England thither , and home again . 
 It is to be noted , that from the haven of Linne in Norfolke ( whereof the foresaid Francisan friar took his 303 
 name ) to Island , it is not above a fortnights sailing with and ordinary wind , and hath be of many years a very common and usual trade : which further appears by the privileges granted to the Fishermen of the town of Blacknie in the said County of Norfolke , by king Edward the third , for their exemption and freedom from his ordinary service , in respect of their trade to Island .
