A letter written from the Queens Majesty , to Zelabdim Echebar , King of Cambaia , and sent by John Newbery . In February Anno 1583. 
 Lizabeth by the grace of God , etc. To the most invincible , and most mighty prince , lord Zelabdim Echebar king of Cambaya . Invincible Emperor , etc. The great affection which our Subject's have , to visit the most distant places of the world , not without good will and in - 
 tention to introduce the trade of merchandise of all nations whatsoever they can , by which means the mutual and friendly traffic of merchandise on both sides may come , is the cause that the bearer of this letter John Newbery , jointly with those that be in his company , with a courteous and honest boldness , do repair to the borders and countries' of your Empire , we doubt not but that your imperial Majesty through your royal grace , will favourably and friendly accept him . And that you would do it the rather for our sake , to make us greatly beholding to your Majesty ; we should more earnestly , and with more words require it , if we did think it needful . But by the singular report that is of your imperial Majesties humanity in these uttermost parts of the world , we are greatly eased of that burden , and therefore we use the fewer and less words : only we request that because they are our subject's , they may be honestly entreated and received . And that in respect of the hard journey which they have undertaken to places so far distant , it would please your Majesty with 45Â° 
 some liberty and seen ri tie of voyage to gratify it , with such privileges as to you shall seem good : which courtesy if your Imperiali majesty shall to our subject's at our requests perform , we , according to our royal honour , will recompense the same with as many deserts as we can . And herewith we bid your Imperial Majesty to farewell .
