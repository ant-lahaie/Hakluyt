 Whereas our sister Queen Elizabeth , by the grace of God , Queen of England , France and Ireland , hath written to us her letters , that we would grant her merchant's , William Gerrard , William Chester , Rowland Heyward , Lawrence Hussie , John Marsh , Anthony Jenkinson , William Rowly , and their company of England , to come in ships into this kingdom , and those merchant's , William Gerrard and his company have required of us that we would grant and licence them to come into our country of Dwina , with all kind of wares at will , to our City of Mosco , and to all our castles in our kingdoms , we for our sisters sake Elizabeth , by the grace of God , Queen of England , France and Ireland , have licenced her merchant's , William Gerrard and his company to pass in ships to [ I . our kingdom of Colmogro , and to the land of Dwina , and to all other our inheritances in the North parts , with all kind of wares to our city of Mosco , and to all castles and towns in our kingdom . And sir William Garrard & his company desired of us , that we would grant them licence to pass to our inheritance of Cazan and Astracan , and into our inheritance of Novogrod the great , and to our inheritance of Lifland to Narve and Dorpe , and to other our castles and 
 93 
 373 ] 
 towns of Lifland , with all kind of wares , and the trade to be without custom , which request we have granted to sir William Garrard and his company , and have given them licence to pass to our inheritance of Cazan and Astracan , and Novgorod the great , and into our inheritance of Lifland , Narve and Dorpe , and other places of our inheritance in Lifland with all kind of wares , to buy , barter and fell at will , without custom : and what wares soever they bring out of England , or out of any other country , needful or necessary , that they shall bring all those wares needful or necessary to our treasury , & those wares there to be opened , and then to take out of the same , such wares as shall needful for our treasury , and the rest being delivered again , to fell and barter at their pleasure , and to fell none of the fine wares before they be seen by our chancellors , except sorting clothes , and other wares not meet for our treasury : and when our chancellor will send our treasure out of our treasury with them , they shall take it with them , and so fell and barter it for wares meet for our treasury , and bring it to our treasury , and they to take no other men's wares to barter or fell with them , nor yet our people to buy or fell for them their wares : and if those English merchant's do desire to pass out of our kingdom of Astracan to Boghar , Shamaky , Chaday , or into any other countries' , or else to go into their own country , then they to take their treasure with them , and to barter and fell it for wares necessary for our treasury , and to bring it and deliver it to our chancellor , and when they come back again to our inheritance of Cazan and Astracan , or to any other of our castles and towns , that then our captain of Cazan and Astracan , and all other our people of charge shall not hold them , but with speed let them pass without taking custom of them or their wares , and without opening or looking upon them in any wise : and when they have not our treasure with them , that then likewise no custom 
 shall taken of them nor their wares to be seen of any man . 
 And likewise we have granted them to buy and fell in all our kingdoms and castles , with all kind of wares : and we have also licenced them , that when those English merchant's do desire to buy & fell with our merchant's wholly together , that they shall have liberty so to do wholly together : and they that do desire to fell their own wares by retail in their own house , that then they fell it in their own house by retail to our people & other strangers , as they can agree : and weights and arshnids to be kept in their house with our seal , and they themselves to barter and fell their own wares : and no Russe merchant in Mosco , or any other place in our kingdom to fell for them any wares , nor to buy or barter any wares for them , nor colour any strangers goods . And whereas those merchant's of England , sir William Garrard and his company do desire to fell their wares at Colmogro , Dwina , Vologda , Yeraslave , Costrum , and in Novogrod the lower , Cazan , Astracan , great Novgorod , Plesko , Narve , Dorpe , and in other our towns & castles , they shall have their will to fell it : and of their wares of England and Russeland no custom shall taken , neither they nor their wares shall stayed in any place : and when they depart out of Mosco , to advertise our chancellor thereof , and not to give any note or inventory of any kind of their wares they carry away : and when the English merchant's , sir William Garrard and his company do come upon the sea , and by misfortune have their ships cast away upon those coasts of the North parts , then we will their goods to be sought out with truth , and to be delivered to sir William Garrard and his company , which as then shall be found in our country : and if that sir William Garrards company be not in the Mosco nor in our country , then we will and command that those goods of theirs shall be laid up in a place of safeguard until such time as the said sir William Garrard or his 
 company come to demand the same : and then at their coming we will that it shall be delivered . And whereas heretofore we have given sir William Garrard and his company in this our kingdom of Mosco the new castle by the church of S. Maxim behind the market , they shall there still hold their house as heretofore we have given them , paying no custom for the same : and we also do licence them to keep one Russe porter or two , or else of their own country , and those porters shall dwell with them , and not fell for them , nor barter , nor buy for them : And also I have granted them to buy a house at Vologda and at Colmogro , or in any other place where they can choose for themselves any good harbour , and there they to set up those houses in those places at their own charges : and in Vologda or the other houses to keep two or three porters of their own , or else two or three Russes , and their wares to be laid up in those houses , and to fell their own wares at will : and the porters without them to fell none of their wares , neither yet to buy any for them . And our officers of Colmogro and Dwina , and of other our castles & towns shall not look over their wares , nor take any custom thereof : neither shall those English merchant's sir William Garrard and his company be judged by any of them . And when the English merchant's shall send from our kingdom their own people into their own country by land over other kingdoms whatsoever the be , they may without ware send their own people at their pleasure . And when any matter of law does fallen out in their trade of merchandise , then they shall be judged by our chancellors , and law shall done with equity betwixt our people and them : and when they cannot be judged by law , they then shall Trial ! by lots , tried by lots , and whose lot is first taken out , he shall have the right . And if it happen any of those merchant's to have any matter of law in any other part of our dominions for trade of merchant's , then our captains , judges , and chief officers shall hear the matter , and 96 
 administer justice with equity and truth , and where law can take no place , to be tried by lots , and his lot that is first taken out to have the right , and for their matters of law no custom to be paid . 
 Furthermore , we for our sisters sake Elizabeth have granted , that none beside sir William Garrard and his company , out of what kingdom soever it be , England or other , shall not come in trade of merchandise nor otherwise to Colmogro , nor to the river Ob , nor within Wardhouse , nor to Petzora , nor Cola , nor Mezen , nor to the abbey of Petchingo , nor to the Island of Shallawy , nor to any mouth of the river of Dwina , nor to any part of the North country of our coast . And if any merchant , out of what country soever it be , do come with ship or ships , busses , or any other kind of vessel to any of our harbours , within all our North parts , we will that then the people and goods , ship or ships , shall confiscate , and forfeited to us the Emperor and great Duke .
