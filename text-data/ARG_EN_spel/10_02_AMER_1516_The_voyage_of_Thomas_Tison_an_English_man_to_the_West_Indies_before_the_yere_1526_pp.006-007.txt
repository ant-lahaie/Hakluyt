A brief note concerning a voyage of one Thomas Tison and English man , made before the year 1526. to the West Indies , & of his abided there in manner of a secret factor for some English merchants , which under hand had trade thither in those days : taken out of and old ligier-booke of M. Nicolas Thorne the elder , a worshipful merchant of Bristol . 
 TO appears out of a certain note or letter of remembrance , in the custody of me Richard Hakluyt , written 1526. by master Nicolas Thorne the elder , a principali merchant of Bristol , unto his friend and factor Thomas Midnail , and his servant William Ballard at that time 
 remaining at S. Lucar in Andaluzia : that before the said year one Thomas Tison and Englishman had found the way to the West Indies , and was there resident : unto whom the aforesaid M. Nicolas Thorne sent armour and other commodities specified in the letter aforesaid . This Thomas Tison ( so far as I can conjecture ) may 
 seem to have be some secret factor for M. Thorn and other English merchants in those remote parts ; whereby it is probable that some of our merchants had a kind of trade to the West Indies even in those ancient times and before also : neither do I see any reason why the Spaniards should debar us from it at this present .
