And Act for the corporation of Merchant's adventurers for the discovering of new trades , made in the eight year of Queen Elizabeth . Anno 1566. 
 Hereas diverse very good Subject's of this Realm of England in the latter end of the reign of the late right high and mighty prince our Sovereign Lord king Edward the sixt , at the gracious encouragement , and right good liking of the said king , and by his Majesties 
 liberali example , did at their adventure , and to their exceeding great charges , for the glory of God , the honour and increase of the revenues of the Crown , and the common utility of the whole Realm of England , set forth three ships for the discovery by Sea , of Isles , lands , territories , dominions , and Signory unknown , and by the Subject's of the said late king not commonly by seas frequented : and after that Almighty God had called to 
 his mercy the said king , who died before the finishing and sealing of his most ample and gracious letters of privileges promised to the said Subject's , as well in consideration of the said enterprise , as for diverse other respects it pleased our late sovereign Q. Marry , at the humble suits of the same subject's , to grant by her letters Patents under the great Seal of England , bearing date at Westminster the 26. day of February , in the second year of her reign , for the considerations mentioned in the said letters Patents , to the said subject's being specially nam in the said letters Patents , and to their successors , that they by the name of Merchant's adventurers of England , for the discovery of lands , territories , Isles , dominions , and Signory unknown , and not before their late adventure or enterprise , by seas or Navigations commonly frequented , should be from thenceforth one body , and perpetual fellowship and commonalty of themselves , both in deed and in name , and that the same fellowship and commonalty from thenceforth should and might have one or two governors , foure Consuls , and 24. assistants , of the said fellowship and commonalty of Merchant's adventurers , and that they by the name of the Governor , Consuls , assistants , fellowship , and commonalty of Merchant's adventurers , for the discovery of lands , territories , Isles , dominions , and Signory unknown , by the seas and Navigations , and not before their said late adventure or enterprise , by Seas frequented , should or might be able in the law to implead and to be impleaded , to answer and to be answered , to defend and to be defended , before whatsoever Judge or Justice temporali or spiritual , or other persons whatsoever , in whatsoever court or courts , and in all actions , real , personal , and mixed , and in every of them , and in all plaints of Novel deseison , and also in all plaints , suits , quarrels , afiaires , business , and demands whatsoever they be , touching and concerning the said fellowship and commonalty , and the afiaires and business of the same , only in as ample manner and 
 form , as any other corporation of this Realm might do , giving also , and granting unto them by the said letters Patents , diverse authorities , powers , jurisdictions , preeminences , franchises , liberties and privileges , as by the same letters Patents more at large will appear . And among other things mentioned in the said letters Patents , whereas one of the three ships , by the said fellowship before that time set forth for the voyage of discovery aforesaid , nam the Edward Bonaventure , had arrived within the Empire and dominion of the high and mighty Prince Lord John Vasiliwich , Emperor of all Russia , Volodimersky , great duke of Musky , etc. who received the Captain and Merchant's of the said ship very graciously , granting unto them freely to traffic with his subject's in all kind of merchandizes , with diverse other gracious privileges and liberties : therefore the said late Queen by the same letters Patents , for her , her heirs and successors , did grant that all the main lands , Isles , ports , havens , creeks and rivers of the said mighty Emperor of all Russia , and great duke of Mosco , etc. and all and singular other lands , dominions , territories , Isles , ports , havens , creeks , rivers , arms of the seas , of all and every other Emperor , king , prince , ruler , or governor whatsoever he or they be , before the said late adventure or enterprise not known , or by the aforesaid merchant's and subject's of the said king and Queen , by the seas not commonly frequented , nor any part or parcel thereof , and lying Northwards , Northeastwards , or Northwestwards , as in the said letters patents is mentioned , should not be visited , frequented nor haunted by any the subject's of the said late Queen , other then of the said company and fellowship , and their successors , without express licence , agreement , & consent of the Governer , Consuls , and Assistants of the said fellowship , and commonalty , or the more part of them , in manner & form , as is expressed in the said letters patents , upon pain of forfeiture and loss aswell of the ship and ships , with 
 the appurtenances , as also of the goods , merchandizes , and things whatsoever they be , of those the subject's of the said late Queen not being of the said fellowship and commonalty , which should attempt or presume to sail to any of those places , which then were , or after should happen to be found and trafficked unto , the one half of the same forfeiture to be to the use of the said late Queen , her heirs & successors , and the other half to be to the use of the said fellowship & commonalty , as by the same letters patents more plainly will appear . 
 Since the making of which letters patens , the said fellowship have , to their exceeding great costs , losses and expenses , not only by their trading into the said dominions of the said mighty prince of Russia , etc. found out convenient way to sail into the said dominions : but also passing thorough the same , and over the Caspian sea , have discovered very commodious trades into Armenia , Media , Hyrcania , Persia , and other dominions in Asia minor , hoping by Gods grace to discover also the country of Cathaia , and other regions very convenient to be traded into by merchant's of this realm , for the great benefit and commodities of the same . 
 This is meant And forasmuch as diverse subject's of this realm , 5 understanding the premises , and perceiving that now 
 elder after the charge and travel aforesaid , diverse wares and 
 merchandizes are brought by the said fellowship into this Realm , out of the dominions already discovered , which be within this realm of good estimation , minding for their peculiar gain , utterly to decay the trade of the said Fellowship , have contrary to the tenor of the same letters patents , in great disorder traded into the dominions of the said mighty prince of Russia , etc. to the great detriment of this common wealth : And for that the name by which the said fellowship is incorporated by the letters patents aforesaid , is long , & consisteth of very many words : Therefore be it enacted by the Queens most excellent Majesty , the Lords 
 spiritual and temporal , & the commons in this present parliament assembled , and by authority of the same , that the said fellowship , company , society & corporation made or created by the said letters patents , shall at all time & times from henceforth be incorporated , nam and called only by the name of the fellowship of English merchant's , for discovery of new trades , and by English Mer-the same name for ever shall and may continue a nntsfirdis-perpetuall body incorporate in deed and name , and cies^ only by the same name from henceforth , shall implead , and be impleaded , answer and be answered , defend and be defended , sue and be sued , in whatsoever courts and places , and shall and may by the same name be enabled to purchase , have , hold , possess , retain , and enjoy whatsoever manors , lands , tenements , rends , reversions , services , & hereditaments not exceeding a hundred marks yearly , not being held of the Queens majesty , her heirs , or successors by knights service in Capite , and all goods , merchandizes , chattels , and other things whatsoever , and shall and may by the same name make and do all things as any other corporation 
 _ may do , and also shall have and enjoy all and singular the liberties , privileges , jurisdictions , franchises , preeminences , powers , authorities , and things , and may do and execute all other matters and things in the said letters patents mentioned , or in any wise contained . And that no part nor parcel of the main lands , Isles , ports , havens , roads , creeks , rivers , arms of the seas of any Emperor , king , prince , ruler or governor whatsoever he or they be , before the said first enterprise made by the merchant's of the said corporation , not known by the merchant's and subject's of this Realm , or by them not commonly by seas frequented , and lying from the City of London Northwards , Northwestwards , or Northeastwards , nor any part or parcel of the main lands , dominions , isles , ports , roads , havens , creeks , arms of the Seas , that now be subject to the said , high and mighty prince Lord John Vasiliwich , his heirs
