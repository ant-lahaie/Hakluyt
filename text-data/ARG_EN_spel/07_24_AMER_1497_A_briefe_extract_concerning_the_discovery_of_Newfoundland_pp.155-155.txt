A brief extract concerning the discovery of Newfoundland , taken out of the book of M. Robert Thorne , to doctor Leigh , etc. 
 Reason , that as some sicknesses are hereditary , so this inclination or desire of this discovery I inherited from my father , which with another merchant of Bristol nam Hugh Eliot , were the discoverers of the Newfound-lands ; of the which there is no doubt ( as now 
 plainly appears ) if the Mariners would then have be ruled , and followed their Pilots mind , but the lands of the West Indies , from whence all the gold comes , had be ours ; for all is one coast as by the Carded appears , and is aforesaid .
