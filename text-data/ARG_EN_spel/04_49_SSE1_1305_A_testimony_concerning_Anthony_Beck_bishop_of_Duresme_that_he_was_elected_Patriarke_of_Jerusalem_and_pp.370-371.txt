 The same in English . 
 ANthony Beck was bishop of Durisme in the time of the reign of Edward the first of that name after the invasion of William the great into England . This Anthony was elected patriarch of Jerusalem in the year of our Lord God 1305 , and was confirmed by Clement the fift , pope of Rome . He was of greater magnificence then for the calling of a bishop . He founded also the castle of Acheland foure miles from Durisme , on the shore of a pretty river called Unduglesme . He much beautified with new buildings Eltham manor being never unto Greenwich , and the castle Somaridune in the county of Lindsey . And lastly , he built new out of the ground the palace of London , which now is in the possession of prince Edward . Insomuch , that at length , through his over great magnificence and power he procured to himself great envy among the nobility , which he could not assuage during the rest of his life . But of this Anthony & of his writings we will speak more at large in our book entitled of the Britain bishops . This Anthony finished his life in the year of our Lord God 1310 , and in the reign of king Edward the second .
