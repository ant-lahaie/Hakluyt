 1017. 
 The same in English . 
 EDric counseled king Kanutus to murder the young princes Edward and Edmund the sons of King Edmund . But because it seemed a thing very dishonourable unto him to have them put to death in England , he sent them , after a short space , unto the king of Sweden to be slain . Who , albeit there was a league between them , would in no case con - 
 descend unto Canutus his bloody request , but sent them unto Salomon the king of Hungarie to be nourished and preserved alive . The one whereof namely Edmund in process of time there deceased . But Edward received to wife Agatha daughter unto the Germane Emperor Henry , of whom he begotten Margaret the Queen of the Scots , and Christina a Nun , and Clito Edgar .
