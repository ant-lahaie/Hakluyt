A notable historic containing foure voyages made by certain French Captains into Florida : Wherein the great riches and fruitfulness of the Country with the manners of the people hitherto concealed are brought to light , written all , saving the last , by Monsieur Laudonniere , who remained there himself as the French Kings Lieutenant a year and a quarter : 
 Translated out of French into English by M. 
 Richard Hakluyt . 
 To the right honourable Sir Walter Ralegh Knight , Captain of her Majesties Guard , Lord Warden of the Stanneries , and her Highness Lieutenant generail of the County of Cornwall , R. H. wishes true felicity . 
 Ir , after that this historic , 
 which had 
 be concealed many years , was lately committed to print and published in France under your Name by my learned friend M. Martine Basanier of Paris , I was easily induced to turn it into English , understanding that the same was no less grateful to you here , then I know it to be acceptable to many great and worthy persons there . 
 And no marvel though it were very welcome unto you , and that you liked of the translation thereof , since no history hitherto set forth hath more affinity , resemblance or conformity with yours of Virginia , then this of Florida . But calling to mind that you had spent more years in France then I , and understand the French better then my self , I forthwith perceived that you approved mine endeavour , not for any private ease or commodity that thereby might redound unto you , 
 439 
 Other men's misfortune ought to be our warning . 
 The chief things worthy observation in Florida are drawn in colours by James Morgues painter sometime living in the Black friars in London . 
 but that it argued a singular and especial care you had of those which are to be employed in your own like enterprise , whom , by the reading of this my translation , you would have forewarned and admonished aswell to beware of the gross negligence in providing of sufficiency of victuals , the security , disorders , and mutinies that fell out among the French , with the great inconveniences that thereupon ensued , that by others mishaps they might learn to prevent and avoid the like , as also might be put in mind , by the reading of the manifold commodities and great fertility of the places herein at large described and so near neighbours unto our Colonies , that they might generally be awaked and stirred up unto the diligent observation of every thing that might turn to the advancement of the actium , whereinto they are so cheerfully entered . Many speciali points concerning the commodities of these parts , the accidents of the French men's government therein , the causes of their good or bad success , with the occasions of the abandoning one of their forts , and the surprise of the other by the enemy are herein truly and faithfully recorded : Which because they be quoted by me in the margins , and reduced into a large alphabetical ! table , which I have annexed to the end of the work , it shall be needless to reckon up again . And that the rather , because the same with diverse other things of chiefest importance are lively drawn in colours at your no small charges by the skilful painter James Morgues , sometime living in the Black-fryers in London ( whom Monsieur Chastillion then Admiral of France sent thither with Laudonniere for that purpose ) which was and eyewitness of the goodness and fertility of those regions , and hath put down in writing many singularities which are not mentioned in this treatise : which since he hath published together with the purtraitures . These foure voyages I knew not to whom I might better offer then to your self , and that for diverse just considerations . First , for that as I have said before , they were dedicated 
 44® 
 unto you in French : secondly because now foure times also you have attempted the like upon the self same coast near adjoining : thirdly in that you have pierced as far up into the main and discovered no less secrets in the parts of your abode , then the French did in the places of their inhabiting lastly considering you are now also ready ( upon the late return of Captain Stafford and good news which he brought you of the safe arrival of your last Colony in their wished haven ) to prosecute this actium more thoroughly then ever . And here to speak somewhat of this your enterprise , I affirm , that if the same may speedily and effectually be pursued , it will prove far more beneficial in diverse respects unto this our realm , then the world , yea many of the wiser sort , have hitherto imagined . The particular commodities whereof are well collection of known unto your self and some few others , and are faithfully and with great judgement committed to writing , J ' as you are not ignorant , by one of your followers , which remained there about a twelvemonth with your worshipful Lieutenant M. Ralph Lane , in the diligent search of the secrets of those Countries' . Touching the speedy and effectual pursuing of your actium , though I wot well it would demand a princes purse to have it thoroughly followed without lingering , yet am I of opinion , that you shall draw the same before it be long to be profitable and gainful aswell to those of our nation there remaining , as to the merchant's of England that shall trade hereafter thither , partly by certain secret commodities already discovered by your servants , & partly by breeding of diverse sorts of beasts in those large and ample regions , and planting of such things in that warm climate as will best prosper there , and our realm stands most in need of . And this I find to have been the course that both the Spaniards and Portugals took in the beginnings of their discoveries & conquests . For the Spaniards at their first entrance into Hispaniola found neither sugar-canes nor ginger growing there , nor any kind of our cattle : But

 Kine , sugar - finding the place fit for pasture they sent kine & bulls and canes and sundry sorts of other profitable beasts thither , & trans-^rted^nto ' Ported the plants of sugar-canes , and set the roots of Hispaniola ginger : the hides of which oxen , with sugar and ginger , and Madera , are now the chief merchandise of that Island . The & c - Portugals also at their first footing in Madera , as John 
 Barros writes in his first Decade , found nothing there but mighty woods for timber , whereupon they called the Island by that name . Howbeit the climate being favourable , they enriched it by their own industry with the best wines and sugars in the world . The like manner of Wtad and proceeding they used in the Isles of the Azores by sowing 
 therein great quantity of Woad . So dealt they in S. ' Thomas under the Equinoctial , and in Brasil , and sundry other places . And if our men will follow their steps , by your wise direction I doubt not but in due time they shall reap no less commodi tie and benefit . Moreover there is none other likelihood but that her Majesty , which hath Christened , and given the name to your Virginia , if need require , will deal after the manner of honourable godmothers , which , seeing their gossips not fully able to bring up their children themselves , are wont to contribute to their honest education , the rather if they find any towardliness or reasonable hope of goodness in them . 
 Elizabeth Queen of Castile and Aragon , after her ^bethQueene ' husband Ferdinando and she had emptied their coffers and of Castile and exhausted their treasures in subduing the kingdom of Aragon in Granada and rooting the Moors , a wicked weed , out of advancing of Spayne , was nevertheless so zealous of Gods honour , " din^to ™ 5 ( as Fernand us Columbus the son of Christopher Gods glory . Columbus recordeth in the history of the deeds of his father ) she laid part of her own jewels , which she had in great account , to gage , to furnish his father forth upon his first voyage , before any foot of land of all the West Indies was discovered ; what may we expect of our most magnificent and gracious prince Elizabeth of England , into whose lap the Lord hath most plentifully thrown his treasures , what may we , I say , hope of her forward - 
 442 
 ness and bounty in advancing of this your most honourable enterprise , being far more certain then that of Columbus , at that time especially , and tending no less to the glory of God then that actium of the Spanyardes ? For as you may read in the very last words of the relation of New Mexico extant now in English , the main land , where your last Colony mean to seat themselves , is replenished with many thousands of Indians , Which are of better wits then those of Mexico and Theaptnesse Peru , as hath be found by those that have had some trial ! or them : whereby it may be gathered that they ofVirgmiato will easily embrace the Gospel , forsaking their idolatry , embrace wherein at this present for the most part they are wrapped Christiamtie . and entangled . A wise Philosopher noting the sundry Seneca . desires of diverse men , writeth , that if and ox be put into a meadow he will seek to fill his belly with grass , if a Stork be cast in she will seek for Snakes , if you turn in a Hound he will seek to start and Hare : So sundry men entering into these discoveries propose unto themselves several ends . Some seek authority and places of commandment , others experience by seeing of the world , the most part worldly and transitory gain , and that often times by dishonest and unlawful means , the fewest number the glory of God and the saving of the souls of the poor and blinded infidels . Yet because diverse honest and well disposed persons are entered already into this your business , and that I know you mean hereafter to send some such good Churchmen thither , as may truly say with the Apostle to the Savages , we z . Cor. 12.14 . seek not yours but you : I conceive great comfort of the success of this your actium , hoping that the Lord , whose power is wont to be perfected in weakness , will bless the feeble foundations of your building . Only be you Josue 1. 6. of a valiant courage and faint not , as the Lord said unto Josue , exhorting him to proceed on forward in the conquest of the land of promise , and remember that private men have happily wielded and waded through as great enterprises as this , with lesser means then those which 
 443 
 God in his mercy hath bountifully bestowed upon you , to the singular good , as I assure my self , of this our Common wealth wherein you live . Hereof we have The god sue - examples domestical and foreign . Remember I pray c*ssej y°u > what you find in the beginning of the Chronicle Stra^ow rd the conquest of Ireland newly dedicated unto your earleofChep - self . Read you not that Richard Strangbow the decayed stow . earl of Chepstow in Monmuthshire , being in no great favour of his sovereign , passed over into that Island in the year 1171. and accompanied only with certain of his private friends had in short space such prosperous success , that he opened the way for king Henry the second to the speedy subjection of all that warlike nation to this crown of England ? The like conquest of Brasilia , and annexing the same to the kingdom of Portugall was first begun by mean and private men , as DONE Antonio de Castillio , Ambassador here for that realm , and by office keeper of all the records and monuments of their discoveries , assured me in this city in the year 1581. Now if the greatness of the main of Virginia , and the large extension thereof , especially to the West , should make you think that the subduing of it , were a matter of more difficulty then the conquest of Ireland , first I answer , that as the late experience of that skilful ! The happy late pilot and Captain M. John Davis to the Northwest discoverieto ( towards which his discovery your self have thrice Captaine^ contributed with the forwardest ) hath showed a great part Davis . to be main sea , where before was thought to be main land , so for my part I am fully persuaded by Ortelius late reformation of Culvacan and the gulf of California , that the land on the back part of Virginia extendeth nothing so far westward as is put down in the Maps of those parts . Moreover it is not to be denied , but that one hundred men will do more now among the naked and unarmed people in Virginia , then one thousand were able then to do in Ireland against that armed and warlike nation in those days . I say further , that these two years last experience hath plainly showed , that we may spare 
 444 
 10000. able men without any miss . And these are as many as the kingdom of Portugal had ever in all their garrisons of the Azores , Madera , Arguin , Cape verde , Guinea , Brasill , Mozambique , Melinde , Zocotora , Ormus , Diu , Goa , Malaca , the Malucos , and Macao upon the coast of China . Yea this I say by the confession of singular expert men of their own nation ( whose names I suppress for certain causes ) which have be personally in the East Indies , & have assured me that their kings The hinge of had never above ten thousand natural born Portugals ( their slaves excepted ) out of their kingdom remaining ten thousand of in all the aforesaid territories . Which also this present their natural year I saw confirmed in a secret extract of the particular subject's in all estate of that kingdom and of every government and office subject to the same , with the several pensions there - ^ons ' unto belonging . Seeing therefore we are so far from want of people , that retiring daily home out of the Low Countries' they go idle up and down in swarms for lack of honest entertainment , I see no fitter place to employ some part of the better sort of them trained up thus long in service , then in the inward parts of the firm of Virginia against such stubborn Savages as shall refuse obedience to her Majesty . And doubtless many of our men will be glad and feign to accept this condition , when as by the reading of this present treaty they shall understand the fertility and riches of the regions confining so near upon yours , the great commodities and goodness whereof you have been contented to suffer to come to light . 
 In the mean season I humbly commend my self and this my translation unto you , and your self , and all those which under you have taken this enterprise in hand to the grace and good blessing of the Almighty , which is able to built farther , and to finish the good work which in these our days he hath begun by your most Christian and charitable endeavour . From London the 1. of May 1587.
