 HUbert Walter bishop of Sarisburie , a virtuous man , and famous for his good wit and piety , was one of the chiefest of them that followed king Richard into Syria going against the Saracens . As he returned from 346 
 Palaestina and came in his journey into Sicilia , he there herd of the ill fortune of the king being fallen into his enemies hands , and thereupon leaving his journey homeward , he went presently and in all haste to the place where the king was captived , whom the king immediately upon his coming sent into England , that by the authority of the council , a tribute might be collected for his redemption : which this Hubert performed with great diligence , and delivered the king . After this he was made Archbishop of Canterburie , and after the death of king Richard he showed the like duties of fidelity and trust to his brother John that succeeded him . For by a long oration he persuaded the whole nation of the English men , that Ke was a very circumspect man , virtuous , valiant , born of noble parentage , and most worthy of the crown . Whereupon he was so received of all the people and crowned king . He wrote certain books , and died at the last with very great grief of mind , in the year 1205 , having been archbishop the space of 11 years 8 months and sixe days , by reason of the civil discords abroad , whereby all things went topsy turvy , and in the reign of king John.
