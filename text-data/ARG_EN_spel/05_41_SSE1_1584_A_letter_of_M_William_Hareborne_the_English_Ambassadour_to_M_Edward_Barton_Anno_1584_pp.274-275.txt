A letter of the English ambassador to M. Edward Barton . 
 Aster Barton I send you 3. commandments in Turkish , with a copy thereof in English , to the end our ships might not come in danger of breach of league , if they should shoot at the galleys of those of Algier , Tunis , and Tripolis in the West : which after you 
 have showed the Bassas , receive again into your hands , and see them registered , and then deliver one of them to our friend M. Tipton , & the like you are to do with the privilege which you carry with you , and see them jointly registered in the Cadies book , delivering the copy of the said privilege sealed by the Cadi , also to the said our friend M. Tipton , taking a note of his hand for the receipt thereof , and for delivery at all times to us or our assigns . And require them in her majesties and the grand Signors name , that they will have our ships passing too and from under licence and safeconduct for recommended in friendly manner . Touching your proceedings in Tripolis with Romadan , as I have not received any advice thereof , since your departure , so must I leave you to God and my former direction . The ship patronised of Hassan Rays , which you wrote to be ours , proved to be a Catalonian . As for ours , by report of that Hassan and other Jewes in his ship , it was affirmed to be sold to the Malteses , which with the rest you are to receive there . And having ended these affairs and registered our privilege , and these three commandments , in Tripolis , Tunis , and Alger , I pray you make 274 
 speedy return , and for that which may be recovered , make over the same either to Richard Rowed for Patrasso in Morea , or otherwise hither to John Bore in the surest manner you may , if the registering of that your privilege and these commandments will not suffer you in person to return with the same . From my Mansion Rapamat in Pera this 24. of June 1584.
