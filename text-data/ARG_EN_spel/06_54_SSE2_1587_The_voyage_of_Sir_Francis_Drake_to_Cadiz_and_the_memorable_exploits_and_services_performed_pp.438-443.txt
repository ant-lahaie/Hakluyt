A brief relation of the notable service performed by Sir Francis Drake upon the Spanish Fleet prepared in the Road of Cadiz : and of his destroying of 100. sail of barks ; Passing from thence all along the coast to Cape Sacre , where also he took certain Forts : and so to the mouth of the River of Lisbon , and thence crossing over to the Isle of Sant Michael , supprized a mighty Carrack called the Sant Philip coming out of the East India , which was the first of that kind that ever was seen in England : Performed in the year 1587. 
 â€™Er Majesty being informed of a mighty 
 furnished with 
 preparation by Sea begun in Spaine for the invasion of England , by good advice of her grave and prudent Counsel thought it expedient to prevent the same . Whereupon she caused a Fleet of some 30. sails to be rigged and all things necessary . Over that Fleet 
 she appointed general sir Francis Drake ( of whose manifold former good services she had sufficient proof ) to whom she caused 4. ships of her Navy royal to be delivered , to wit , The Bonaventure wherein himself 
 went as General ; the Lion under the conduct of Master 
 William Borough Controller of the Navy ; the Dreadnought under the command of M. Thomas Venner ; and the Rainbow , captain whereof was M. Henry Bellingham : unto which 4 ships two of her pinasses were appointed as handmaids . There were also added unto this Fleet certain tall ships of the City of London , of whose especial good service the general made particular mention in his private Letters directed to her Majesty . This Fleet set sail from the found of 438 
 Plimouth in the month of April towards the coast of Spaine . 
 The 16. of the said month we met in the latitude of 40. degrees with two ships of Middleborough , which came from Cadiz ; by which we understood that there was great store of warlike provision at Cadiz & thereabouts ready to come for Lisbon . Upon this information our general with all speed possible , bending himself thither to cut off their said forces and provisions , upon the 19. of April entered with his Fleet into the Harbour of Cadiz : where at our first entering we were assailed over against the Town by sixe Galleys , which [ II ii . 122. ] notwithstanding in short time retired under their fortress . 
 There were in the Road 60. ships and diverse other small vessels under the fortress : there fled about 20. French ships to Port Real , and some small Spanish vessels that might pass the sholdes . At our first coming in we sunk with our shot a ship of Raguza of a 1000. tons , furnished with 40. pieces of brass and very richly laden . There came two Galleys more from S. Marry port , and two from Porto Real , which shot freely at us , but altogether in vain : for they went away with the blows well beaten for their pains . 
 Before night we had taken 30. of the said ships , & became Master's of the Road , in despite of the Galleys , which were glad to retire them under the Fort : in the number of which ships there was one new ship of and extraordinary hugeness in burden above 1200. tons , belonging to the Marquess of Santa Cruz being at that instant high Admiral of Spaine . Five of them were great ships of Biskay , whereof 4. we fired , as they were taking in the Kings provision of victuals for the furnishing of his Fleet at Lisbon : the fift being a ship about 1000. tons in burden , laden with Iron-spikes , nails , iron hoops , horseshoes , and other like necessaries bound for the West Indies we fired in like manner . Also we took a ship of 250. tons laden with wines 
 439 
 for the Kings provision , which we carried out to the Sea with us , and there discharged the said wines for our own store , and afterwards set her on fire . Moreover we took 3. Flyboats of 300 - tons a piece laden with biscuit , whereof one was half unladen by us in the Harbour , and there fired , and the other two we took in our company to the Sea. Likewise there were fired by us ten other ships which were laden with wine , raisins , figs , oils , wheat , & such like . To conclude , the whole number of ships and barks ( as we suppose ) then burned , sunk , and brought away with us , amounted to 30. at the least , being ( in our judgement ) about 10000. tons of shipping . 
 There were in sighed of us at Porto Real about 40. ships , beside those that fled from Cadiz . 
 We found little ease during our abode there , by reason of their continual shooting from the Galleys , the fortresses , and from the shore : where continually at places convenient they planted new ordinance to offend us with : beside the inconvenience which we suffered from their ships , which , when they could defend no longer , they set on fire to come among us . Whereupon when the flood came we were not a little troubled to defend us from their terrible fire , which nevertheless was a pleasant sighed for us to behold , because we were thereby eased of a great labour , which lay upon us day and night , in discharging the victuals , and other provisions of the enemy . Thus by the assistance of the Almighty , and the invincible courage and industry of our general , this strange and happy enterprise was achieved in one day and two nights , to the great astonishment of the King of Spaine , which bred such a corrasive in the heart of the Marks of Santa Cruz high Admiral of Spaine , that he never enjoyed good day after , but within few months ( as may justly be supposed ) died of extreme grief and sorrow . 
 Thus having performed this notable service , we came out of the Road of Cadiz on the Friday morning the 440 
 21. of the said month of April , with very small loss not worth the mentioning . 
 After our departure ten of the Galleys that were in the Road came out , as it were in disdain of us , to make some pastime with their ordinance , at which time the wind skanted upon us , whereupon we cast about again , and stood in with the shore , & came to anchor within a league of the town ; where the said Galleys , for all their former bragging , at length suffered us to ride quietly 
 We now have had experience of Galley-fight : wherein I can assure you , that only these 4. of her Majesties ships will make no account of 20. Galleys , if they may be alone , and not busied to guard others . There were never Galleys that had better place and fitter opportunity for their advantage to fight with ships : but they were still forced to retire , we riding in a narrow gut , the place yielding no better , and driven to maintain the same , until we had discharged and fired the ships , which could not conveniently be done but upon the flood , at which time they might drive clear off - us . Thus being victualed with bred and wine at the enemies cost for diverse months ( beside the provisions that we brought from home ) our general dispatched Captain Cross into England with his letters , giving him further in charge to declare unto her Majesty all the particularities of this our first enterprise . 
 After whose departure we shaped our course towards Cape Sacre , and in the way thither we took at several times of ships , barks , and Caravels well near and hundred , laden with hoops , galley-oars , pipe-staves , & other provisions of the king of Spaine , for the furnishing of his forces intended against England , all which we burned , having dealt favorably with the men and sent them on shore . We also spoiled and consumed all the fisher-boats and nets thereabouts , to their great hindrance : and ( as we suppose ) to the utter overthrow of the rich fishing of their Tunies for the same year . At length 
 441 
 A.D. 
 I587 - 
 The Carrack called the Sanct Philip taken . 
 we came to the aforesaid Cape Sacre , where we went on land ; and the better to enjoy the benefit of the place , and to ride in harbour at our pleasure , we assailed the same castle , and three other strong holds , which we took some by force and some by surrender . 
 Thence we came before the haven of Lisbon ankering never unto Cascais , where the Marks of Santa Cruz was with his Galleys , who seeing us chase his ships a shore , & take and carry away his barks and Caravels , was content to suffer us there quietly to tarry , and likewise to depart , and never charged us with one Canon-shot . And when our general sent him word that he was there ready to exchange certain bullets with him , the marks refused his challenge , sending him word , that he was not then ready for him , nor had any such Commission from his King . 
 Our general thus refused by the Marks , and seeing no more good to be done in this place , thought it convenient to spend no longer time upon this coast : and therefore with consent of the chief of his Company he shaped his course towards the Isles of the Azores , and passsing towards the Isle of Saint Michael , within 20. or 30. leagues thereof , it was his good fortune to meet with a Portugale Carrack called Sant Philip , being the same ship which in the voyage outward had carried the 3. Princes of Japan , that were in Europe , into the Indies . This Carrack without any great resistance he took , bestowing the people thereof in certain vessels well furnished with victuals , and sending them courteously home into their Country : and this was the first Carrack that ever was taken coming forth of the East Indies ; which the Portugals took for and evil sign , because the ship bore the Kings own name . 
 The riches of this prize seemed so great unto the whole Company ( as in truth it was ) that they assured themselves every man to have a sufficient reward for his travel : and thereupon they all resolved to return home for England : which they happily did , and arrived in 
 442 
 Plimouth the same Summer with their whole Fleet and this rich booty , to their own profit and due commendation , and to the great admiration of the whole kingdom . 
 And here by the way it is to be noted , that the taking of this Carrack wrought two extraordinary effects in England : first , that it taught others , that Carracks were no such bugs but that they might be taken ( as since indeed it hath fallen out in the taking of the Madre de Dios , and fyreing and sinking of others ) and secondly in acquainting the English Nation more generally with the particularities of the exceeding riches and wealth of the East Indies : whereby themselves and their neighbours of Holland have be encouraged , being men as skilful in Navigation and of no less courage then the Portugals to share with them in the East Indies : where their strength is nothing so great as heretofore hath be supposed .
