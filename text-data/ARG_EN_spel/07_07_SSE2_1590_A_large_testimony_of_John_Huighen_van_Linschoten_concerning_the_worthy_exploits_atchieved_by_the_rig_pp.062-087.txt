A large testimony of John Huighen van Linschoten Hollander , concerning the worthy exploits achieved by the right honourable the Earl of Cumberland , By Sir Martine Frobisher , Sir Richard Greenvile , and diverse other English Captains , about the Isles of the Azores , and upon the coasts of Spaine and Portugall , in the years 1589 , 1590 , 1591 , etc. recorded in his excellent discourse of voyages to the East and West Indies , cap . 96. 97. and 99. 
 He 22 of July 1589 about Evening , being by the Islands of Flores & Corvo , we perceived 3 ships that made towards us , which came from under the land , which put us in great fear : for they came close by our Admiral , and shot diverse times at him , and at another ship 
 of our company , whereby we perceived them to be Englishmen , for they bore and English flag upon their 62 
 LINSCHOTEN’S LARGE TESTIMONY a.d. 1589-91 . 
 main tops , but none of them showed to be above 60 tons in greatness . About Evening they followed after us , and all night boar lanterns with candles burning in them at their sternes , although the Moon shined . The same night passing hard by the Island of Fayal , the next day being between the Island of S. George that lay on our right hand , and the small Island called Graciosa on our left hand , we espied the 3 English ships still following us you took counsel together , whereof one sailed backwards , thinking that some other ship had come after us without company , & for a time was out of sighed , but it was not long before it came again to you other two , wherewith they took counsel & came all 3 together against our ship , because we lay in the lee of all our ships , & had you Island of S. George on the one side in stead of a sconce , thinking to deal so with us , that in you end we should be constrained to run upon the shore , whereof we wanted not much , and in that manner with their [ II ii . 179. ] flags openly displayed , came lustily towards us , sounding their Trumpets , and sailed at the least three times about us , beating us with Musket and Caliver , and some great pieces , and did us not hurt in the body of our ship , but spoiled all our sails and ropes , and to conclude , we were so plagued by them , that no man durst put forth his head , and when we shot off a piece , we had at the least and hours work to lade it again , whereby we had so great a noise and cry in the ship , as if we had all be cast away , whereat the English men themselves began to mock us , and with a thousand jesting words called unto us . In the mean time the other ships hoist all their sails , and did the best they could to sail to the Island of Tercera , not looking once behind them to help us , doubting they should come too late thither , not caring for us , but thinking themselves to have done sufficiently so they saved their own stakes , whereby it may easily be seen what company they keep one with the other , and what order is among them . In the end the English men perceiving small 
 advantage against us , ( little knowing in what case and fear we were , as also because we were not far from Tercera ) left us , which made us not a little to rejoice , as thinking our selves to be risen from death to life , although we were not well assured , neither yet void of fear till we lay in the road before Tercera , and under the safety of the Portingales fort , and that we might get thither in good time we made all the sails we could : on the other side we were in great doubt , because we knew not what they did in the Island , nor whither they were our friends or enemies , and we doubted so much the more , because we found no men of war nor any Carvels of advice from Portingal , as we made our accounts to do , that might convoy us from thence , or give us advice , as in that country ordinarily they use to do : and because the English - men had be so victorious in those parts , it made us suspect that it went not well with Spaine : they of the Island of Tercera were in no less fear then we , for seeing our fleet , they thought us to be Englishmen , and that we came to overrun the Island , because the 3. Englishmen had bound up their flags , and came in company with us : for the which cause the Island sent out two Carvels that lay there with advice from the king , for the Indians ships that should come thither . Those Carvels came to view us , and perceiving what we were , made after us , whereupon . the English ships left us , and made towards them , because the Carvels thought them to be friends , and shunned them not , as supposing them to be of our company , but we shot foure or five times and made signs unto them that they should make towards the Island , which they presently did . The Englishmen perceiving that , did put forward into the sea , & so the Carvels horded us telling us that the men of the Island were all in arms , as having received advice from Portugall , that Sir Francis Drake was in readiness , and would come unto those Islands . They likewise brought us news of the overthrow of the Spanish fleet before England , and that 
 the English men had be before the gates of Lisbon : whereupon the king gave us commandment that we should put into the Island of Tercera , and there lie under the safety of the Castle until we received further advice what we should do , or whither we should sail : for that they thought it too dangerous for us to go to Lisbon . Those news put our fleet in great fear , and made us look upon eke other not knowing what to say , as being dangerous for them to put into the road , because it lies open to the sea : so that the Indian ships , although they had express commandment from the king , yet they durst not anchor there , but only used to come thither , and to lie to and from , sending their boats on land to fetch such necessaries as they wanted , without ankering : but being by necessity compelled thereunto , as also by the kings commandment , and for that we understood the Earl of Cumberland not to be far from those Islands with certain ships of war , we made necessity a virtue , and entering the road , anchored close under the Castle , staying for advice and order from the king , to perform our voyage , it being then the 24. of July , and S. James day . 
 The day before the Earl of Cumberland with 6. or 7. ships of war , sailed by the Island of Tercera , and to their great good fortune passed out of sighed , so that they dispatched themselves in all haste , and for the more security , took with them 4. hundred Spaniards , of those that lay in Garrison in the Island , and with them they sailed towards Lisbon , having a good wind : so that within 11 days after they arrived in the river of Lisbon with great gladness & triumph : for if they had stayed but one day longer before they had entered the river , they had all been taken by Captain Drake , who with 40 ships came before Cascais at the same time that the Indian ships , cast anchor in the river of Lisbon , being guarded thither by diverse Galleys . 
 While I remained in Tercera , the Earl of Cumb. came to S. Marry , to take in fresh water , and some other 
 vii 65 E

 victuals : but the inhabitants would not suffer him to have it , but wounded both himself & diverse of his men , whereby they were forced to depart without having any thing there . 
 The Erle of Cumberland while I lay in Tercera , came unto the Isle of Graciosa , where himself in person , with seven or eight in his company went on land , asking [ II ii . 180. ] certain beasts , hens , and other victuals , with wine and fresh water , which they willingly gave him , and therewith he departed from thence , without doing them any hurt : for the which the inhabitants thanked him , and commended him for his courtesy , and keeping of his promise . 
 The same time that the Earl of Cumberland was in the Island of Graciosa , he came likewise to Fayall , where at the first time that he came , they began to resist him , but by reason of some controversy among them , they let him land , where he razed the Castle to the ground , and sunk all their Ordinance in the sea , taking with him certain Caravels and ships that lay in the road , with provision of all things that he wanted : and therewith departed again to sea . Whereupon the king caused the principali actors therein to be punished , and sent a company of soldiers thither again , which went out of Tercera , with all kind of warlike munition , and great shot , making the foretresse up again , the better to defend the Island , trusting no more in the Portugales . 
 The 99 Chapter . 
 THe ninth of October 1589. there arrived in Tercera fourteene ships that came from the Spanish Indies , laden with Cochenile , Hides , Gold , Silver , Pearls , and other rich wares . They were fiftie in company , when they departed out of the Haven of Havana , whereof , in their coming out of the Channel , eleven sunk in the same Channel by foul weather , the rest by a storm were scattered and separated one from the other . The next day there came another ship of the same company , 
 that sailed close under the Island , so to get into the Road : where she met with and English ship that had not above three cast pieces , and the Spaniards 12. They fought a long time together , which we being in the Island might stand and behold : whereupon the Governor of Tercera sent two boats of Musketeers to help the ship : but before they could come at her , the English ship had shot her under water , and we saw her sink into the Sea with all her sails up , and not any thing seen of her above the water . The Englishmen with their boat saved the Captain and about thirtie others with him , but not one pennyworth of the goods , and yet in the ship there was at the least to the valve of two hundred thousand Ducats in Gold , Silver , and Pearls , the rest of the men were drowned which might-be about fiftie persons , among the which were some Friars and women , which the Englishmen would not save . Those that they had saved they set on land : and then they sailed away . The seven and twentieth of the same month , the said fourteene ships having refreshed themselves in the Island departed from Tercera towards Sivill , and coming upon the coast of Spaine they were taken by the English ships that lay there to watch for them , two only excepted which escaped away , and the rest were wholly carried into England . 
 About the same time the Earl of Cumberland with one of the Queens ships , and five or sixe more , kept about those Islands and came oftentimes so close under the Island , and to the Road of Angra , that the people on land might easily tell all his men that he had aboard , and knew such as walked on the Hatches : they of the Island not once shooting at them , although they might easily have done it , for they were within Musket shot both of the town and fort . In these places he continued for the space of two months , and sailed round about the Islands , and landed in Graciosa and Fayal , as in the description of those Islands I have already declared . Here he took diverse ships and Caravels , which he sent into 67 
 England : so that those of the Island durst not once put forth their heads . At the same time about three or fbure days after the Earl of Cumberland had been in the Island of Fayal , and was departed from thence , there arrived in the said Island of Fayal sixe Indian ships , whose general was one Juan Derives : and there they discharged in the Hand 4 millions of gold and silver . And having with all speed refreshed their ships , fearing the coming of the Englishmen they set sail , and arrived safely in S. Lucar , not meeting with the enemy , to the great good luck of the Spaniards and hard fortune of the Englishmen : for that within less then two days after the gold and silver was laden again into the Spanish ships , the Earl of Cumberland sailed again by that Island : so that it appeared that God would not let them have it , for if they had once had sighed thereof , without doubt it had be theirs , as the Spaniards themselves confessed . 
 In the month of November there arrived in Tercera two great ships , which were the Admiral and Viceadmiral of the Fleet laden with silver , who with stormy weather were separated from the Fleet , and had been in great torment and distress , and ready to sink : for they were forced to use all their Pumps : so that they wished a thousand times to have met with the Englishmen to whom they would willingly have given their silver and all that ever they brought with them , only to save their lives . And although the Earl of Cumberland lay still [ II ii . 181. ] about those Islands , yet they met not with him , so that after much pain and labour they god into the Road before Angra , where with all speed they unladed and discharged above five millions of silver , all in pieces of 8 or 10 pound great : so that the whole Kay lay covered with plataeae and chests of silver , full of Ryales of eight , most wonderful to behold , ( each million being ten hundred thousand ducats , ) beside pearls , gold , and other stones , which were not registered . The Admiral and chief commander of those ships and Fleet called Alvaro 68 
 Flores de Quiniones was sick of the Neapolitan disease , and was brought to land , whereof not long after he died in Sivillia . He brought with him the Kings broad seal and full authority to be general and chief commander upon the Seas , and of all Fleets or ships , and of all places and Islands , or lands wheresoever he came : whereupon the governor of Tercera did him great honour , and between them it was concluded , perceiving the weakness of their ships , and the danger of the Englishmen , that they would send the ships empty with soldiers to convey them , either to Sivill or Lisbon , where they could first arrive , with advice unto his Majesty of all that had passed , and that he would give order to fetch the silver with good and safe convoy . Whereupon the said Alvaro Flores stayed there , under colour of keeping the silver , but specially because of his disease , and for that they were afraid of the Englishmen . This Alvaro Flores had alone for his own part above 50000 Ducats in pearls which he showed unto us , & sought to fell them or barter them with us for spices or Lils of exchange . The said two ships set sail with 3 or 4 hundred men , as well soldiers as others that came with them out of India , and being at sea had a storm , wherewith the Admiral burst and sunk in the sea , & not one man saved . The Vice-Admirall cut down her mast , and ran the ship on ground hard by Setuval , where it burst in pieces , some of the men saving themselves by swimming , that brought the news , but the rest were drowned . 
 In the same month there came two great ships out of the Spanish Indies , and being within half a mile of the Road of Tercera , they met with and English ship , which , after they had fought long together , took them both . About 7 Or 8 months before , there had been and English ship in Tercera , that under the name of a Frenchman came to traffic in the Island , there to lade woad , and being discovered was both ship and goods confiscated to the kings use , and all the men kept 
 prisoners : yet went they up and down the streets to get their livings , by labouring like slaves , being in deed as safe in that Island , as if they had been in prison . But in the end upon a Sunday , all the Sailors went down behind the hills called Bresil : where they found a Fisherboat , whereinto they god and rowed into the sea to the Earl of Cumberlands ships , which to their great fortune chanced at that time to come by the Island , and anchored with his ships about half a mile from the Road of Angra , hard by two small Islands , which lie about a bases shot from the Island and are full of Goats , Dear and Sheep , belonging to the inhabitants of the Island of Tercera . Those Sailors knew it well , and thereupon they rowed unto them with their boats , and lying at anchor that day , they fetched as many Goats and sheep as they had need of : which those of the town and of the Island well saw and beheld , yet durst not once go forth : so there remained no more on land but the Master and the Merchant of the said English ship . This Master had a brother in law dwelling in England , who having news of his brother's imprisonment in Tercera , god licence of the Queen of England to set forth a ship , therewith to see if he could recover his losses of the Spaniards by taking some of them , and so to redeem his brother that lay prisoner in Tercera , and he it was that took the two Spanish ships before the Town , the Master of the ship aforesaid standing on the shore by me , and looking upon them , for he was my great acquaintance . The ships being taken that were worth 300 thousand ducats , he sent all the men on land saving only two of the principali Gentlemen , which he kept aboard thereby to ransom his brother : and sent the Pilot of one of the Indian ships that were taken , with a letter to the Governor of Tercera : wherein he wrote that he should deliver him his brother , & he would send the 2 Gentlemen on land : if not , he would sail with them into England , as indeed he did , because the Governor would not do it , saying 
 LINSCHOTEN’S LARGE TESTIMONY a.d. 1589-91 . that the Gentlemen might make that suit to the king of Spaine himself . This Spanish Pilot we bid to supper with us , and the Englishmen likewise , where he showed us all the manner of their fight , much commending the order and manner of the Englishmens fighting , as also their courteous using of him : but in the end the English Pilot likewise stole away in a French ship , without paying any ransom as yet . 
 In the month of Januarie 1590 there arrived one ship alone in Tercera , that came from the Spanish Indies , and brought news that there was a Fleet of a hundred ships which put out from the Firm land of the Spanish Indies , and by a storm were driven upon the coast called Florida , where they were all cast away , she having only escaped , wherein there were great riches , & many men lost , as it may well be thought : so that they made their account , that of 220 ships that for certain were known to have put out of Nova Spagna , S. Domingo , Havana , Capo verde , Brasilia , Guinea , etc. [ II ii . 182. ] in the year 1589. to sail for Spaine & Portugall , there were not above 14 or 15 of them arrived there in safety , all the rest being either drowned , burst or taken . 
 In the same month of January there arrived in Tercera 15 or 16 ships that came from Sivil , which were most Flyboats of the Low countries , and some Britons that were arrested in Spaine : these came full of soldiers , and well appointed with munition , to lade the silver that lay in Tercera , and to fetch Alvares de Flores by the kings commandment into Spaine . And because that time of the year there are always storms about those Hands , therefore they durst not enter into the road of Tercera , for that as then it blew so great a storm that some of their ships that had anchored were forced to cut down their masts , and were in danger to be lost : and among the rest a ship of Biscaie ran against the land and was stricken in pieces , but all the men saved themselves . The other ships were forced to keep the sea 
 and separate themselves one from the other , where wind and weather would drive them until the 15 of March for that in all that time they could not have one day of fair weather to anchor in , whereby they endured much misery , cursing both the silver and the Hand . This storm being passed , they chanced to meet with a small English ship of about 40 tons in bigness , which by reason of the great wind could not bear all her sails : so they set upon her and took her , and with the English flag in their Admirals stern , they came as proudly into the haven as if they had conquered all the realm of England : but as the Admiral that bore the English flag upon her stern was entering into the road , there came by chance two English ships by the Hand that paid her so well for her pains , that they were forced to cry Misericordia , and without all doubt had taken her , if she had be but a mile further in the sea : but because she god under the Fortress , which also began to shoot at the Englishmen , they were forced to leave her , and to put further into the sea , having slain five or sixe of the Spaniards . The Englishmen that were taken in the small ship were put under hatches , and coupled in bolts , and after they had be prisoners 3 or 4 days , there was a Spanish Ensign-bearer in the ship that had a brother slain in the Fleet that came for England , who as then minding to revenge his death , and withal to show his manhood on the English captives that were in the English ship , which they had taken , as is aforesaid , took a poniard in his hand and went down under the hatches , where finding the poor Englishmen sitting in bolts , with the same poniard he stabbed sixe of them to the heart : which two others of them perceiving , clasped each other about the middle , because they would not be murdered by him , & threw themselves into the sea and there were drowned . This act was of all the Spaniards much disliked and very ill taken , so that they carried the Spaniard prisoner unto Lisbon , where being arrived , the 
 king of Spaine willed he should be sent into England , that the Queen of England might use him as she thought good : which sentence his friends by intreaty god to be reversed , notwithstanding he commanded he should without all favour be beheaded : but upon a good Friday the Cardinali going to mass , all the captains and Commanders made so great entreaty for him , that in the end they god his pardon . This I thought good to note , that men might understand the bloody & dishonest minds of the Spaniards when they have men under their subjection . 
 The same two English ships which followed the Spanish Admiral till he had god the Fort of Tercera , as I said before , put into the sea , where they met with another Spanish ship being of the same Fleet , that had likewise be scattered by the storm and was only missing , for the rest lay in the road . This small ship the Englishmen took , and sent all the men on shore , not hurting any of them : but if they had known what had be done unto the foresaid English captives , I believe they would soon have revenged themselves , as afterwards many and innocent soul paid for it . This ship thus taken by the Englishmen , was the same that was taken and confiscated in the Hand of Tercera by the Englishmen that god out of the Hand in a fisher boat ( as TO said before ) and was sold unto the Spaniards that as then came from the Indies , wherewith they sailed to S. Lucar , where it was also arrested by the duke , and appointed to go in company to fetch the silver in Tercera , because it was a ship that sailed well , but among the Spaniards Fleet it was the meanest of the company . By this means it was taken from the Spaniards and carried into England , and the owners had it again when they least thought of it . 
 The 19 of March the aforesaid ships being 19 in number , set sail , having laden the kings silver , and received in Alvaro Flores de Quiniones , with his company and good provision of necessaries , munition and 73 
 A.D. 
 I589-9I . 
 soldiers that were fully resolved ( as they made show ) to fight valiantly to the last man before they would yield or loose their riches : and although they set their course for S. Lucar , the wind drave them unto Lisbon , which ( as it seemed ) was willing by his force to help them , and to bring them thither in safety , although Alvaro de Flores , both against the wind and weather would perforce have sailed to Saint Lucar , but being constrained by the wind and importunity of the sailors that protested they would require their losses and damages of him , he was content to sail to Lisbon : from whence the silver was by land carried unto Sivil . At Cape S. Vincent there lay a Fleet of 20 English ships to watch for the Armada , so that if they had put into S. Lucar , they had fallen right into their hands , which if the wind had served they had done . And therefore they may say that the wind hath lent them a happy voyage : for if the Englishmen had met with them , they had surely be in great danger , and possibly but few of them had escaped , by reason of the fear wherewith they were possessed , because fortune or rather God was wholly against them : which is a sufficient cause to make the Spaniards out of heart , & to the contrary to give the Englishmen more courage , and to make them bolder for that they are victorious , stout and valiant : and seeing all their enterprises do take so good effect , that thereby they are become lords and master's of the sea , and need care for no man , as it well appears by this brief discourse . 
 The 7 of August 1590. a navy of English ships was seen before Tercera , being 20 in number , and 5 of them the Queens ships : their general was one Martin Frobisher , as we after had intelligence . They came purposely to watch for the Fleet of the Spanish Indies , and for the Indian ships , and the ships of the countries' in the West : which put the Handers in great fear , specially those of Fayal , for that the Englishmen sent a trumpet to the Governor to ask certain wine , flesh , and other victuals for their money and good friendship . 
 They of Fayal did not only refuse to give ear unto them , but with a shot killed their messenger or trumpeter : which the Englishmen took in evil part , sending them word that they were best to look to themselves and stand upon their guard , for they meant to come and visit them whither they would or no . The Governor made them answer , that he was there in the behalf of his majesty of Spaine , and that he would do his best to keep them out , as he was bound : but nothing was done , although they of Fayal were in no little fear , sending to Tercera for aid , from whence they had certain barks with powder and munition for war , with some biscuit and other necessary provision . 
 The 30 of August we received very certain news out of Portugal , that there were 80 ships put out of the Groin laden with victuals , munition , money and soldiers , to go for Britaine to aid the Catholics and Leaguers of France against the king of Navarre . At the same time two Netherland hulks coming out of Portugal ! to Tercera being half the Seas over , met with 4 of the Queens ships , their general being sir John Hawkins , that stayed them , but let them go again without doing them any harm . The Netherlanders reported , that each of the Queens ships had 80 pieces of Ordinance , and that captain Drake lay with 40 ships in the English channel watching for the army of the Groin : and likewise that there lay at the Cape S. Vincent ten other English ships , that if any ships escaped from the Hands , they might take them . These tidings put the Handers in great fear , lest if they failed of the Spanish fleet and god nothing by them , that then they would fallen upon the Hands , because they would not return empty home , whereupon they held strait watch , sending advice unto the king what news they herd . 
 The first of September there came to the Hand of S. Michael a Portugall ship out of the haven of Phernambuck in Brasile , which brought news that the Admiral of the Portugall Fleet that came from India , having 75 
 missed the Hand of S. Helena , was of necessity constrained to put into Phernambuck , although the king had expressly under a great penalty forbidden him so to do , because of the worms that there do spoil the ships . The same ship wherein Bernardin Ribero was Admiral the year before 1589. sailed out of Lisbon into the Indies , with 5 ships in her company , whereof but 4 god into India , the 5 was never herd of , so that it was thought to be cast away : the other foure returned safe again into Portugall , though the Admiral was much spoiled , because he met with two English ships that fought long with him , and slew many of his men , but yet he escaped from them . 
 The 5 of the same month there arrived in Tercera a caravel of the Hand of Corvo , & brought with her 50 men that had been spoiled by the Englishmen who had set them on shore in the Hand of Corvo , being taken out of a ship that came from the Spanish Indies , they brought tidings that the Englishmen had taken 4 more of the Indian ships , & a caravel with the king of Spaines letters of advice for the ships coming out of the Portugal Indies , & that with those which they had taken , they were at the least 40 English ships together , so y* not one - bark escaped them , but fell into their hands , & that therefore the Portugall ships coming out of India durst not put into the Hands , but took their course under 40 & 42 degrees , and from thence sailed to Lisbon , shunning likewise the cape S. Vincent , otherwise they could not have had a prosperous journey of it , for that as then the sea was full of English ships . Whereupon the king advised the fleet lying in Havana in the Spanish Indies ready to come for Spaine , that they should stay there all that year till the next year , because of the great danger they might fall into by the Englishmen , which was no small charge , & hindrance to the fleet , for that the ships that lie there do consume themselves , and in a manner eat up one another , by reason of the great number of people , together with the scarcity of all things , 76 
 so that many ships chosen rather one by one to adventure [ II ii . 184. . ] themselves alone to get home , then to stay there : all which fell into the Englishmens hands , whereof diverse of Great havoc the men were brought into Tercera , for that a whole °f^Pantariis-day we could see nothing else , but spoiled men set on shore , some out of one ship , some out of another , that pity it was to see all of them cursing the Englishmen & their own fortune's , with those that had be the causes to provoke the Englishmen to fight , and complaining of the small remedy and order taken therein by the king of Spaines officers . 
 The 19 of the same month there came to Tercera a Caravel of Lisbon , with one of the kings officers , to cause the goods that were saved out of the ship which came from Malacca ( for you which we stayed there ) to be laden and sent to Lisbon . And at the same time there put out of the Groin one DONE Alonso de Ba^an , with 40 great ships of war to come unto the Hands , there to watch for the fleet of the Spanish & Portugall Indies , and the goods of the Malacca ship being laden , they were to convoy them all together into the river of Lisbon : but being certain days at sea , always having a contrary wind , they could not get unto the Hands , only two of them that were scattered from the fleet , arrived at Tercera , and not finding the fleet , they presently returned to seek them : in the mean time the king changed his mind , & caused the fleet to stay in India , as I said before : and therefore he sent word unto DONE Alonso de Bassan , that he should return again to the Groin , which he presently did ( without doing any thing , nor once approaching near the Hands , saving only the two foresaid ships , for he well knew that the Englishmen lay by the Hand of Corvo , but he would not visit them : and so he returned to the haven the Groin , whereby our goods that came from Malacca were yet to ship , and trussed up again , and forced to stay a more fortunate time with patience perforce . 
 The 23 of October there arrived in Tercera a Caravel 
 with advice out of Portugall , that of 5 ships which in the year 1590 were laden in Lisbon for the Indies , 4 of them were turned again to Portin . After they had be 4 months abroad , & that the Admiral , wherein the Viceroy called Mathias d’Albukerk sailed , had only got to India , as afterwards news thereof was brought overland , having been at the least 11 months at sea & never saw land , and came in great misery to Malacca . In this ship there died by the way 280 men , according to a note by himself made , and sent to the Cardinal at Lisbon , with the names & surnames of every man , together with a description of his voyage , & the misery they had endured , which was only done , because he would not loose the government of India : and for that cause he had sworn either to loose his life , or to arrive in India , as in deed he did afterwards , but to the great danger , loss and hindrance of his company , that were forced to buy it with their lives , & only for want of provision , as it may well be thought : for he knew full well that if he had returned back again into Portugal as the other ships did , he should have been cassiered from his Indian regiment , because the people began already to murmur at him for his proud & lofty mind . And among other things that showed his pride the more , behind above the gallery of his ship he caused Fortune to be painted , & his own picture w‘ a staff standing by her , as it were threatening Fortune , with this posy , Quero que vencas , that is , I will have thee to overcome : which being read by the Cardinal & other gentlemen ( that to honour him brought him aboard his ship ) it was thought to be a point of exceeding folly : but it is no strange matter among the Portugals : for they above all others must of force let the fool peep out of their sleeves , specially when they are in authority , for that I knew the said Mathias d’Albukerk in India , being a soldier and a captain , where he was esteemed and accounted for one of the best of them , & much honoured , and beloved of all men , as behaving himself courteously to every man , 
 LINSCHOTEN’S LARGE TESTIMONY a.d. 1589-91 . 
 whereby they all desired that he might be Viceroy . But when he once had received his patent with full power & authority from the king to be Viceroy , he changed so much from his former behaviour , that by reason of his pride , they all began to fear and curse him , and that before he departed out of Lisbon , as it is often seen in many men that are advanced unto state and dignity . 
 The 20 of Januarie 1591. there was news brought out of Portugall into Tercera , that the Englishmen had taken a ship that the king had sent into the Portugal-Indies , wl advice to the Viceroy for the returning again of the 4 ships that should have gone to India , & because the ships were come back again , that ship was stuffed and jaded as full of goods as possible it might be , having likewise in ready money 500 thousand ducats in royals of 8 , beside other wares . It departed from Lisbon in the month of November 1590. & met with the Englishmen , with whom for a time it fought , but in the end it was taken and carried into England with men & all , yet when they came there , the men were set at liberty , and returned into Lisbon , where the captain was committed prisoner ; but he excused himself and was released , with whom I spoke my self , & he made this report unto me . At the same time also they took a ship that came from the Mine laden with gold , & 2 ships laden with pepper & spices that were to sail into Italy , the pepper only that was in them , being worth 170 thousand ducats : all these ships were carried into England , & made good prize . 
 In the month of July 1591. there happened and earth - [ II ii . 185. ] quake in the Hand of S. Michael , which continued from the 26 of July , to the 12 of August , in which time no man durst stay within his house but fled into the fields , fasting & praying with great sorrow , for that many of their houses fell down , and a town called Villa Franca , was almost clean razed to the ground , all the cloisters & houses shaken to the earth , and therein some people slain . The land in some places rose up , and the cliffs 
 removed from one place to another , and some hills were defaced and made even with the ground . The earthquake was so strong , that the ships which lay in the road and on the sea , shaked as if the world would have turned round : there sprang also a fountain out of the earth , from whence for the space of 4 days , there flowed a most clear water , & after that it ceased . At the same time they herd such thunder & noise under the earth , as if all the devils in hell had been assembled together in that place , wherewith many died for fear . The Hand of Tercera shook 4 times together , so that it seemed to turn about , but there happened no misfortune unto it . Earthquakes are common in those Hands , for about 20 years passed there happened another earthquake , wherein a high hill that lies by the same town of Villa Franca , fell half down , & covered all the town with earth , and killed many men . The 25 of August the kings Armada commi ng out of Ferol arrived in Tercera being in all 30 ships , Biskaines , Portugals and Spaniards , and 10 dutch flyboats that were arrested in Lisbon to serve the king , beside other small ships & pataxos , that came to serve as messengers from place to place , and to discover the seas . This navy came to stay for , and convoy the ships that should come from the Spanish Indies , and the flyboats were appointed in their return home , to take in the goods that were saved in the lost ship that came from Malacca , and to convoy them to Lisbon . 
 The 13 of September the said Armada arrived at the Hand of Corvo , where the Englishmen with about 16 ships as then lay , staying for the Spanish fleet , whereof some or the most part were come , and there the English were in good hope to have taken them . But when they perceived the kings army to be strong , the Admiral being the lord Thomas Howard , commanded his Fleet not to fall upon them , nor any of them once to separate their ships from him , unless he gave commission so to do : notwithstanding the viceadmiral sir Richard Greenvil being in the ship called the Revenge , went into the 80 
 Spanish fleet , and shot among them doing them great hurt , & thinking the rest of the company would have followed , which they did not , but left him there , & sailed away : the cause why could not be known . Which the Spaniards perceiving , with 7 or 8 ships they boarded her , but she withstood them all , fighting with them at the least 12 hours together and sunk two of them , one being a new double Flyboat of 600 tons , and Admiral of the Flyboats , the other a Biscain : but in the end by reason of the number that came upon her , she was taken , but to their great loss : for they had lost in fighting and by drowning above 400 men , and of the English were slain about 100 , Sir Richard Greenvil himself being wounded in his brain , whereof afterwards he died . He was carried into the ship called S. Paul , wherein was the Admiral of the fleet DONE Alonso de Ba^an : there his wounds were dressed by the Spanish surgeons , but DONE Alonso himself would neither see him nor speak with him : all the rest of the captains and gentlemen went to visit him , and to comfort him in his hard fortune , wondering at his courage and stout heart , for y‘ he showed not any sign of faintness nor changing of colour ; but feeling the hour of death to approach , he spoke these words in Spanish , and said : Here die I Richard Greenvil with a joyful & quiet mind , for that I have ended my life as a true soldier ought to do , that hath fought for his country , Queen , religion and honour , whereby my soul most joyful departeth out of this body , & shall always leave behind it and everlasting fame of a valiant & true soldier that hath done his duty as he was bound to do . When he had finished these or such other like words , he gave up the Ghost , with great & stout courage , & no man could perceive any true sign of heaviness in him . 
 This sir Rich. Greenvil was a great and a rich gentleman in England , & had great yearly revenues of his own inheritance , but he was a man very unquiet in his mind , and greatly affected to war ; insomuch as of un 81 F 
 his own private motion he offered his service to the Queen : he had performed many valiant acts , and was greatly feared in these Hands , and known of every man , but of nature very severe , so that his own people hated him for his fierceness , & spoke very hardly of him : for when they first entered into the fleet or Armada , they had their great sail in a readiness , and might possibly enough have sailed away , for it was one of the best ships for sail in England , and the master perceiving that the other ships had left them , & followed not after , commanded the great sail to be cut that they might make away : but sir Rich. Greenvil threatened both him & all the rest that were in the ship , y‘ if any man laid hand upon it , he would cause him to be hanged , and so by that occasion they were compelled to fight & in the end were taken . He was of so hard a complexion , that as he continued among the Spanish captains while they were at dinner or supper with him , he would carouse 3 or 4 glasses of wine , and in a bravery take the glasses be - [ II ii . 186. ] tween his teeth and crash them in pieces & swallow them down , so that oftentimes the blood ran out of his mouth without any harm at all unto him : & this was told me by diverse credible persons that many times stood and beheld him . The Englishmen that were left in the ship , as the captain of the soldiers , the master and others were dispersed into diverse of the Spanish ships that had taken them , where there had almost a new fight arisen between the Biscains and the Portugals : while each of them would have the honour to have first boarded her , so that there grew a great noise and quarrel among them , one taking the chief ensign , and the other the flag , and the captain and every one held his own . The ships that had boarded her were altogether out of order , and broken , and many of their men hurt , whereby they were compelled to come into the Island of Tercera , there to repair themselves : where being arrived , I and my chamber-fellow , to hear some news , went aboard one of the ships being a great Biscain , and one of 
 the 12 Apostles , whose captain was called Bartandono , that had been General of the Biscains in the fleet that went for England . He seeing us called us up into the gallery , where with great courtesy he received us , being as then set at dinner with the English captain that sat by him , and had on a suit of black velvet , but he could not tell us any thing , for that he could speak no other language but English and Latin , which Bartandono also could a little speak . The English captain god licence of the governor that he might come on land with his weapon by his side , and was in our lodging with the Englishman that was kept prisoner in the Hand , being of that ship whereof the sailors god away , as I said before . The governor of Tercera bade him to dinner , and showed him great courtesy . The master likewise with licence of Bartandono came on land and was in our lodging , and had at the least io or 12 wounds , as well in his head as on his body , whereof after that being at sea between Lisbon & the Hands he died . The captain wrote a letter , wherein he declared all the manner of the fight , and left it with the English merchant that lay in our lodging , to send it to the lord Admiral of England . This English captain coming unto Lisbon , was there well received and not any hurt done unto him , but with good convoy sent to Setuval , and from thence sailed into England with all the rest of the Englishmen that were taken prisoners . 
 The Spanish army stayed at the Hand of Corvo till the last of September , to assemble the rest of the fleet together , which in the end were to the number of 140 sails of ships partly coming from India , and partly of the army , and being altogether ready to sail to Tercera in good company , there suddenly rose so hard & cruel a storm , that those of the Hands did afiirme , that in men memory there was never any such seen or herd off " before : for it seemed the sea would have swallowed up the Hands , the water mounting higher then the cliffs , which are so high that it amasseth a man to behold them : 
 but the sea reached above them , and living fish were thrown upon the land . This storm continued not only a day or two with one wind , but 7 or 8 days continually , the wind turning round about in all places of the compass , at the lest twice or thrice during that time , and all alike , with a continual storm and tempest most terrible to behold , even to us that were on shore , much more then to such as were at sea : so that only on the coasts and cliffs of the Hand of Tercera , there were above 12 ships cast away , and not only upon the one side , but round about it in every corner , whereby nothing else was herd but complaining , crying , lamenting & telling , here is a ship broken in pieces against the cliffs , and there another , and all the men drowned : so that for the space of 20 days after the storm , they did nothing else but fish for dead men that continually came driving on the Thewracketf shore . Among the rest was the English ship called thee the Revenge . Revenge , that was cast away upon a cliff near to the 
 Hand of Tercera , where it brake in and hundred pieces & sunk to the ground , having in her 70 men Galegos , Biscains , and others , with some of the captive Englishmen , whereof but one was saved that god up upon the cliffs alive , and had his body and head all wounded , and he being on shore brought us the news desiring to be shriven , & thereupon presently died . The Revenge had in her diverse fair brass pieces that were all sunk in you sea , which they of the Hand were in good hope to weigh up again the next Summer after . Among these ships that were cast away about Tercera , was likewise a Flyboat , one of those that had been arrested in Portugall to serve the king , called the white Dove , the master of her was one Cornelius Martenson of Schiedam in Holland , and there were in her 100 soldiers , as in every one of the rest there were . He being overruled by the captain that he could not be master of his own , sailing here and there at the mercy of God , as the storm drove him , in the end came within the sighed of the Hand of Tercera , which the Spaniards perceiving thought all their safety 84 
 LINSCHOTEN’S LARGE TESTIMONY a. worser 1589-91 . only to consist in putting into the road , compelling the Master and the Pilot to make towards the Hand , although the master refused to do it , saying , that they were most sure there to be cast away and utterly spoiled : but the captain called him drunkard and Heretic , and striking him with a staff , commanded him to do as he would have him . The Master seeing this and being compelled to do it , said : well then my Master's , seeing it is the desire of you all to be cast away , I can but loose one life , [ II ii . 187. ] and therewith desperately he sailed towards the shore , and was on that side of the Hand , where there was nothing else but hard stones and rocks , as high as mountains , most terrible to behold , where some of the inhabitants stood with long ropes and cork bound at the end thereof , to throw them down unto the men , that they might lay hold upon them , and save their lives : but few of them god so near , most of them being cast away , and smitten in pieces before they could get to the wall . The ship sailing in this manner ( as I said before ) towards the Hand , and approaching to the shore , the master being and old man , and full of years , called his son that was in the ship with him , and having embraced one another , and taken their last farewell , the good old father willed his son not to take care for him , but seek to save himself ; for ( said he ) son thou art young , & mayest have some hope to save thy life , but as for me it is no great matter ( I am old ) what become of me , and therewith each of these shedding many tears , as every loving father and kind child may well consider , the ship fell upon the cliffs , and brake in pieces , the father on the one side , the son on the other side falling into the sea , each laying hold upon that which came next to hand , but to no purpose ; for the sea was so high and furious , that they were all drowned , and only foureteene or fifteene saved themselves by swimming , with their legs and arms half broken and out of joint , among which was the Master's son , and foure other Dutch boys : the rest of the Spaniards and Sailors , with the Captain and Master , were 
 drowned . Whose heart would not melt with tears to behold so grievous a sighed , specially considering with himself that the greatest cause thereof was the beastliness and insolency of the Spaniards , as in this only example may well be seen ? Whereby may be considered how the other ships sped , as we our selves did in part behold , and by the men that were saved did hear more at large , as also some others of our countrymen that as then were in the like danger can well witness . 
 On the other Hands the loss was no less then in Tercera : for on the Hand of Saint George there were two ships cast away : on the Hand of Pico two ships : on the Hand of Gratiosa three ships : and beside those there came every where round about diverse pieces of broken ships , and other things fleeting towards the Hands , wherewith the sea was all covered most pitiful to behold . On the Hand of S. Michael there were foure ships cast away , and between Tercera and S. Michael three more were sunk , which were seen and herd to cry out ; whereof not one man was saved . The rest put into the sea without masts , all torn and rend : so that of thee Above 100 whole fleet and armada , being 140 ships in all , there were but 32 or 33 arrived in Spaine and Portugall , yea , and shlp^dnuned . those few with so great misery , pain and labour , that not two of them arrived there together , but this day one , and to morrow another , next day the third , and so one after the other to the number aforfesayd . All the rest were cast away upon the Hands , and overwhelmed in the Sea , whereby may be considered what great loss and hindrance they received at that time : for by many men's judgements it was esteemed to be much more then was lost by their army that came for England ; and it may well be thought , and presumed , that it was no other but a just plague purposely sent by God upon the Spaniards , and that it might truly be said , the taking of the Revenge was justly revenged upon them , and not by the might or force of man , but by the power of God , as some of them openly said in the lie of Tercera , that they 86 
 believed verily God would consume them , and that he took part with the Lutherans and heretics : saying further that so soon as they had thrown the dead body of the Viceadmiral Sir Richard Greenfield overboard , they verily thought that as he had a devilish faith and religion , and therefore the devils loved him , so he presently sunk into the bottom of the sea , and down into hell , where he raised up all the devils to the revenge of his death : and that they brought so great storms and torments upon the Spaniards , because they only maintained the Catholic & Romish religion . Such and the like blasphemies against God , they ceased not openly to utter , without being reproved of any man therein , nor for their false opinions : but the most part of them rather said and affirmed , that of truth it must needs be so . 
 As one of those Indian fleets put out of Nova Spagna , there were 35 of them by storm and tempest cast away and drowned in the Sea , being 50 in all ; so that but 15 escaped . Of the fleet that came from Santo Domingo there were 14 cast away , coming out of the channel of Havana , whereof the Admiral and Viceadmiral were two of them : and from Terra Firma in India there came two ships laden with gold and silver , that were taken by the Englishmen : and before the Spanish army came to Corvo , the Englishmen at times had taken at the least 20 ships , that came from S. Domingo , India , Brasilia , etc. and were all sent into England .
