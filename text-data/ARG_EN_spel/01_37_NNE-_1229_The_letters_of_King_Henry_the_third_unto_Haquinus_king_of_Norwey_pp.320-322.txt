 HEnry by the grace of God , etc. unto Haquinus by the same grace King of Norway , sends greeting . 
 we render unto your highness unspeakable thanks for those things which by your letters , and by your discreet subject the Abbot of Lisa , you have signified unto us , and also for that you are right willing and desirous to begin and to conclude between us both , a league of peace and amity . And we for our part both now are , and hereafter shall well contented , that both our lands be common , to the end that the Merchants and people of your dominions may freely and without impediment resort unto our land , and our people and Merchants may likewise have recourse unto your territories . Provided , that for the confirmation of this matter , you send unto us your letters patents , and we will send ours also unto you . Howbeit in the mean while we do will and freely grant , that the Merchants both of our and your lands , may go , come , and return to and from both our Dominions . And if there be ought in your mind , whereby we might stand you in any stead , you may boldly signify the same unto us . we have as yet detained the foresaid Abbot , that we might , to our ability , cause restitution to be made for your ship , and for the things therein contained : by whom we will certify you of our own estate , and of the estate of our
