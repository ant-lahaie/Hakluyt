 480 
 Further , as he hath herd ( not having be in those parts himself ) ships may sail from the dominions of Cathaia unto India . But of other ways , or how the seas lie by any coast he knoweth not . 
 The instruction of another Tartarian merchant dwelling in the city of Boghar , as he hath learned by other his countrymen which have be there . 
 First from Astracan by sea to Serachick is 15 days : affirming also that a man may travel the other way before written by Turkemen . 
 From Serachick to Urgence is 15 days . 
 From Urgence to Boghar also 15 days . 
 Note . These last 30 days journey is without habitation of houses : therefore travellers lodge in their own tents , carrying with them to eat , their several provisions : and for dryness there be many wells of fair water at equal baiting places not far distant daily to be had . 
 From Boghar to Taskent easy traveling with goods , is 14 days by land .

 complexion . Their religion also , as the Tartars report , is Christian , or after the manner of Christians , and their language peculiar , differing from the Tartarian tongue . 
 There are no great and furious Bears in traveling through the wales aforesaid , but wolves white and black . And because that woods are not of such quantity there , as in these parts of Russia , but in manner rather scant then plentiful , as is reported , the Bears breed not that way , but some other beasts ( as namely one in Russe called Barse ) are in those coasts . This Barse appears by a skin of one seen here to fell , to be never so great as a big lion spotted very fair and therefore we here take it to be a Leopard or Tiger . 
 Note that 20 days journey from Cathay is a country nam Angrim , where lives the beast that bears the best Musk , & the principali thereof is cut out of the knee of the male . The people are taunie , & for that the men are not bearded nor differ in complexion from women , they have certain tokens of iron , that is to say : the men wear the sun round like a boss upon their shoulders , and women on their privy parts . Their feeding is raw flesh in the same land , and in another called * Titay : the Duke there is called Can . They worship the fire , and it is 34 days journey from great Cathay , and in the way lies the beautiful people , eating with knives of gold , and are called Comorom , and the land of small people is nearer the Mosko then Cathay .
