A Commission given by us Thomas Randolfe Ambassador for the Queens Majestic in Russia , and Thomas Bannister , etc. unto James Bassendine , James Woodcock and Richard brown , the which Bassendine , Woodcock , and brown we appoint jointly together , and aiders , the one of them to the other , in a voyage of discovery to be made ( by the grace of God ) by them , for searching of the sea , and border of the coast , from the river Pechora , to the Eastwards , as hereafter follows Anno 1588. The first of August . 
 Qprimis , when your bark with all furniture is ready , you shall at the beginning of the year ( assoon as you possibly may ) make your repair to the Eastern part of the river Pechora , where is and Island called Dolgoieve , and from thence you shall pass to the Eastwards alongst 
 by the Sea coast of Hugorie , or the main land of 119 
 Pechora , and sailing alongst by the same coast , you shall pass within seven leagues of the Island Vaigats , which is in the straight , almost half way from the coast of Hugorie , unto the coast of Nova Zembla , which Island Vaigats and Nova Zembla you shall find noted in your plate , therefore you shall not need to discover it : but proceed on alongst the coast of Hugory , towards the river Obba . 
 There is a Bay between the said Vaigats , and the river Obba , that does bite to the Southwards , into the land of Hugory , in which Bay are two small rivers , the one called Cara Reca , the other Naramsy , as in the paper of notes which are given to you herewith may appear : in the which Bay you shall not need to spend any time for searching of it , but to direct your course to the river Ob ( if otherwise you be not constrained to keep alongst the shore ) and when you come to the river Ob you shall not enter into it , but pass over unto the Eastern part of the mouth of the said river . 
 And when you are at the Eastern part of the mouth of Obba Reca , you shall from thence pass to the Eastwards , alongst by the border of the said coast , describing the same in such perfect order as you can best do it . You shall not leave the said coast or border of the land , but pass alongst by it , at least in sighed of the same , until you have sailed by it so far to the Eastwards , and the time of the year so far spent , that you do think it time for you to return with your bark to Winter , which travel may well be 300 or 400 leagues to the Eastwards of the Ob , if the Sea do reach so far as our hope is it does : but and if you find not the said coast and sea to trend so far to the Eastwards , yet you shall not leave the coast at any time , but proceed alongst by it , as it does lie , leaving no part of it unsearched , or seen , unless it be some bay , or river , that you do certainly know by the report of the people , that you shall find in those borders , or else some certain 
 120 
 COMMISSION TO BASSENDINE tokens whereby you of your selves may judge it to be so . For our hope is that the said border of land and sea does in short space after you pass the Ob , incline East , and so to the Southwards . And therefore we would have no part of the land of your starreboord side , as you proceed in your discovery , to be left undiscovered . 
 But and if the said border of land do not incline so to the Eastwards as we presuppose it , but that it do prove to incline and trend to the Northwards , and so join with Nova Zembla , making the sea from Vaigats to the Eastwards but a bay : yet we will that you do keep alongst by the said coast , and so bring us certain report of that form and manner of the same bay . 
 And if it do so prove to be a bay , and that you have passed round about the same , and so by the trending of the land come back unto that part of Nova Zembla that is against Vaigats , whereas you may from that see the said Island Vaigats , if the time of the year will permit you , you shall from thence pass alongst by the said border and coast of Nova Zembla to the Westwards , and so to search whither that part of Nova Zembla do join with the land that sir Hugh Willoughby discovered in anno 53 , and is in 72 degrees , and from that part of Nova Zembla 120 leagues to the Westwards , as your plate doth show it unto you : and if you do find that land to join with Nova Zembla , when you come to it , you shall proceed further along the same coast , if the time of the year will permit it , and that you do think there will be sufficient time for you to return back with your bark to Winter either at Pechora or in Russia , at your discretion : for we refer the same to your good judgements , trusting that you will loose no time , that may further your knowledge in this voyage . 
 Note you , it was the 20 of August , 56 year the Serchthrift began to return back from her discovery , to Winter in Russia , and then she came from the Island 121 
 Vaigats , being forcibly driven from thence with and Easterly wind and ice , and so she came into the river Dwina , and arrived at Colmogro the 11 of September , 56. If the ice had not be so much that year as it was in the Straights , on both sides of the Island Vaigats , they in the said pinnace would that year have discovered the parts that you are now sent to seek : which thing ( if it had pleased God ) might have be done then : but God hath reserved it for some other . Which discovery , if it may be made by you , it shall not only prove profitable unto you , but it will also purchase perpetuali fame and renown both to you and our country . And thus not doubting of your willing desires , and forwardness towards the same , we pray God to bless you with a lucky beginning , fortunate success , and happily to end the same . Amen .
