, unto which we came upon Sunday night next following . And upon Munday morning the first of Februarie , we saw two ships in a sandy bay : so we stirred in with them , which were Frenchmen bound for the West Indies , and put all into the bay , where we refreshed our selves with fish , in which there was infinite store , and stayed there until Thursday the 5 . at which time we stood up with the Cape again , where road the Frenchman and his pinnace , who put forth right afore us , and another Frenchman and his caravel well manned : So all we 5 . English came to and anchor by them , where after kind greeting with many shots out of every ship both English and French , all our captains were invited to a feast aboard the French admiral : where after great cheer and kind entertainment , it was concluded on all hands to take the Isle of Fogo , if God would give us leave . The same day we all weighed and stood along for the The Island jsje of ga ^ unto which we came the 8 . of Februarie , of and anchored altogether at a bay in the West part thereof : in which Island we had good store of goats and fresh fish . There is no man dwelling upon the Island that we could see . we could find no fresh water upon it , but one standing puddle of bad water : it hath foure great mountains upon the 4 . corners of it . Here the Frenchmen ( as it seems being overcome with drink , having be aboard our general at a feast ) being on shore , one of the gentlemen of their company was slain , and their chief captain sorely wounded : by reason whereof , and of the setting together of a pinnace which they were about , the French admiral and the caravel stayed behind . So we in the Watte , and the other 6 . ships weighed the 10 . of Februarie ,
