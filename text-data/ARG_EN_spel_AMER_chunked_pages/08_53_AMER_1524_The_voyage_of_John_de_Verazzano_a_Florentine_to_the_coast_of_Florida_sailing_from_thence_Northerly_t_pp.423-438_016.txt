and certain hills , they may have some minerali matter in them , because we saw many of them Beads of have beadstones of Copper hanging at their ears . We copper . 437 departed from thence keeping our course Northeast along the coast , which we found more pleasant champion and without woods , with high mountains within the land continuing directly along the coast for the space of fiftie leagues , we discovered 32 Islands lying all near the land , being small and pleasant to the view , high and having many turnings and windings between them , making many fair harboroughs and channels as they do in the gulf of Venice in Sclavonia , and Dalmatia , we had no knowledge or acquaintance with the people : we suppose they are of the same manners and nature as the others are . Sailing Northeast for the space of 150 . leagues we approached to the land that in times past was discovered by the Britons , which is in fiftie degrees . Having now spent all our provision and victuals , and having discovered about 700 leagues and more of new Countries ' , and being furnished with water and wood , we concluded to return into France . Touching the religion of this people , which we have found , for want of their language we could not understand neither by signs nor gesture that they had any religion or law at all , or that they did acknowledge any first cause or mover , neither that they worship the heaven or stars the Sun or Moon or other planets , and much less whither they be idolaters , neither could we learn whither that they used any kind of sacrifices or other adorations , neither in their villages have they any Temples or houses of prayer . We suppose that they have no religion at all , and that they live at their own liberty . And that all this proceedeth of ignorance , for that they are very easy to be persuaded : and all that they see us Christians do in our divine service , they did the same with the like imitation as they saw us to do it . .
