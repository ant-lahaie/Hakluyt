was boatswain of the Spanish ship , whom we kept with us : and the same day we set sail from thence . The 24 we had advice of our Spanyard of certain The harbour Leaguers which were in the harbour of cape S . Marry . ° Marie § Whereupon the same night , being within five or six ' leagues of the harbour , I sent ofF our two shallops with thirty men to discover the harbour , and to surprise the enemy . The 25 in the morning we approached the harbour with our ship , and in the mouth thereof we espied three shallops , two whereof were ours , and the third of a ship of Rochel , which they had surprised with foure men in her : who told them that there were but two ships in the harbour , whereof one was of Rochel , and the other of Bell isle . And as we were discoursing with the Rochellers , we had sighed of the ships : whereupon we sent our boat aboard the Rocheller to certify him that we were his friends , and to request him not to hinder our fight with the enemy . This message being sent , we made all the haste we could unto the ship of Bell isle , which first began with us with three great shot , one whereof hit our maintopsaile , but both the other missed us . And we also sent one unto them : then being approached never unto them ten or twelve of us went in a shallop to enter them , and we carried also a warp with us to make fast unto their ship , whereby our ship might the better come up to aid us . And when we boarded them in our boat , they betook themselves to their close fights , playing chiefly upon us with shot & pikes out at two ports , between which we entered very dangerously , escaping near dangers both by shot & pike . Some of our men were wounded , but no great harm was done . And mine own piece in entering , was shot out of my hand into 178 the sea
