thou must bring thy self to the offward of Sal medina : and thence stir West till thou bring thy self North and South with Cabeza de Cativa ; and then go Southwest and by West , and thou shalt so fallen with Rio de Francisco . It hath for marks a certain land not very high , and within the land certain high hills lying East and West . And on the West of the river of Francisco thou shalt see certain cliffs that bee sixe leagues from Number de Dios , inclining towards the sea . I advice thee that going this course above written ; if thou see 3 or 4 Isles lying low with the sea , and also lying East and West , thou mayest make account that they be the Islands de Cativa , and then run West , and so thou shalt go along the coast . And if thou see by this way a point of low land , make account it is Punta de Samblas : and upon it thou shalt see a row of high rocky hills , and they be the mountains of Santa Cruz . If thou come from Cartagena to go to Number de Dios in the time of the sea winds , when thou art out from Sal Medina , thou shalt go West and by North , that thou 290 mayest have sea - room , and take the Brisas or Northern winds when they come : and go till thou be North and South with the harbour of Number de Dios : and from thence go Southwest , and if by this way thou see a row of high hills on a coast that lies Northeast and Southwest , make account they are Sierras de las minas Sierras de las Viejas , which minas Viejas lie North and South with the minas vteJas - harbour of Velo alto . Having kept this course abovesaid , Puerto de and having sighed of the former mark , thou mayest a ^ 0 ' account that thou art on the West side of Number de Number de Dios . Dios
