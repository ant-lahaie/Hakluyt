to the mouths of the river are eight leagues in passing along on this side to seek one of the mouths of the river Parana , as it is hereafter described . But you had need first to harbour in a bay , which is in the very cliff or Barranca , and you must stay for the full sea . And if you fallen into the Rio Uruay . mouth of the river which is called Uruay , you must leave it on the right hand , I say on the North side .
