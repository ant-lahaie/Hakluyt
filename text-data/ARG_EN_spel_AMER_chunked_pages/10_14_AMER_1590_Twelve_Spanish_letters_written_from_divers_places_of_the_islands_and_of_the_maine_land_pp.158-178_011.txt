Mexico , the 30 of May 1590 . Bartholomew Canon . 167 [ A letter A letter of Frier Alonso new elected Bishop of Mechuacan , to the king of Spaine , written in Peru in the city de los Reyes the first of March 1590 , touching the state of Arica a chief Haven in Peru . The people of the River of Plate . 100 men wanting . Pon Christmas even the year 1589 , I received your majesties commission in Potossi . For which I am and shall be continually bound to pray for your majesties long health , for the great benefits which your majesty hath bestowed upon me , in sending me to Mechuacan : whereby my great travel and pains may be recompensed , which I have taken with that ungrateful and desperate people of the river of Plate , which they have be the occasion of , in dealing so badly with me their Pastor , which have counseled them , that they should have a great care to serve God , and be dutiful to your majesty , according as every good and true subject ought to do . Now for this gift which your majesty hath bestowed on me , I most humbly kiss your majesties hands a thousand times . Thus presently I departed from Potossi somewhat sickly , to accomplish that which your majesty hath commanded me . So I arrived at Lima in safety the first of February by the way of Arica , which is and haven town , where they embark all the bars of silver . And there I have seen what is done , 8c what they have provided against the Englishmen in that haven : which is ; That there is a little fort made hard by the waters side , with certain small pieces of ordinance in the said fort to offend the enemy , if occasion should serve that they should offer to come into the harbour and offer any violence . But the principali thing of all that we want is to have soldiers , foot men , and horsemen .
