rest of our fleet which were gone before , which we never herd of till our arrival in England at The downs in the month of July , where we understood the rest of our consorts to be passed up for London , Captain Venner & his fleet to be at Plimmouth , and the French ships to be safe arrived at Diepe , which to us was very great comfort . At our setting sail from The downs , according as the custom is , finding the Queens ships there , we saluted them with certain ordinance . The Gunner being careless , as they are many times of their powder , in discharging certain pieces in you gunner room , set a barrel of powder on fire , which took fire in you gunner room , blew up the Admirals caben , slew the gunner with 2 others outright , & hurt 20 more , of which 4 or 5 died . This powder made such a smoke in the ship with the fire that burned in the gunner room among all the fire works , that no man at the first wist what to do : but recalling back their fear , they began to cast water into the gunner room in such abundance ( for the Queens ships now & also the other ships that were in our company came presently to our help ) that ( God be praised ) we put out the fire & saved all , & no great harm was done to the goods . By this may be seen that there is no sure safety of things in this world . For now we made account to be out of all danger , where behold a greater came upon us , then we suffered all the whole voyage . But the almighty be praised for ever , which delivered us out of this and many other in this voyage . Our fire being well put out , and we taking in fresh men ( God be praised ) we came to Black - wall in safety . The king of Spaines resolution to proceed in the discovery y conquest of Rio Grande . .
