Domingo and island called by the 36 finders thereof Hispaniola , is so great quantity of cattle , and such increase thereof , that notwithstanding the daily killing of them for their hides , it is not possible to assuage the number of them , but they are devoured by wild dogs , whose number is such by suffering them Qreat first to range the woods and mountains , that they eat numbers of and destroy 60000 . a year , and yet small lack found wMe worser » & - of them . And no marveile ,
