If it would please your majesty , it were good that the city of Number de Dios might be brought and built in this harbour : it would not be very chargeable unto the citizens by reason that all their houses are made of timber , and they may benefit themselves with the same again , and likewise with the tiles of their houses : the greatest charge will be to land timber and to cut down the mountain of wood . If it please your majesty that the said city of Number de Dios should be built in this harbour the first thing which must be finished is to make up this high way , and so to pull down the Church which is in Number de Dios , and the Contractation house , and so new built it in this harbour : and then to command all the fleets of ships from time to time to come and unladen their goods in this said Puerto Bello : And that those merchants and factors of Spaine which are lygers in Panama and Number de Dios , shall come to this harbour and build anew their warehouses for receiving of their goods . So by these means in short time it will be greatly inhabited with people : also the fleet shall not pass so many dangers as they daily do in Number de Dios : neither will there so many people die as there daily doe in Number de 146 Dios : and the cause thereof is , that those labouring men which do use to unladen those merchandise , are all the whole day wading in the water up to the
