: and so thou shalt go without the force of the water of Rio Grande . And 288 being by day thou shalt go along the coast , and shalt see Morro hermoso , which , as I have said , lies to the West of Rio Grande , and hath for marks , a face of a black land not very high , and it is round . And if thou depart by day from Morro hermoso , thou must go West , and must take heed , as I said before , of the Isle de Arenas , which lies North and South of Samba . Samba hath for a mark as it were a galley towed . And going this way by day , thou shalt see El buio del Gato , which is and high El Buio < kl land with certain white cliffs to the seaward : and also Gat0 â€˜ more to the West thou shalt see the point called Punta Punta de la de la Canoa , which is a low land even with the water : cmoa ' and there endeth the coast which lies East and West . And the Bay that goes to Cartagena begins here , Cartagena . and lies Northeast and Southwest . And take this for a warning , that if thou be benighted against Samba , thou shalt take in thy sails , & lie off to the offward until midnight without any sail abroad until midnight : and from midnight forward thou shalt lie so into the land without sail : and if in the break of day thou see no land , then go Southwest , and if this way thou have sighed of certain white cliffs , make account it is Buio deal Gato . Take this for a warning , if thy ship be great come not nigh the land in the Bay : I mean thou mayest not with a great ship come nigh the land from the point de la Canoa until thou come to Cartagena , because in many places there are not above 3 or 4 fathoms at the most .
