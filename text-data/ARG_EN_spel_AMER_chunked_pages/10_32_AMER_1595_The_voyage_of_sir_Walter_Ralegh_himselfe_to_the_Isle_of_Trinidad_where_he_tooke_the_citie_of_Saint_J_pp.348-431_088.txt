up fresh , two or three leagues from the land . In the passages towards Guiana ( that is , in all those lands which the eight branches of Orenoque fashion into Hands ) there are but one sort of people called Tivitivas , but of two casts as they term them , the one called Ciawani , the other Waraweeti , and those war one with another .

Right South into the land are the Capure - pani , and Emparepani , and beyond those adjoining to Macureguarai ( the first city of Inga ) are the Iwarawakeri : all these are professed enemies to the Spaniards , and to the rich Epuremei also .
