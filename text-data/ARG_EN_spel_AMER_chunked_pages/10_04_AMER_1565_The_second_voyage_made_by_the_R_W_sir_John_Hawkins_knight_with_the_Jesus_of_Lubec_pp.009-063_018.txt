Leona . The 18 of Januarie at night , we departed from Taggarin , being bound for the West Indies , before which departure certain of the Salomons men went on shore to fill water in the night , and as they came on shore with their boat being ready to leap on land , one of them espied and Negro in a white coat , standing upon a rock , being ready to have received them when they came on shore , having in sighed of his fellows also eight or nine , some in one place leaping out , and some in another , but they hid themselves straight again : whereupon our men doubting they had be a great company , and sought to have taken them at more advantage , as God would , departed to their ships , not thinking there had be such a mischief pretended towards them , as then was in deed . Which the next day we understood of a Portugal that came down to us , who had trafficked with the Negroes , by whom he understood , that the king of Sierra Leona had made all the power he could , to take some of us , partly for the desire he had to see what kind of people we were , that had spoiled his people at the Idols , whereof he had news before our coming , and as I judge also , upon other occasions provoked by the Tangomangos , but sure we were that the army was come down , by means that in the evening we saw such a monstrous fire , made by the watering place , that before was not seen , which fire is the only mark for the Tangomangos to know where their army is always . If these men had come down in the evening , they had done us great displeasure , for that we were on shore filling water : but God , who works all things for the best , would not have it so , and by him we escaped without danger , his name be praised for it .
