& others our friends in the English port , requesting them aid for the recovery of our things , which the other ship called the Santa Maria of S . Vincent ( whereof was Master Johannes de Heart , and Pilot Adame de Lauandote ) had robbed from the Chancewell . To which they answered , that if we would come in unto them in peace , they would assist us what they might . This answer we had the sixt day : and the seventh in the fornoone we arrived in the English port , and cast anchor aloof from the other ships : which done , I went aboard the Admiral , to desire the performance of his promise : who sent for Johannes de Heart , who was contented to restore most of our things again : whereupon I went aboard his ship to have 174 them restored . This day and the eighth I spent in procuring such things as they had robbed ; but yet in the end we wanted a great part thereof . Then we were brief with them , and willed them either to restore us the rest of our things which they had , or else we would both enforce them to do it , and also have satisfaction for our victuals and merchandises which by their means were lost in the Chancewell . The ninth in the morning we prepared our ship to go near unto them . Whereupon their Admiral sent his boat aboard , and desired to speak with me : then I went aboard unto him , and desired to have our things with peace and quietness , proffering to make him and the Master ' s of the two ships of Rochel our umpires , and what they should advice I would stand unto . Hereupon he went aboard the other ship to make peace ; but they would hear no reason , neither yet condescend to restore any thing else which they had of ours . Then I desired that as I came in peace unto them , they would so set me aboard my ship again : which they denied to do , but most unjustly detained me and Stephen van Herwicke
