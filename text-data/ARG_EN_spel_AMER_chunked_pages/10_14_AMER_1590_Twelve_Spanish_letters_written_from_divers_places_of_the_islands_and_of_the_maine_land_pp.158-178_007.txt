that at that time the Englishmen are not departed out of their own country . And thus I rest , from this Island of S . Christopher in Havana this present day on S . Lukes even ; the 17 of October 1590 . Your Worships servant , John de Porva Canavates . A letter from Mexico , of Sebastian Biscaino to his Father Antonio Biscaino in Corchio in Spaine , touching the great profit of the trade to China , and somewhat of M . Thomas Candish . Written the 20 of June 1590 . Aving written to your worship by a friend of mine at large , now I will be somewhat short . And this is only to give you to understand , that foure months past , I came from China , and landed in Acapulco , 70 leagues from Mexico , which is the harbour where the ships that go down to China lie : and all the merchants of Mexico bring all their Spanish commodities down to this harbour , to ship them for that country . It is one of the best harbours in all Nueva Espanna ; and where the ships may ride most safely without all kind of danger . For it lies under a neck of land , and behind a great point . And in this harbour here are foure great ships of Mexico of 600 and 800 tons a piece , which 164 only serve to carry our commodities to China , and so to return back again . The order is thus . From hence to China is above two thousand leagues , farther than from hence to Spaine . And from hence their two first ships depart at one time to China : and are 13 or 14 months returning back again . And when those two ships are returned , then the other twaine two months after depart from hence . They go now from hence very strong with soldiers . I can certify you of one thing ; That 200 ducats in Spanish commodities , and some Flemish wares which I carried with me thither
