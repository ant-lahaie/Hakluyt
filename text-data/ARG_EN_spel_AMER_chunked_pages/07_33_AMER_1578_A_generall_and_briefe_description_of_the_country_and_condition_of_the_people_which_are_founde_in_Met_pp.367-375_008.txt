there , it will presently break forth and show it self , and cannot there by any kind of salve or medicine be cured . Their longest Summers day is of great length , without any dark night , so that in July all the night long , we might perfidy and easily write and read whatsoever had pleased us , which lightsome nights were very beneficial unto us , being so distressed with abundance of ice as we were . The Sun sets to them in the Evening at a quarter of and hour after tenne of the clock , and riseth again in the morning at three quarters of and hour after one of the clock , so that in Summer their Sun shines to 374 them twenty hours and a half , and in the night is absent three hours and a half . And although the Sun be absent these 3 . hours and a half , yet it is not dark that time , for that the Sun is never above three or foure degrees under the edge of their Horizon : the cause is , that the Tropicke of Cancer does cut their Horizon at very uneven and oblique Angles . But the Moon at any time of the year being in Cancer , having North latitude , does make a full revolution above their Horizon , so that sometime they see the Moon above 24 . hours together . Some of our company of the more ignorant sort , thought we might continually have seen the Sun and the Moon , had it not be for two or three high mountains . The people are now become so wary , and so circumspect , by reason of their former losses , that by no means we can apprehend any of them , although we attempted often in this last voyage . But to say truth , we could not bestow any great time in pursuing them , because of our great business in lading , and other things . A . D . 158 ? . A full revolution of the Moon above their Horizon . .
