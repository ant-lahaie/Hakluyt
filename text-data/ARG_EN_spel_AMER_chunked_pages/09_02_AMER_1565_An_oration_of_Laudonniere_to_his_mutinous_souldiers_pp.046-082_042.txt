stuff was brought aboard : so that from that day forward we did nothing but stay for good winds to drive us into France : which had freed us from and infinite number of mischiefs which afterwards we suffered , if they had come as we desired : but it was not Gods good pleasure , as shall appear hereafter . Being thus in a readiness to set sail , we bethought our selves that it would do well to bring certain men and women of the country into France , to the end that if this voyage should be taken in hand again they might declare unto their Kings the greatness of our King , the excellency of our Princes , the goodness of our Country , and the manner of living of the Frenchmen : and that they might also learn our language , to serve our turns thereby in time to come . Wherein I took so good order , that I found means to bring away with me the goodliest persons of all the country , if our intentions had succeeded as I hoped they would have done . In the mean season the Kings my neighbours came often to see and visit me : which , after that they understood that I would return into France , demanded of me whither I meant to return again or no , and whither it should be in short time . I signified unto them that within tenne Moons ( so they TheFloridians call their Months ) I would visit them again with measure their such force , that I would be able to make them Conquerors over all their enemies . They prayed me that the Moon . I would leave them my house , that I would forbid my soldiers to beat down the Fort and their lodge - ix 81 F ings , and that I would leave them a boat to aid them withal in their war against their enemies . Which I made as though I would grant unto them , to the end I might always remain their friend until my last departure . .
