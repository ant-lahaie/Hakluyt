one with the other . The Hands which lie on the right hand , are called Pallamos , and the land on the left , Horotomaka , and the river by which John Dowglas returned within the land from Amana to Capuri , they call Macuri . These Tivitivas are a very goodly people and very 382 valiant , and have the most manly speech and most deliberate that ever I herd , of what nation soever . In the Summer they have houses on the ground , as in other places : in the Winter they dwell upon the trees , where they built very artificiali towns and villages , as it is written in the Spanish story of the West Indies , that those people do in the low lands never the gulf of Uraba : for between May & September the river of Orenoque riseth thirty foot upright , and then are those lands overflown twenty foot high above the level of the ground , saving some few raised grounds in the middle of them : and for this cause they are enforced to live in this manner . They never eat of any thing that is set or so wen : and as at home they use neither planting nor other manurance , so when they come abroad , they refuse to feed of ought , but of that which nature without labour brings forth . They use the tops of Palmitos for bred , and kill deer , fish , and porks , for the rest of their sustenance . They have also many sorts of fruits that grow in the woods , and great variety of birds and fowl . And if to speak of them were not tedious , and vulgar , surely we saw in those passages of very rare colours and forms , not elsewhere to be found , for as much as I have either seen or read . Of these people those that dwell upon the branches of Orenoque , called Capuri and Macureo , are for the most part carpenters of canoas , for they make the most and fairest canoas
