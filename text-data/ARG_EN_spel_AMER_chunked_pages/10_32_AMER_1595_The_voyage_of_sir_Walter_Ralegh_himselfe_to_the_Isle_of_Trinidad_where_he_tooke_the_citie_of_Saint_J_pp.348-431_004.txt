to kill a deer , who like wise men in the absence of their Captain followed the Indians , but were no sooner one harquebus shot from the shore , but Berreos soldiers lying in ambush had them all , notwithstanding that he had given his word to Captain Whiddon that they should take water and wood safely : the other cause of my stay was , for that by discourse with the Spaniards I daily learned more and more of Guiana , of the rivers and passages , and of the enterprise of Berreo , by what means or fault he failed , and how he meant to prosecute the same . While we thus spent the time I was assured by another Cacique of the North side of the island , that Berreo had sent to Margarita and Cumana for soldiers , meaning to have given me a cassado at parting , if it had be possible . For although he had given order through all the island that no Indian should come aboard to trade with me upon pain of hanging & quartering , ( having executed two of them for the same , which I afterwards found ) yet every night there came some with most lamentable complaints of his cruelty , how he had divided the island and given to every soldier a part , that he made the ancient Caciques which were Lords of the country to be their slaves , that he kept them in chains , and dropped their naked bodies with burning bacon , and such other torments , which I found afterwards to be true : for in the city after I entered the same there were 5 . of you lords or little kings ( which they call Caciques in the West Indies ) in one chain 352 1595 - almost dead of famine , and wasted with torments : these are called in their own language Acarewana , and now of late since English , French and Spanish are come among them , they call themselves Captains , because they perceive that the chiefest of every ship is called by that name
