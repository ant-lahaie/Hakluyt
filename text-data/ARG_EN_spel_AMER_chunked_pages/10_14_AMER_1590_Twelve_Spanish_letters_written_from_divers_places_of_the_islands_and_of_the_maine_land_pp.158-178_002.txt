I beseech you to command it to be done ; considering the great charges and expenses that we are at here , as by the accounts your Majesty shall more at large perceive , what hath be spent . These Frigates will be made and end of without all doubt by the month of Februarie : but as yet their tackling and sails are not here arrived : but I do stay the coming thereof every day , according as the Duke of Medina and John de Ibarra have written unto me , that those ships which should bring the same were ready to depart from thence . All these things it behooveth your Majesty to send in time : for I can assure your Majesty that you shall not have upon the sea such good ships as these are . For as touching the other ships of the fleet , which are in this harbour , it is not convenient to venture the silver in them .
