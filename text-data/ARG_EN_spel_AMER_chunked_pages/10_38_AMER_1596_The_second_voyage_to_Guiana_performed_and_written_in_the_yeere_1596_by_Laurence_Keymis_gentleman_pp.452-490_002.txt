we passed we always kept the shore within view and stopped the floods , still ankering at night in three or foure fathom . When we came to the North headland of this Bay ( which we nam Cape Cecyl ) we saw two high mountains like two islands , but they join with the main . In this tract lying Northnorthwest near 60 . leagues , there fallen into the sea these several great rivers , Arrowari , Iwaripoco , Maipari , Coanawini , Caipurogh . we anchored in two fathom not far from these hills , and filled all our cask with fresh water by the ship side , for in the sea thirtie miles from the mouth of any river it is fresh and good . This second Bay extendeth it self above thirtie leagues to the Westward , and containeth within it these rivers Arcooa , Wiapoco , Wanari , Caparwacka , Cawo , Caian , Wia , Macuria , Cawroor , Curassawini . Here leaving the ship at anchor , I took into the boat John Provost , my Indian Interpreter , John Linsey , and eight or nine others , intending to search some of these rivers , and to seek speech with the Indians . In Wiapoco , at the foot of the Eastermost mountain , where the river falls into the sea , we found twentie or thirtie houses , but not inhabited . we stayed there but one night . Wanari we overpassed , because the entrance is rocky and not deep . In Caperwacka we sailed some fourtie miles , but could see no Indian . At one of their ports under the side of a hill , we took in so much Brasill wood as our 454 boat could carry . among other trees we cut down one for and example , which I do verily believe to be the same sort of cinnamon , which is found in the straights of Magellan . From Caperwacka we passed to Cawo , and there met with a Canoa , wherein were two Indians . It was long time before we could procure them
