. As for example , the ii . day of March , when under the Equinoctial it is half hour passed eight of the clock in the morning , the Sun will be in the East about 38 . degrees above the Horizon , because there it riseth always at sixe 256 of the clock , and moveth every hour 15 . degrees , and so high very near will it be with us at London the said eleventh day of March at noon . And therefore look what force the Sun hath with us at noon , the eleventh of March , the same force it seems to have under the Equinoctial at half and hour passed eight in the morning , or rather less force under the Equinoctial . For with us the Sun had be already sixe hours above the horizon , and so had purified and cleansed all the vapours , and thereby his force increased at noon ; but under the Equinoctial , the Sun having be up but two hours and and half , had sufficient to do , to purge and consume the cold and moist vapours of the long night past , and as yet had wrought no effect of heat . And therefore I may boldly pronounce , that there is much less heat at half and hour passed eight under the Equinoctial , then is with us at noon : i fortiori . But in March we are not only contented to have the Sun shining , but we greatly desire the same . Likewise the 11 of June , the Sun in our Meridian is 62 degrees high at London : and under the Equinoctial it is so high after 10 of the clock , and seeing then it is beneficial with us ; A fortiori it is beneficial to them after 10 of the clock . And thus have we measured the force of the Suns greatest heat , the hottest days in the year , under the Equinoctial , that is in March and September , from sixe till after tenne of the clock in the morning , and
