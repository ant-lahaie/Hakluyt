purposed to depart , and sent five of our sailors young men a shore to and Island , to fetch certain fish which we purposed to weather , and therefore left it all night covered upon the Isle : the brutish people of this country lay secretly lurking in the wood , and upon the sudden assaulted our men : which when we perceived , we presently let slip our cables upon the halse , and under our foresail bore into the shore , and with all expedition discharged a double musket upon them twice , at the noise whereof they fled : notwithstanding to our very great grief , two of our men were slain with their arrows , and two grievously wounded , of whom at this present we stand in very great doubt , only one escaped by swimming , with and arrow 406 1586 . shot thorough his arm . These wicked miscreants never offered parley or speech , but presently executed their cursed fury . This present evening it pleased God further to increase our sorrows with a mighty tempestuous storm , the wind being North northeast , which lasted unto the tenth of this month very extreme . We unrigged our ship , and purposed to cut down our masts , the cable of our shutanker brake , so that we only expected to be driven on shore among these Canibals for their prey . Yet in this deep distress the mighty mercy of God , when hope was passed , gave us succour , and sent us a fair lee , so as we recovered our anchor again , and new mored our ship : where we saw that God manifestly delivered us : for the strains of one of our cables were broken , and we only road by and old junke . Thus being freshly mored a new storm arose , the wind being Westnorthwest , very forcible , which lasted unto the tenth day at night . The eleventh day with a fair Westnorthwest wind we departed with trust in Gods mercy , shaping our course for England , and arrived in the West country in the beginning of October . .
