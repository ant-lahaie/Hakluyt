, as before the wind : These Savages followed us so long , that we could not be rid of them : until in the end our General commanded some half dozen harquebusses to be made ready ; and himself struck one of them and the rest shot at them : but they were so yare and nimble , that we could not discern whither they were killed or no , because they could fallen backward into the sea and prevent us by diving . The 14 day of January lying at hull with our ship all the middle watch , from 12 at night until foure in the morning , by the break of day we fell with and headland of the isles of the Philippinas , which is called Cabo deal Spirito Santo which is of very great bigness and length , high land in the midst of it , and very low land as the Cape lies East and West , trending far into the sea to the westward . This cape or island is distant from the isle of Guana , one of the Ladrones , 310 leagues . We were in sailing of this course eleven days with skant winds and some foul weather , bearing no sail two or three nights . This island stands in 13 degrees , and is a place much peopled with heathen people , and all woody through the whole land : and it is short of the chiefest island of the Philippinas called Manilla about 60 leagues . Manilla is well planted and inhabited with Spaniards to the number of sixe or seven hundred persons : which dwell in a town unwalled , which hath 3 or 4 small block houses , part made of wood , and part of stone being indeed of no great strength : they have one or two small Galleys belong to the town . It is a very rich place of gold and many other commodities ; and they have yearly traffic from Acapulco in Nueva Canoas sailing right against the wind . The nimbleness of the people of the Ladrones .
