how to recover our country . Theirreturne . Whereupon with most unwilling minds we returned to our shipping , and with all possible expedition weighed , & so laboured upon the tack to turn out of this very deep bay , being 60 leagues within the point of land . Being out of the bay , we shaped our course for Cape S . Anthony . Our General , whose restless spirit continually laboured to avoid the frowns of fortune , had now plotted with the Bevice and Galeon to go for Newfoundland , and there to revictual , and to have fresh men , of which we stood in good assurance , & so to depart for the Streits of Magellan , and so by his very good policy would have concluded his voyage in the East India , which plate I think it unnecessary here to reveal , being put in principali trust by him . Being thwart Havana , by what chance I know not , but all his ships forsook him the 13 of May , and here in a desperate place he was left desperately alone . The George departed by consent with his letters , the Galeon I know not how : but our misery in the Admiral was very great , for there was not one in the ship that was ever before in the Indies , beside our miserable want of victuals , the danger of the place , and the furious current of the channel . Notwithstanding we were inforced without stay to disemboque : which happily being performed , we shaped our course for Newfoundland . And by Gods mercy we arrived there the fifteenth of June , not having one hours victuals to spare , and there by our countrymen we were well refreshed : where we stayed till the 24 of June , still expecting the Galeon , for the execution of this his last purpose : but she not coming , and that plate overthrown , we returned for England , where we found the right honourable the Earl of Essex bound to the seas , with whom we presently departed in his lordship ' s ship , to do him our humble service . .
