pieces . The captains desired our 421 company ; wherefore we willingly attended on them : who at this time with io . other ships stood for Faial . But the general with the rest of the Fleet were separated from us , making two fleets , for the surer meeting with the Spanish fleet . On Wednesday the 23 . we saw Gratiosa , where the Admiral and the rest of the Queen ' s fleet were come together . The Admiral put forth a flag of counsel , in which was determined that the whole fleet should go for the main , and spread themselves on the coasts of Spaine and Portugal , so far as conveniently they might , for the surer meeting of the Spanish fleet in those parts . The 26 . we came to Faial , where the Admiral with some other of the fleet anchored , othersome plied up and down between that and the Pico until midnight , at which time the Antony shot ofF a piece and weighed , showing his light : after whom the whole fleet stood to the East , the wind at Northeast by East . On Sunday the 27 . towards Evening we took our leave of the Admiral and the whole fleet , who stood to the East . But our ship accompanied with a Flyboat stood in again with S . George , where we purposed to take in more fresh water , and some other fresh victuals . On Wednesday the 30 . of September , seeing the wind hang so Northerly , that we could not attain the Hand of S . George , we gave over our purpose to water there , and the next day framed our due course for England . October . THe 2 . of October in the Morning we saw S . Michaels Hand on our Star board quarter . The 23 . at 10 . of the clock afore noon , we saw Ushant in Britaigne . On Saturday the 24 . we came in safety , God be thanked , to and anchor at Plymmouth . .
