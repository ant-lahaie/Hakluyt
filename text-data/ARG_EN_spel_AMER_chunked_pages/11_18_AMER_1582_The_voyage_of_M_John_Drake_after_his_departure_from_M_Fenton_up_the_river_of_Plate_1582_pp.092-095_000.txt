And extract out of the discourse of one Lopez Vaz a Portugal , touching the fight of M . Fenton with the Spanish ships , with a report of the proceeding of M . John Drake after his departing from him to the river of Plate . Five ships of this fleet cast away on the coast of Spaine . Pon the relation of Pedro Sarmiento concerning the Streits of Magellan , that they might be fortified , and for that the king herd , that there were ships in England preparing for the same streits , he commanded Diego Flores de Valdes a noble man of Spaine , to pass thither with 23 ships , and 3500 men to stop the passage of the Englishmen . There went in this fleet the governor of Chili , with 500 old soldiers that came out of Flanders : but this was the unhappiest fleet of ships that ever went out of Spaine : for before they came from the coast of Spaine a storm took them , and cast away five of the fleet and in them above 800 men , and the 92 rest came into Cadiz . But the king sent them word that they should proceed : and so there went out on the voyage 16 of the ships , for two more of their fleet were much spoiled by the storm which they had . In these sixteene ships Pedro Sarmiento was sent to be governor in the straits , and had assigned unto him 500 men to stay there with him , and he carried with him all kind of Artificers to make him forts , and other necessaries , with great store of ordinance and other munition . This fleet because it was late , did winter on the This fleet coast of Brasil , in the river of Jenero : and from thence they went when the winter was passed , and about the jen ’ er ^ r ° J height of 42 degrees they had a sudden storm , so that Diego Flores beatrice it up and down 22 days , in which time he lost one of the best ships he had , which had in her 300 men and 20 women , that went to inhabit the Streits : and in this ship also was most part of the munition which should have be left in the Streits , so in the end the storm grew to be so great , that the ships were not able to endure it any longer , but were put back unto and Island called Santa Catelina : and there he found a bark wherein were some friars going for the M . Fenton river of Plate :
