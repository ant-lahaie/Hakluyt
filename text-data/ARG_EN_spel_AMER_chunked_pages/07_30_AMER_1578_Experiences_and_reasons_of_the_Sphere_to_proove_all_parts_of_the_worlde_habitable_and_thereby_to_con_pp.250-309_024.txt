influence upon those lands with heat that never ceases during that time , which makes to the great increase of Summer , by reason of the Suns continuance . Therefore it follows , that though the Sun be not there very high over their heads , to cause right angle beams , and to give great heat , yet the Sun being there sometime almost 24 degrees high does cast a convenient and mean heat , which there continueth without hindrance of the night the space of sixe months ( as is before said ) during which time there follows to be a convenient , moderate and Moderate heat temperate heat : or else rather it is to be suspected the under you poles . 271 The Sun never sets in 182 days . Horizon and Equinoctial all one under the pole . heat there to be very great , both for continuance , and also , Quia virtus unita crescit , the virtue and strength of heat united in one increases . If then there be such a moderate heat under the poles , and the same to continue so long time ; what should move the old writers to say there cannot be place for habitation . And that the certainty of this temperate heat under both the poles might more manifestly appear , let us consider the position & quality of the sphere , the length of the day , and so gather the height of the Sun at all times , and by consequent the quantity of his angle , and so lastly the strength of his heat . Those lands and regions lying under the pole , and having the pole for their Zenith , must needs have the Equinoctial circle for their Horizon : therefore the Sun entering into the North signs , and describing every 24 hours a parallel to the Equinoctial by the diurnal motion of Primum mobile , the same parallels must needs be wholly above the Horizon : and so look how many degrees there are from the first of Aries to the last of Virgo , so many whole revolutions
