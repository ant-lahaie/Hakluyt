: wherefore taking in some fresh victuals of the inhabitants being subject to Zichmni , I sailed with a fair wind in three days to Frisland , where the people , who thought they had lost their prince , because of his long absence , in this our voyage received us very joyfully . What followed after this letter I know not but by conjecture , which I gather out of a piece of another letter , which I will set down here underneath : That Zichmni built a town in the port of the Island that he discovered , and that he searched the country very diligently and discovered it all , and also the rivers on 462 c . 1380 - 90 . both sides of Engroneland , for that I see it particularly described in the sea carded , but the discourse or narration is lost . The beginning of the letter is thus . Concerning those things that you desire to know of The 5 letter . me , as of the men and their manners and customs , of the beasts , and of the countries adjoining , I have made thereof a particular book , which by Gods help I will bring with me : wherein I have described the country , the monstrous fish , the customs and laws of Frisland , Island , Estland , the kingdom of Norway , Estotiland , Drogio , and in the end the life of M . Nicolo , the knight our brother , with the discovery which he made , and the state of Groneland . I have also written the life and acts of Zichmni , a prince as worthy of immortali memory , as any that ever lived , for his great valiancy and singular humanity , wherein I have described the discovery of Engroneland on both sides , and the city that he built . Therefore I will speak no further hereof in this letter , hoping to be with you very shortly , and to satisfy you in sundry other things by word of mouth . All these letters were written by M . Antonio to Messer
