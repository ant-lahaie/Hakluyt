you leave both the Hands on the South side , running between the third Hand and the river called Rio deal Bacco , somewhat more from the middle of the channel towards the Hand , which is about a league distant from the other : the channel is tenne fathom deep , with mud and shells upon the ground : the river of 33 Â° Bacco is so shallow , that no ships may enter into it .
