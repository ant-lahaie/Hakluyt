springs , by ebbing and flowing , by rarefaction and condensation . 168 So that it rests not possible ( so far as my simple reason can comprehend ) that this perpetuali current can by any means be maintained , but only by continual reaccess of the same water , which passes thorough the fret , and is brought about thither again , by such circular motion as aforesaid . And the certain falling thereof by this fret into Mar deal Sur is proved by the testimony and experience , of Bernard de la Torre , who was sent from P . de la Natividad to the Moluccae , Anno domini 1542 . by commandment of Anthony Mendoza , then Viceroy of Nova Hispania , which Bernard sailed 750 . Leagues , on the Northside of the Aequator , and there met with a current , which came from the Northeast the which drove him back again to Tidore . Wherefore , this current being proved to come from C . de buona Speranda to the fret of Magellan , and wanting sufficient entrance there , by narrowness of the strait , is by the necessity of nature ' s force , brought to Terra de Labrador , where Jaques Cartier met the same , and thence certainly known , not to strike over upon Island , Lappia , etc . and found by Bernard de la Torre in Mar del Sur , on the backside of America : therefore this current ( having none other passage ) must of necessity , fallen out thorough this our fret into Mar deal Sur , and so trending by the Moluccae , China , and C . de buona Speranda , maintaineth it self by circular motion , which is all one in nature , with Motus ab Orient in Occidentem . A . D . 1576 . The flowing m occasioned by reason that the heat of the moon boileth , and makes the water thin by way of rarefaction . And experience to prove the falling of this current into Mar deal Sur . So that it seems , we have now more
