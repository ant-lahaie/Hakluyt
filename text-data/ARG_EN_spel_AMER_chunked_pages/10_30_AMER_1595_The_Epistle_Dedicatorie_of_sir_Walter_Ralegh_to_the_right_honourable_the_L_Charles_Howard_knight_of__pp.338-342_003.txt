It hath another ground and assurance of riches and glory , then the voyages of the West Indies , and easier way to invade the best parts thereof , then by the common course . The king of Spaine is not so impoverished , by taking three or foure Port towns in America , as we suppose , neither are the riches of Peru , or Nueva Espanna so left by the sea side , as it can be easily washed away with a great flood , or springtide , or left dry upon the sands on a low ebb . The Port towns are few and poor in respect of the rest within the land , and are of little defence , and are only rich , when the Fleets are to receive the treasure for Spaine : and we $ might think the Spaniards very simple , having so many horses and slaves , if they could not upon two days warning carry all the gold they have into the land , and far enough from the reach of our footmen , especially the Indies being ( as they are for the most part ) so mountainous , so full of woods , rivers , and marishes .

Christophoro , the great Cities of Pamplon S . Fe de Bogota , Tunxa and Mozo where the Esmeralds are found , the towns and Cities of Marequita , Velez , la Villam de Leva , Palma , Unda
