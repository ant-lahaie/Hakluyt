mattocks or hoes with long handles : the women with short peckers or parers , because they use them sitting , of a foot long , and about five inches in breadth , do only break the upper part of the ground to raise up the weeds , grass , and old stubs of corn stalks with their roots . The which after a day or two days drying in the Sun , being scrapped up into many small heaps , to save them labour for carrying them away , they burn into ashes . And whereas some may think that they use the ashes for to better the ground , I say that then they would either disperse the ashes abroad , which we observed they do not , except the heaps be too great , or else would take speciali care to set their corn where the ashes lie , which also we find they are careless of . And this is all the husbanding of their ground that they use . Then their setting or sowing is after this manner . First for their corn , beginning in one corner of the plot , with a pecker they make a hold , wherein they put foure grains , with care that they touch not one another ( about and inch asunder ) & cover them with the mould 361 again : and so throughout the whole plot making such holes , and using them after such manner , but with this regard , that they be made in ranks , every rank differing from other half a fathom or a yard , and the holes also in every rank as much . By this means there is a yard spare ground between every hold : where according to discretion here and there , they set as many Beans and Peaze ; in diverse places also among the seeds of Macocquer , Melden , and Planta solis . The ground being thus set according to the rate by us experimented , and English acre containing forty perches in length , and foure in breadth , does there yield
