, which lies to the westward without , with the thick part of the high land which lies most to the West , you shall be passed the bar : and the channel runneth due North . And for your anchoring The best anin the said haven , see that you carefully seek the midst of the said Thick land , which lies in the bottom of the said haven : for you must anchor between two banks of sand , where the passage is but narrow . And you must anchor surely : for there goes T53 a great tIED : for the Sea runneth there as swiftly and more then in . There is good ground and ankorage here : and you shall ride in three fathom water . And within the said haven there is nothing to hurt you , for you are free from all winds . And if by chance you should be driven Westward of the said haven , you may seek and entrance , which is right over against the small Island nam before , which is called The Isle of Cormorants ; and you may enter in there as at the other haven at a full sea : And you must pass upon the West side , and you shall find on the Bar at a full sea fourteene foot water , and great depth when you are entered in : for the Sea runneth very swiftly in that place : and the entry thereof lies Southeast and Northwest . Right over against you on the other side , you may pass with boats at a full sea . And all these entrances make all but one haven , which is good within . I say this , because I have passed into the main Sea by the one and the other passage . And the said Isle is not passed two leagues over in the midst . It is but two banks of sand , whereof one is like to that of S . Malo , which let the Sea from passing through the midst of all the Isle : But the two ends are high mountains with Islands altogether cut and separated with streams and rivers . To anchor in the said harbour , you must not ride farther then five or sixe cables length from the said haven . .
