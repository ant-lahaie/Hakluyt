looking still when the pinnace should be prepared to go for the place where Ferdinando his friend Alanson was : but that day passed , and we saw no preparation for landing in Hispaniola . The 4 of July , sailing along the coast of Hispaniola , until the next day at noon , and no preparation yet seen for the staying there , we having knowledge that we were passed the place where Alanson dwelled , and were come with Isabella : hereupon Ferdinando was asked by the Governor , whither he meant to speak with Alanson , for the taking in of cattle , and other things , according to his promise , or not : but he answered that he was now past the place , and that Sir Walter Ralegh told him , the French Ambassador certified him , that the king of Spaine had sent for Alanson into Spaine : wherefore he thought him dead , and that it was to no purpose to touch there in any place , at this voyage . The next day we left sighed of Hispaniola , and haled oflf for Virginia , about foure of the clock in the afternoon . The sixt of July we came to the Island Caycos , wherein Ferdinando said were two salt ponds , assuring us if they were dry , we might find salt to shift with , until the next supply : but it proved as true as finding of sheep at Baque . In this Island , whilst Ferdinando solaced himself ashore , with one of the company , in part of the Island , others spent the latter part of that day in other parts of the Island , some to seek the salt ponds , some fowling , some hunting Swans , whereof we caught many . The next day early in the morning we weighed anchor , leaving Caycos , with good hope , that the first land that we saw next should be Virginia . About the 16 of July we fell with the main of Virginia , which Simon Ferdinando took to be the Island of 390 THE FOURTH VOYAGE TO VIRGINIA a . d . 1587 Croatoan ,
