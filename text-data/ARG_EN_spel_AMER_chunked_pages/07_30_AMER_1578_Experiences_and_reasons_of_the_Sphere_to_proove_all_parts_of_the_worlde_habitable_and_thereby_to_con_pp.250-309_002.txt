Seas , woods and lake ' s etc . may cause through their sundry kind of situation , sundry strange and extraordinary effects , which the reason of the climb otherwise would not give . I mention these Voyages of our Englishmen , not so much to prove that Torrida Zona may be , and is inhabited , as to show their readiness in attempting long and dangerous Navigations . we also among us in England have black Moors , . / Ethiopians , out of all parts of Torrida Zona , which after a small continuance , can well endure the cold of our Country , and why should not we as well abide the heat of their Country ? But what should I name any more experiences , seeing that all the coasts of Guinea and Benin are inhabited of Portugals , Span - 252 yards , French , and some Englishmen , who there have built Castles and Towns . Only this I will say to the Merchant ' s of London , that trade yearly to Marochus , it is very certain , that the greatest part of the burning Zone is far more temperate and cool in June , then the Country of Marochus , as shall appear by these reasons and experiences following . For let us first consider the breadth and bigness of this burning Zone ( which as every man knoweth , is 47 . degrees ) each Tropicke , which are the bounders thereof , being 23 . degrees and a half distant from the Equinoctial . Imagine again two other Parallels , on each side the Equinoctial one , either of them distant from the Equinoctial about 20 . degrees , which Parallels may be described either of them twice a year by the Sun , being in the first degrees of Gemini the 11 . of May , and in Leo the 13 . of July , having North latitude .
