turns towards the Northeast other 35 leagues , & from thence the coast turns towards the West . Before this gulf stands the Island of Trinidad , and towards the West doth appear the gulf of Paria like to half a round circle , after the fashion of a Diameter , and at the end of this circle is the entery in of Paria , & at this entery there is between the land and the Island 8 leagues , and on the other side there is but little space between the Hand and the land , but it is deep , and hath a good entry : this Hand of Trinidad hath in length 25 leagues , and as many in breadth , and 21 A . D . I5l8 . stands in eight degrees , and is inhabited of many people , and as yet not under subjection . Here the Indians do use to shoot with bows and arrows which are of a fathom in length , made of reeds , which grow in that Country , and at the end of them is artificially joined a piece of wood very strong , unto the which piece of wood at the end of it , they put a bone of a fish , in place of and arrow head : these kind of bones be harder then Diamonds , and every one of them be three or foure fingers long , & they are taken out of a fish that hath three of these bones , one upon the back , another under every wing : but that which grows upon the back is the strongest and the greatest . In this Island the people says that there grows gold : and in this Island and in Paria grow redes so great , that they make staves of them and carry of them into Spaine . Likewise there be Popinjays very great and gentle , and some of them have their foreheads yellow , and this sort do quickly learn to speak , and speak much . There be likewise in the gulf of Paria pearls , although not many , but very good and great . .
