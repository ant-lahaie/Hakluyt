was no body could teach them our belief & religion , we excused our selves , desiring Taignoagny , & Domagaia , to tell the rest of their countrymen , that he would come again another time , & bring Priests & chrisome with us , for 240 without them they could not be baptised : which they did easily believe , for Domagaia & Taignoagny had seen many children baptised in Britain while they were there . Which promise when they herd they seemed to be very glad . They live in common together : and of such commodities as their country yields they are indifferently well stored , the inhabitants of the country cloth themselves with the skins of certain Wild beasts , but very miserably . In winter they wear hosen and shoes made of wild beasts skins , and in Summer they go barefooted . They keep and observe the rites of matrimony , saving that every one weddeth 2 or 3 wives , which ( their husbands being dead ) do never marry again , but for the death of their husbands wear a certain black weed all the days of their life , besmearing all their faces with coaldust & grease mingled together as thick as the back of a knife , and by that they are known to be widow ' s . They have a filthy and detestable use in marrying of their maidens , and that is this , they put them all ( after they are of lawful age to marry ) in a common place , as harlots free for every man that will have to do with them , until such time as they find a match . This I say , because I have seen by experience many housen full of those Damosels , even as our schools are full of children in France to learn to read . Moreover , the misrule and riot that they keep in those houses is very great , for very wantonly they sport and dally together , showing whatsoever God hath sent them . They are no men of great labour .
