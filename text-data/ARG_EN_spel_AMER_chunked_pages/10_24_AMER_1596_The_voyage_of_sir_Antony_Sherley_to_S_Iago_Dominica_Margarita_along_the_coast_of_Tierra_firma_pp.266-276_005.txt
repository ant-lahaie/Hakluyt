. Being now master ' s of the town , we presently by the Generals direction ( whose skill , spirit , and diligence can never have sufficient commendation ) barricadoed up all the streets , and brought our selves into a very convenient strength . After we had be sixe hours in the town the Portugals still coming in great multitudes to the upper fort , began to sally down upon us , and to assault us at every barricado : so that in the first assault they slew and wounded eighty of our men , to our very great weakening . But they had small cause of triumph , for their loss was thrice more then ours : but they still 270 .... I596 â€™ prosecuted their assault , not giving us time either to sleep or eat , so that we were in exceeding extremity ; for their forces did daily increase to the number of three thousand persons : but we daily lost of our poor number . Whilst we were thus keeping the town , our ships came about unto us , who received many dangerous shot from the upper castle . Our general finding himself thus straighted , & discreetly looking into the policy and strength of the enemy , and scarce able to defend any one assault more , sent to the forts and to his ships that about ten of the clock in the dark of the night they should shoot at the upper fort with all possible diligence , and send all the boats ashore , which was accordingly performed . And we likewise keeping a tumult in the town , the enemy supposing that our purpose was to assault the upper fort , ( which God knows was most impregnable for us ) retired from their plotted purpose for the defence thereof . So we in a soldierlike order with very good safety departed the town , although the Portugals having espied our Generals policy came very furiously upon the back of us , after we had kept it two days and two nights . In the road of S . Iago we took a ship with wine and cloth , which did greatly refresh our men . From hence
