high land , on the East side having the form of a mine of brimstone or fiery hill , and on the West side the land runneth downward at the point thereof being round like 329 a loaf of bred : in the channel between it and the Vereies , there are 18 . fathom deep with small black sand . From the aforesaid channel of Vereies and Marinduque , we held our course Westnorthwest twelve leagues to the land of Mindora , to the point or hook called Dumaryn , lying full under thirteene degrees : Five leagues forward from the said channel on the South side we left and Hand called Isla deal maestro del Campo , that is , The Hand of the Colonel , lying under twelve degrees and which is a small and flat Hand : In this course we had 45 fathom deep , with white sand . By this point or end of the Hand Marinduque begins the Hand of Myndoro , which hath in length East and West five and twentie leagues , and in breadth twelve leagues , whereof the furthest point Southward lies under thirteene degrees , and the furthest point Northward under thirteene degrees and f . and the furthest point Westward under thirteene degrees . This Hand with the Hand of Lu ? on makes a channel of five leagues broad , and ten or twelve fathom deep with muddy ground of diverse colours , with white sand . Five leagues forward from Marinduque lies the river of the town of Anagacu , which is so shallow , that no ships may enter into it . From thence two leagues further lie the Hands called Bacco , which are three Hands lying in a triangle , two of them being distant from the land about three hundred cubits , and between them and the land you may pass with small ships : And from the land to the other Hand , are about two hundred cubits , where it is altogether shallows and sands , so that where the ships may pass outward about 150 . cubits from the land ,
