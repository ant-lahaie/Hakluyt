so weary , that to amend the one , and refresh the other , they must of necessity seek into harbour . But on the other side it was argued again to the contrary , that to seek into harbour thereabouts , was but to subject themselves to double dangers : if happily they escaped the dangers of Rocks in their entering , yet being in , they were nevertheless subject there to the danger of the Ice , which with the swift tides and currents is carried in and out in most harboroughs thereabouts , and may thereby gaul their Cables asunder , drive them upon the shore , and bring them to much trouble . Also the coast is so much subject to broken ground and rocks , especially in the mouth and entrance of every Harbour , that albeit the Channel be sounded over and over again , yet are you never the nearer to discern the dangers . For the bottom of the Sea holding like shape and form as the Land , being full of hills , dales , and ragged Rocks , suffers you not by your soundings to know and keep a true guess of the depth . For you shall found upon the side or hollowness of one Hill or Rock under water , and have a hundreth , fiftie , or fourtie fathom depth : and before the next cast , year you shall be able to heave your led again , you shall be upon the top thereof , and come aground to your utter confusion . Another reason against going to harbour was , that the cold air did threaten a sudden freezing up of the sounds , seeing that every night there was new congealed ice , even of that water which remained within their ships . And therefore it should seem to be more safe to lie ofF and on at Sea , then for lack of wind to bring 352 them forth of harbour , to hazard by sudden frosts to be shut up the whole year . After many such dangers and reasons alleged , and large debating of
