omnipotent God , shall take our desired effect ( whereof there is no just cause of doubt . ) Then shall her Majesties dominions be enlarged , her highness ancient titles justly confirmed , all odious idleness from this our Realm utterly banished , diverse decayed towns repaired , and many poor and needy persons relieved , and estates of such as now live in want shall be embettered , the ignorant and barbarous idolaters taught to know Christ , the innocent defended from their bloody tyrannical neighbours , the diabolical custom of sacrificing humane creatures abolished . All which ( no man doubteth ) are things grateful in the sighed of our Saviour Christ , and tending to the honour and glory of the Trinitie . Bee of good cheer therefore , for he that cannot err hath said : That before the end of the world , his word shall be preached to all nations , Which good work I trust is reserved for our nation to accomplish in these parts : Wherefore my deer countrymen , be not dismayed : 13 Â° for the power of God is nothing diminished , nor the love that he hath to the preaching and planting of the Gospel any whit abated . Shall we then doubt he will be less ready most mightily and miraculously to assist our nation in this quarrel , which is chiefly and principally undertaken for the enlargement of the Christian faith abroad , and the banishment of idleness at home , then he was to Columbus , Vasques , Nuns , Hernando Cortes , and Francis Pizarro in the West : and Vasques de Gama , Peter Alvares , & Alonso de Albuquerque in the East ? Let us therefore with cheerful minds and courageous hearts , give the attempt , and leave the sequel to almighty God : for if he be on our part , what forceth it who bee against us ? Thus leaving the correction and reformation unto the gentle Reader , whatsoever is in this treatise too much or too little , otherwise unperfect , I take leave , and so end . .
