to Lima , and there the Captain was executed with the other two , but the boys be yet living . The King of Spaine having intelligence of these matters , sent 300 men of war against those Negroes which had assisted those English men , which before were slaves unto the Spaniards , and as before is said , 80 ! 575 - fled from their master ' s unto those mountains , and so joined themselves to the Englishmen , to the end they might the better revenge themselves on the Spaniards . At the first coming of these 300 soldiers , they took many of the Negroes , and executed great justice upon them : But after a season , the Negroes grew wise and wary , and prevented the Spaniards , so that none of them could be taken . The Spaniards of that country marveiled much at this one thing , to see that since the conquering of this land , there have be many Frenchmen , that have come to those Countries ' , but never saw English men there but only those two of whom I have spoken . And although there have many Frenchmen be on the coast , yet never durst they put foot upon land , only those two English men adventured it , and did such exploits , as are before remembered . All these things coming to the hearing of the The English king of Spaine , he provided two Galleys well appointed to keep those coasts : and the first year they took â€™ sixe or seven French ships . And after that this was king of Spaine known , there were no more Englishmen or Frenchmen to built galleys of war that durst adventure to approach the coast , the until this present year 1586 , that the aforesaid Francis ' Drake , with a strong fleet of 24 ships arrived there , and made spoil of Santo Domingo , Carthagena , and S . Augustine , things that are known to all the world . But it is likely that if the King of Spaine live , he will in time provide sufficient remedy , to keep his countries ' and subject ' s from the invasion of other nations . x 81 .
