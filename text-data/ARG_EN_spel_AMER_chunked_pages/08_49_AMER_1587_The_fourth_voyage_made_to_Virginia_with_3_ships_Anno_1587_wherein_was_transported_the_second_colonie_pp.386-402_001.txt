that instant his mouth set on such a burning , that it was strange to see how the infant was tormented for the time : but after 24 hours , it beware away of it self . Also the first night of our being on this Island , we took five great Torteses , some of them of such bigness , that sixteene of our strongest men were tired with carrying of one of them but from the sea side to our cabins . In this Island we found no watering place , but a standing pond , the water whereof was so evil , that many of our company fell sick with drinking thereof : and as many as did but wash their faces with that water , in the morning before the Sun had drawn away the corruption , their faces did so burn and swell , that their eyes were shut up , and could not see in five or sixe days , or longer . 387 â€œ One of the Isles of the Indies inhabited with Savages . Circumspection to be used in strange places . The second day of our abided there , we sent forth some of our men to search the Island for fresh water , three one way , and two another way . The Governor also , with sixe others , went up to the top of and high hill , to view the Island , but could perceive no sign of any men , or beasts , nor any goodness , but Parots , and trees of Guiacum . Returning back to our cabins another way , he found in the dissent of a hill , certain potsherds of savage making , made of the earth of that Island : whereupon it was judged , that this Island was inhabited with Savages , though Fernando had told us for certain the contrary . The same day at night , the rest of our company very late returned to the Governor . The one company affirmed , that they had scene in a valley eleven Savages , and diverse houses half a mile distant from the steep , or top of the hill where they stayed .
