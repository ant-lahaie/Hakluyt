convenient place of reflections . Also 261 A black Moors son born in England . The colour of the people in Meta Incognita . The complexion of the people of Meta incognita . the middle region of the air where all the hail , frost , and snow is engendered , is nearer unto the Sun then the earth is , and yet there continueth perpetuali cold , because there is nothing that the Sun beams may reflect against , whereby appears that the nearness of the body of the Sun works nothing . Therefore to return again to the black Moors . I my self have seen and Ethiopian as black as a coal brought into England , who taking a fair English woman to wife , begat a son in all respects as black as the father was , although England were his native country , and and English woman his mother : whereby it seems this blackness proceedeth rather of some natural infection of that man , which was so strong , that neither the nature of the Climb , neither the good complexion of the mother concurring , could any thing altar , and therefore , we cannot impute it to the nature of the Climb . And for a more fresh example , our people of Meta Incognita ( of whom and for whom this discourse is taken in hand ) that were brought this last year into England , were all generally of the same colour that many nations be , lying in the midst of the middle Zone . And this their colour was not only in the face which was subject to Sun and air , but also in their bodies , which were still covered with garments as ours are , yea the very sucking child of twelve months age had his skin of the very same colour that most have under the Equinoctial , which thing cannot proceed by reason of the Climb , for that they are at least ten degrees more towards the North then we in England are , No , the Sun never comes near their Zenith by
