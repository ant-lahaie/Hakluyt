dispossessed him as well of the said ship , as of the treasure in the same , and forthwith put our captain with violence on shore , where he arid one Germane Weiborne fought together , and were both wounded . After this our captain desirous to come on board , was resisted by the persons aforesaid , who answered him that he should not come on board till they were ready to depart . Our men had appointed ten persons of their company for the keeping of this Island of S . Francisco : but about break of the day , on a certain morning , sixtie Spaniards arriving secretly in the Island , surprised our people on the sudden , what time there were thirtie of our men on shore : in which surprise they slew our captain , M . Andrew Barker with eight others , namely , one Wild of Bristol , and Michael our Chirurgeon , Richard of Bristol , Thomas Sampoole , Thomas Freeman , Thomas Nightingale , Robert Jackson , Walter Newton ; and the captains boy and one other were hurt . Now after that William Coxe , and the rest ( which were aboard the bark ) perceived that the captain , & some others were slave , he received them that were living into the ship , having before that time refused some of them . After this misfortune they went to and Island distant from thence a league , where Coxe divided a chain of gold ( which was found in the captains chest after his death ) among the company . After this Coxe went in a pinesse ( which we took at the Isle of Sant Francisco ) with certain others of our men in a skyffe , to the town of Truxillio , in the bay of Honduras , 86 which town they surprised , and had therein wine and oil as much as they would , and diverse other good things , but no gold nor silver , nor any other treasure which they would confess . But before they could return to their company , those that were in the barks were had in chase by men of war , whereby they were enforced every man to shift for himself : so for haste they left those that were in the skiff ( being 8 persons ) in the bay of Honduras : what became of them afterwards God knoweth .
