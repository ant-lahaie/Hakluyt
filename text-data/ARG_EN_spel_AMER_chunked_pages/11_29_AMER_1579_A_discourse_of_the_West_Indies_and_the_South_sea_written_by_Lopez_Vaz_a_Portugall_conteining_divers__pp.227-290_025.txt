to the East Indies : and the foresaid Pedro Alvarez took possession of this land for the king of Portugall : whereupon the king DONE Emanuel hearing news thereof sent presently ships to discover the whole country , and found it to be part of America otherwise called The West Indies : for which cause there grew some controversy between him and the king of Spaine : but being kinsmen and great friends one to another , they agreed in the end , that the king of Portugall should hold all the country that he had discovered , the which was ( as I have said ) from the river of Marannon to the river of Plate ; albeit the Spaniards affirm , that it stretcheth no further then the Hand of Santa Catelina ; whereupon there have risen many controversies between the Portugales and Spaniardes , which have cost many men their lives . 248 There came into the said river of Plate in the year 1587 two English ships and a Pinnace of the right Honourable the Earl of Cumberland , which were bound for the straights of Magellan , and ankored ten leagues within the said river before a little Hand lying hard by another called Seal - Hand . On which Hand the Captain of one of the ships called Christopher Lister , and his whole company landing , found the king of Portugales arms graved on a rock by the sea side ; which are thought to have been there engraven by one Martin Alonso de Souza , who was sent by the king DONE Emanuel to discover this coast . Therefore I think the Portugales have reason for that which they allege concerning the extension of the said coast of Brasil . Wherefore the king of Portugal ! gave this land to diverse of his gentlemen to inhabit . Most of the natural inhabitants of this country are very rude , and go Stark naked both men and women , and are maneaters ; for which cause they make wars one against another to get men to eat ; they are stout and good bowmen
