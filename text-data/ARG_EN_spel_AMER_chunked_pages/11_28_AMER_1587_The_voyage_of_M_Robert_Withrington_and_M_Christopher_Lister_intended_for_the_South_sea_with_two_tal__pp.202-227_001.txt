, whereupon our Admiral lent him a piece of Ordinance , which they repaid double , so that we grew to some little quarrel , whereupon one of the sternemost hulks , being as I suppose more afraid then hurt , stroke amain , our Admiral being near him , laid him aboard , and entered with certain of his men , how many I know not , for that we were giving chase to the Windermost men , thinking our Admiral would have come up again to us , to have made them all to have stroke : but the weather growing to be very thick and foggy , with small rain , he came not up but kept with another of the hulks which Captain Hawes had boarded and kept all night , and took out of her some provision that they best liked . They learned of the men that were in the hulk , that there were 7 . hulks laden in Lisbone with Spaniards goods , and because their lading was very rich , they were determined to go about Ireland , and so they let her go again like a goose with a broken wing . The next day after being the 21 . day , we espied 5 . sails more , which lay along to the Eastwards , but by 203 reason of the night which then was near at hand , we could hardly come to them . Yet at last we hailed one of the biggest of them , & they told us that they were all of Hamborough : but another said she was of Denmark , so that indeed they knew neither what to say , nor what to do . Our Admiral being more desirous to follow his course , then to linger by chasing the hulks , called us from pursuing them with his trumpet , and a piece of Ordinance , or else we would have seen what they had be , and wherewith they had be laden . The 22 . day because of contrary wind we put into Dartmouth all 4 . of us , and tarried there seven days
