be tumbled down upon her ? Ob . 4 . Well , grant the West Indies not to continue continent unto the Pole , grant there be a passage between these two lands , let the gulf lie nearer us then commonly in cards we find it set , namely , between the 61 . and 64 . degrees north , as Gemma Frisius in his maps and globes imagineth it , and so left by our countryman Sebastian Cabot in his table which the Earl of Bedford hath at Cheinies : Let the way be void of all difficulties , yet doth it not follow that we have free passage to Cathayo . For examples sake : You may trend all Norway , Finmarke , and Lappeland , and then bow Southward to Saint Nicholas in Moscovia : you may likewise in the Mediterranean Sea fetch Constantinople , and the mouth of Tanais : yet is there no passage by Sea through Moscovia into Pont Euxine , now called Mare Maggiore . Again , in the aforesaid Mediterranean sea , we sail to Alexandria in Egypt , the Barbarians bring their pearl and spices from the Molucca ' s up the Read sea or Arabian gulf to Sues , scarcely three days journey from the aforesaid haven : yet have we no way by sea from Alexandria to the Molucca ' s , for that Isthmos or little straight of land between the two seas . In like manner although the Northern passage be free at 61 degrees of latitude , and the West Ocean beyond America , usually called Mar deal Zur , known to be open at 40 . degrees elevation from the Island Japan , yea three hundred leagues Northerly above Japan : yet may there be land to hinder the thorough passage that way by Sea , as in the examples aforesaid it falls out , Asia and America there being joined together in one continent . Ne can this opinion seem altogether frivolous unto any one that diligently peruseth our Cosmographers doings . Josephus Moletius is of that mind , not only in his plain Hemispheres
