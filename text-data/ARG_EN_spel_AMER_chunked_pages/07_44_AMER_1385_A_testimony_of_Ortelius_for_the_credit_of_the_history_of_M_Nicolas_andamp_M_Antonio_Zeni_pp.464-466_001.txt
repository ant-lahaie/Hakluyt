; but especially gold , wherewith they mightily abound . They traffic with the people of Groneland : from whence they fetch skins , pitch and brimstone . The inhabitants report that towards the South , there are regions abounding with gold , and very populous : they have many and huge woods , from whence they take timber for the building of ships and cities , whereof and of castles there are great store . The use of the loadstone for Navigation is unknown unto them . They make relation also of a certain region towards the South , called Drogio , which Drogio . is inhabited by Canibals , unto whom men flesh is delicate meat : whereof being destitute they live by fishing , which they use very much . Beyond this are large regions , and as it were a new world : but the people are barbarous and go naked : howbeit against the cold they cloth themselves in beasts skins . These have no kind of metal : and they live by hunting . Their weapons are certain long staves with sharp points , and bows . They wage wars one against another . They have governors , and obey certain laws . But from hence vii 465 2 G more towards the South the climate is much more temperate : and there are cities , and temples of idols , unto whom they sacrifice living men , whose flesh they afterwards devour . These nations have the use of silver and gold . Thus much of this tract of lands out of the aforesaid collections or abridgements . Wherein this also is worthy the observation , that even then our Europaean Pilots sailed those seas by the help of the loadstone . For concerning the use thereof in Navigation , I suppose there is not to be found a more ancient testimony . And these things I have annexed the rather unto this table of Mar deal Zur ; considering that none of those Authors which have written the Histories of the New world , have in any part of their writings , mentioned one word thereof . Hitherto Ortelius . .
