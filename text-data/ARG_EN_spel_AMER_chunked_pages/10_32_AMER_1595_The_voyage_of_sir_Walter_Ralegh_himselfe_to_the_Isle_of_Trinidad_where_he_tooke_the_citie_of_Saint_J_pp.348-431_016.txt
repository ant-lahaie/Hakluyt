reason of the hard success which all these and other Spanyards found in attempting the same , whereof I will speak briefly , though impertinent in some Read sort to my purpose . This Pedro de Osua had among ^ An ^ ta h * s trouPs a Biscain , called Agiri , a man meanly born , ' who bore no other office then a sergeant or alferez : but after certain months , when the soldiers were grieved with travels , and consumed with famine , and that no entrance could be found by the branches or body of Amazones , this Agiri raised a mutiny , of which he made himself the head , and so prevailed , as he put Osua to the sword , and all his followers , taking on him the whole charge and commandment , with a purpose not only to make himself emperor of Guiana , but also of Peru , & of all that side of the West Indies : he had of his party seven hundred soldiers , and of those many promised to draw in other captains and companies , to deliver up towns and forts in Peru : but neither finding by you said river any passage into Guiana , nor any possibility to return towards Peru by the same Amazones , by reason that you descent of the river made so great a current , he was enforced to disemboque at the mouth of the said Amazones , which can not be less then a thousand leagues from the place where they embarked : from thence he coasted the land till he arrived at Margarita to the North of Mompatar , which is at this day called Puerto de Tyranno , for that he there slew DONE Juan de villam Andreda , governor of Margarita , who was father to DONE 362 Juan Sarmiento , governor of Margarita when sir John Burgh landed there , and attempted the Island . Agiri put to the sword all other in the Island that refused to be of his party , and took with him certain Simerones , and other desperate companions .
