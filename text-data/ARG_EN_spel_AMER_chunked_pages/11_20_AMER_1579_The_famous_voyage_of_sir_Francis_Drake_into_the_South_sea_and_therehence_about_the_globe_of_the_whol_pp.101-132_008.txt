and gave us understanding of a safe harbour that they had found , wherewith all our ships bore , and entered it , where we watered and made new provision of victuals , as by Seals , whereof we slew to the number of 200 . or 300 . in the space of and hour .

They were very agill people and quick to deliver , and seemed not to be ignorant in the feats of 108 wars , as by their order or ranging a few men , might appear . These people would not of a long time receive any thing at our hands ; yet at length our general being ashore , and they dancing after their accustomed manner about him , and he once turning his back towards them , one leapt suddenly to him , and took his cap with his gold band off his head , and ran a little distance from him and shared it with his fellow , the cap to the one , and the band to the other . Having dispatched all our business in this place , we departed and set sail , and immediately upon our setting forth we lost our Canter which was absent three or foure days : but when our General had her again , he took out the necessaries , and so gave her over near to the Cape of Good hope
