A relation of the first voyage and discovery of the Isle Ramea , made by for Monsieur de La court Pre Ravillon , and Grand Pre , with the ship called the Bonaventure , to kill and make Train oil of the beasts called the Morses with great teeth , which we have performed by Gods help this year 1591 .
