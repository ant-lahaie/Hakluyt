The third and last voyage unto Meta Incognita , made by M . Martin Frobisher , in the year 1578 . Written by Thomas Ellis . Hese are to let you know , that upon the 25 . of May , the Thomas Allen being Viceadmiral whose Captain was M . Yorke , M . Gibbes Master , Christopher Hall Pilot , accompanied with the Rear - admiral nam the Hopewel , whose Captain was M . Henrie Carewe , the M . Andrewe Dier , and certain other ships came to Gravesend , where we anchored and abided the coming of certain of our Fleet which were not yet come . The 27 . of the same month our Fleet being now come together , and all things pressed in a readiness , the wind favouring , and tide serving , we being of sails in number eight , weighed anchors and hoist our sails towards Harwich to meet with our Admiral , and the residue which then and there abided our arrival : where we safely arrived the 28 . thereof , finding there our Admiral , whom we with the discharge of certain pieces saluted , according to order and duty , and were welcomed with the like courtesy : which being finished we landed : where our general continued mustering his soldiers and Miners , and setting things in order appertaining to the voyage until the last of the said month of May , which day we hoist our sails , and committing our selves to the conducting of Almighty God , we set forward towards the west Country in such lucky wise and good success , that by the fift of June we passed the Dursies , being the utmost part of Ireland to the Westward . And here it were not much amiss nor far from our purpose , if I should a little discourse and speak of our adventures and chances by the way , as our landing at Plimmouth , as also the meeting certain poor men , which were robbed and spoiled of all that they had by 231 Master forks .
