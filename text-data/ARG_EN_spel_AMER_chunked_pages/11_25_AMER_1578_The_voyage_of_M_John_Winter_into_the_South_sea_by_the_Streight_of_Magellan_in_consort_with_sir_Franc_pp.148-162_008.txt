to the Southwards : the other stayed until the 14 in the morning and then ran to sea , not being able to ride . In the mean time while the Marigold road under the shore , our general with certain of his men went 154 on land , where they saw two naked men , saving that they had a certain skin ne wrapped about their shoulders and rolls upon their heads . To whom our General showed a white cloth , in sign of friendship , who with certain gestures of their bodies and hands , showed the like to him again , speaking likewise and making a noise , which our men could not understand , but they would in no case come near our men . Our general went the next day to the same place again : but he had no sighed of the foresaid men or any other . Howbeit he found certain fowls , as Ostriches , and other Ostriches and sea fowls , which the said men had newly killed , and seafoules - laid them on and heap together , as though they had done that for our men of purpose . There was also a certain bag with little stones of diverse colours , which together with the victuals our General brought aboard , and then weighed , and came to sea the 15 of the said month : where all the rest of the fleet met with him , save the Prize , and the flyboat . The 16 day we ran into a bay to the Southwards of Cape Hope , where we road all that night . The next morning our general weighed , & ran without the cape to the Northwards , & sent the Elizabeth towards the South to look for the Prize : leaving the Marigold and the Canter to search if in the bay they could find any fit harbour for our ships . The same day being the 14 of May , our General met with the flyboat ( which lost us the 27 of April ) and brought her into said bay .
