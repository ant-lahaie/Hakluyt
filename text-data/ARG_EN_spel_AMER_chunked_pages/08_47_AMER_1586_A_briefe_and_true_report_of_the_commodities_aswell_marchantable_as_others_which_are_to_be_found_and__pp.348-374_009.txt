, which is to be deemed Silver . For confirmation whereof , at the time of our first arrival in the country , I saw , with some others with me , two small pieces of Silver grossly beaten , about the weight of a testron , hanging in the ears of a 356 Wiroans or chief lord that dwelled about fourescore miles from us : of whom through inquiry , by the number of days and the way , I learned that it had come to his hands from the same place or near , where I after understood the Copper was made , and the white grains of metal found . The aforesaid Copper we also found by trial to hold Silver . Pearl . Sometime in feeding on Muscles we found some Pearl : but it was our happen to meet with rags , or of a pide colour : not having yet discovered those places where we herd of better and more plenty . One of our company , a man of skill in such matters , had gathered together from among the Savage people about five thousand : of which number he chosen so many as . thousand made a fair chain , which for their likeness and fea ^ s uniformity in roundness , orientness , and pidenesse of * â€˜ many excellent colours , with equality in greatness , were very fair and rare : and had therefore been presented to her Majesty , had we not by casualty , and through extremity of a storm lost them , with many things else in coming away from the country . Sweet gums of diverse kinds , and many other Apothecary drug , of which we will make speciali mention , when we shall receive it from such men of skill in that kind , that in taking reasonable pains shall discover them more particularly then we have done , and then now I can make relation of , for want of the examples I had provided and gathered , and are now lost , with other things by casualty before mentioned .
