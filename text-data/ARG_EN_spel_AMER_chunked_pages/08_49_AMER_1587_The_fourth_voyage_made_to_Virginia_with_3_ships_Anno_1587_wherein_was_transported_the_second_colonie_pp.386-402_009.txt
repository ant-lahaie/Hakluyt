calling to them by friendly signs , that but two of their chiefest men should come unarmed to speak with those two Savages , who seemed also to be unarmed . Wherefore two of the chiefest of our Englishmen went gladly to them : but whilst one of those Savages traitorously embraced one of our men , the other with his sword of wood , which he had secretly hidden under his manteli , struck him on the head and slew him , and presently the other eight and twenty Savages showed them selves : the other Englishman perceiving this , fled to his company , whom the Savages pursued with their bows , and arrows , so fast , that the Englishmen were forced to take the house , wherein all their victuali , and weapons were : but the 394 THE FOURTH VOYAGE TO VIRGINIA a . d . . 1587 - Savages forthwith set the same on fire : by means whereof our men were forced to take up such weapons as came first to hand , and without order to run forth among the Savages , with whom they skirmished above and hour . In this skirmish another of our men was shot into the mouth with and arrow , where he died : and also one of the Savages was shot into the side by one of our men , with a wild fire arrow , whereof he died presently . The place where they fought was of great advantage to the Savages , by means of the thick trees , behind which the Savages through their nimbleness , defended themselves , and so offended our men with their arrows , that our men being some of them hurt , retired fighting to the water side , where their boat lay , with which they fled towards Hatorask . By that time they had rowed but a quarter of a mile , they espied their foure fellows coming from a creek thereby , where they had be to fetch Oysters : these foure they received into their boat , leaving Roanoak , and landed on a little Island on the right hand of our entrance into the harbour of Hatorask
