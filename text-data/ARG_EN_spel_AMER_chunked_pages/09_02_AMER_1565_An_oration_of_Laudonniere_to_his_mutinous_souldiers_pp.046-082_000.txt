Laudonnieres A JY friends , you know the cause why our king sent ' muthtw oul us unto country ; you know that he is our jurs â€™ natural Prince , whom we are bound to obey according to the commandment of God , in such sort , that we ought neither to spare our goods nor lives to do those things that concern his service : you know , or at least you cannot be ignorant , that beside this general and natural obligation , you have this also joined thereunto , that in receiving of him reasonable pay and wages , you are bound to follow those whom he hath established over you to be your governors , and to command you in his name , having for this purpose given him and oath of fidelity , which you cannot by any means revoke for any fair appearance which you have to do the contrary : for this is reason , that seeing you live upon his charges on this condition , ( this is reason I say ) that you should be faithful unto him . Notwithstanding you have had more regard unto your unbridled affections then unto virtue , which invited you to the observance of your oath , in such sort that being become contemners of all honesty , you have passed your bonds , and thought that all things were lawful for you . Whereupon it is fallen out , that while you thought to escape the justice of men , you could not avoid the judgement of God , which as a thing by no means to be avoided hath led you , and in spite of you hath made you to arrive in this place , to make you confess 46 how true his judgements are , and that he never suffers so foul a fault to escape unpunished . After that I had used unto them these or the like speeches , following that which we had agreed upon in council , in respect of the crimes which they had committed , aswell against the kings Majesty as against me which was their Captain ,
