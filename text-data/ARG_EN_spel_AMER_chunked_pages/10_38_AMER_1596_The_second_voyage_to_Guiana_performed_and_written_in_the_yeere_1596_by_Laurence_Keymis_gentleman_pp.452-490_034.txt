yield us ? No doubtless , if the return of Berreo his Campmaster with tenne of these ships be compared with precedent advertisements concerning him : it will appear more then probable , that the Guiana - golde waged these men and shipping : and that they are now more careful to obtain this place , then to keep others , which they have already got , which note , except in matters of extraordinary account , is not incident to their policy and proceedings . Again , it cannot be thought that either it was senseless madness in the governors of Margarita , and the Caracas , to bring their states and lives in question , by seeking , contrary to their kings order , to enter Guiana , and kill Berreo with his followers : or else the abundance of pearl in Margarita , and the gold mines in the Caracas , seeming matters of small account : Guiana only was in their judgement , rich , plentiful , and able of it self to redeem their trespass and offence , how great soever it should be .
