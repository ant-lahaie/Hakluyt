at sea , and yet durst not be overbold to walk abroad : and after understanding that there were certain English ships at S . Lucar bound for England , I took a boat and went aboard one of them , and desired the Master that I might have passage with him to go into England , and told him secretly that I was one of those which Captain Hawkins did set on shore in the Indies : he very courteously prayed me to have him excused , for he durst not meddle with me , & prayed me therefore to return from whence I came . Which when I perceived , with a sorrowful heart , God knoweth , I took my leave of him , not without watty cheeks . And then I went to S . Marry port , which is 3 . leagues from S . Lucar , where I put my self to be a soldier to go in the king of Spaines Galleys , which were bound for Majorca , and coming thither in He comes the end of the Christmas holidays , I found there two X English ships , the one of London , and the other of thee from Majorca . West country , which were ready freighted and stayed but for a fair wind . To the Master of the one , which was of the West country went I , and told him that I had be 2 . years in Spaine to learn the language , and that I was now desirous to go home and see my friends , for that I lacked maintenance : and so having agreed with him for my passage , I took shipping . And thus through the providence of Almighty God , after 16 . years absence , having sustained many and sundry great troubles and 444 misery ' s , as by this discourse appears , I came home to this my native country of England in the year 1582 . in the month of February , in the ship called the Landret , and arrived at Pool . .
