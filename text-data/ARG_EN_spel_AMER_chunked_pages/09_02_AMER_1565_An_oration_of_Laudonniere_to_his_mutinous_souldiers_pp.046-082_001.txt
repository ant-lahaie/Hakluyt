I commanded that they should be hanged . Seeing therefore that there was no starting hold , nor means at all to save themselves from this arrest , they took themselves unto their prayers : yet one of the foure , thinking to raise a mutiny among my soldiers , said thus unto them : What , brothers and companions , will you suffer us to die so shamefully ? And taking the word out of his mouth , I said unto him , that they were not companions of authors of sedition and rebels unto the kings service . Hereupon the soldiers besought me not to hang them , but rather let them be shot thorough , & then afterwards , if I thought good , their bodies might be hanged upon certain gibbets along the havens mouth : which I caused presently to be put in execution . Loe here what was the end of my mutinous soldiers , without which I had always lived peaceably , and enjoyed the good desire which I had to make and happy and quiet voyage . But because 1 have spoken of nothing but their accidents and adventures which happened unto them after their departure , without making any mention of our fort , I will return to the matters from which I digressed , to declare that which fell out after their departure . First I began to consider to the end I might confirm and make my self more constant in mine affliction , that these murmurers could not ground their sedition upon want of victuals : for from the time of our arrival , every soldier daily unto this day , and beside until the eight and twentieth of February , had a loaf of bred weighing two and twenty ounces .
