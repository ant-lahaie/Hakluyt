Also ( the Lord be praised for it ) in all this dangerous fight , we had not one man slain , and . but 2 . hurt : but our sails and ropes were so rend with their shot , that it was wonderful to behold : our main mast also was shot clean through , whereby we were in exceeding great danger . Thus our consorts forsook us , and left us in these extremities . The next day being the 14 . of June in the morning , we saw all our adversaries to leeward of us , and they espying us , chased us till 10 . of the clock , and then seeing they could not prevail , gave us over . So that day about 5 . of the clock in the afternoon , we bore up to the Southwest , in hope to find our consorts , but we had no sighed of them at that time , nor afterwards . Then stood we in all that night for the Cape of S . Anthonie , hoping there to see our Admiral according to his direction . The 15 . day of June early in the morning , we descried the Spanish fleet again , being within 5 . leagues of Cape S . Anthonie . Then ( having no sighed of our consorts ) we stood for the place according to the direction of our owner sir George Carey , where we did ply for the space of 23 . days , and never could see any sail but two frigates , which we gave chase unto the 24 . of June , and could not fetched them up . Thus we give God most humble thanks for our safe deliverance from the cruel enemy , which hath been more mighty by the providence of God , then any tongue can express : to whom be all praise , honour , and glory , both now and ever , Amen .
