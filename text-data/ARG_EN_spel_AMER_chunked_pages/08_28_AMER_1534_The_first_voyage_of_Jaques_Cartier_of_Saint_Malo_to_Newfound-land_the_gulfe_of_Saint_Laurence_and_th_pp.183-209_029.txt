where the sea is intermingled with marishes and shallows , the space of twentie leagues : then does the land begin to trend from West to Eastnortheast altogether environed with Islands two or three leagues from land , in which as far as we could see , are many dangerous shelves more then foure or five leagues from land . How that upon the ninth of August we entered within White Sands , and upon the fift of September we came to the Port of S . Malo . FRom the said Wednesday until Saturday following , we had a great wind from the Southwest , which caused us to run Eastnortheast , on which day we came to the Easterly parts of Newfoundland , between the Granges and the Double Cape . There began great stormy winds coming from the East with great rage : wherefore we coasted the Cape Northnorthwest , to search the Northern part , which is ( as we have said ) all environed with Islands , and being near the said Islands and land , the wind turned into the South , which brought us within the said gulf , so that the next day being the 9 of August , we by the grace of God entered within the White Sands . And this is so much as we have discovered . After that , upon the 15 of August , being the feast of the Assumption of our Lady , after that we had herd service , we altogether departed from the port of White Sands , and with a happy and prosperous weather we came into 208 the middle of the sea , that is between Newfoundland and Britanie , in which place we were tossed and turmoiled three days long with great storms and windy tempests coming from the East , which with the aid and assistance of God we suffered : then had we fair weather , and upon the fift of September , in the said year , we came to the port of S . Malo whence we departed . A . D . 1534 - .
