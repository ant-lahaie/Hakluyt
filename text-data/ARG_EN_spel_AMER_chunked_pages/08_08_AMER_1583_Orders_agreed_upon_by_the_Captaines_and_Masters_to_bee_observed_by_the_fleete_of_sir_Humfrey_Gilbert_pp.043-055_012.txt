possession taken in the right of her Majesty , and to the behoof of Sir Humfrey Gilbert knight , his heirs and assigns for ever : the general granted in fee farm diverse parcels of land lying by the water side , both in this harbour of S . John , and elsewhere , which was to the owners a great commodity , being thereby assured ( by their proper inheritance ) of grounds convenient to dress and to dry their fish , whereof many times before they did fade , being prevented 54 SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT by them that came first into the harbour . For which grounds they did covenant to pay a certain rend and service unto sir Humfrey Gilbert , his heirs or assigns for ever , and yearly to maintain possession of the same , by themselves or their assigns . Now remained only to take in provision granted , according as every ship was taxed , which did fish upon the coast adjoining . In the mean while , the general appointed men unto their charge : some to repair and trim the ships , others to attend in gathering together our supply and provisions : others to search the commodities and singularities of the country , to be found by sea or land , and to make relation unto the general what either themselves could know by their own travail and experience , or by good intelligence of English men or strangers , who had longest frequented thee same coast . Also some observed the elevation of the pole , and drew plots of the country exactly graded . And by that I could gather by each men several relation , I have drawn a brief description of the Newfound land , with the commodities by sea or land already made , and such also as are in possibility and great likelihood to be made : Nevertheless the Cards and plots that were drawing , with the due gradation of the harbors , bays , and capes , did perish with the Admiral : wherefore in the description following , I must omit the particulars of such things . .
