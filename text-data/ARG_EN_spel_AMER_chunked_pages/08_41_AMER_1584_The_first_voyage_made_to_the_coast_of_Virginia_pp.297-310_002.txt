the Sea overflowed them , of which we found such plenty , as well there as in all places else , both on the sand and on the green soil on the hills , as in the plains , as well on every little shrub , as also climbing towards the tops of high Cedars , that I think in all the world the like abundance is not to be found : and 298 my self having seen those parts of Europe that most abound , find such difference as were incredible to be written . We passed from the Sea side towards the tops of The Isle of those hills next adjoining , being but of mean highth , and from thence we beheld the Sea on both sides to the North , and to the South , finding no end any of both ways . This land lay stretching it self to the West , which after we found to be but and Island of twentie miles long , and not above sixe miles broad . Under the bank or hill whereon we stood , we beheld the valleys replenished with goodly Cedar trees , and having discharged our harquebus - shot , such a flock of Cranes ( the most part white ) arose under us , with such a cry redoubled by many echos , as if and army of men had shouted all together . This Island had many goodly woods full of Dear , Conies , Hares , and Foul , even in the midst of Summer in incredible abundance . The woods are not such as you find in Bohemia , Moscovia , or Hercynia , barren and fruitless , but the highest and reddest Cedars of the world , Goodly far bettering the Ceders of the Azores , of the Indies , or ^ ars ' _ Lybanus , Pynes , Cypress , Sassafras , the Lentisk , or the saphras ^ ' tree that bears the Mastic , the tree that bears the rind of black Cinnamon , of which Master Winter brought from the straights of Magellan , and many other of excellent smell and quali tie . We remained by the side of this Island two whole days
