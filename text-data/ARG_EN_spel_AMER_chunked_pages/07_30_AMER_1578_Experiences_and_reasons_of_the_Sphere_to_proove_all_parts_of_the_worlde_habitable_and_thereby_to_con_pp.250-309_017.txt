of the night doth cool and refresh the same again , the Sun being as long absent in the night , as it was present in the day . Also our Author of the Sphere , Johannes de Sacro Bosco , in the Chapter of the Zodiac , deriveth the Etymologic of Zodiacus , of the Greek word Zoe , which in Latin signifies Vita , life ; for out of Aristotle he allegeth , that Secundum accessum & recessum solis in Zodiaco , fiunt generationes & corruptiones in rebus inferioribus : according to the Suns going to and from in the Zodiac , the inferior bodies take their causes of generation and corruption . Then it follows , that where there is most going too and from , there is most generation and corruption : which must needs be between the two Tropickes ; for there the Sun goes too and from most , and no where else but there . Therefore between thee Under the two Tropikes , that is , in the middle Zone , is greatest Equinoctiallis increase , multiplication , generation , and corruption of things , which also we find by experience ; for there is ' Summer twice in the year , and twice Winter , so that they have two Harvests in the year , and continual Spring . Seeing then the middle Zone falls out so 265 Greatest heat under the Tropics . temperate , it rests to dedare where the hottest part of the world should be , for we find some places more hight then others . To answer this doubt , reason persuadeth , the ho test place in the world to be under and about the two Tropickes ; for there more then in any other place do both the causes of heat concur , that is , the perpendicular falling of the Sun beams , at right angles , and a greater continuance of the Sun above the Horizon , the Pole there being elevated three or foure and twentie degrees . And as before I concluded , that though the Sun were perpendicular to them under the
