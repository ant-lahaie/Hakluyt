Angle and by his continuance . Note this reason . heat is the less for any effect that the Angle of the Sun beams make . Yet because we have a longer continuance of the Suns presence above our Horizon then they have under the Equinoctial ; by this continuance the heat is increased , for it shines to us 16 . or 18 . hours sometime , when it continueth with them but twelve hours always . And again , our night is very short wherein cold vapours use to abound , being but sixe or eight hours long , whereas theirs is always twelve hours long , by which two advantages of long days and short nights , though we want the equality of Angle , it comes to - passe that in Summer our heat here is as great as theirs is there , as hath be proved by experience , and is nothing dissonant from good reason . Therefore whosoever will rightly weigh the force of cold and heat in any region , must not only consider the Angle that the Sun beams make , but also the continuance of the same above the Horizon . As first to them under the Equinoctial the Sun is twice a year at noon in their Zenith perpendicular over their heads , and therefore during the two hours of those two days the heat is very urgent , and so perhaps it will be in foure or five days more and hour every day , until the Sun in his proper motion have crossed the Equinoctial ; so that this extreme heat caused by the perpendicular Angle of the Sun beams , endureth but two hours of two days in a year . But if any man say the Sun may scalde a good while before and after it come to the Meridian , so far forth as reason leads , I am content to allow it , and therefore I will measure and proportion the Suns heat , by comparing the Angles there , with the Angles made here in England , because this temperature is best known unto us
