as we have said ) they determined Theirretume . to depart thence , and to return towards the land of the Christians , which they put in execution in the beginning of July 1583 , being guided by and Indian that went with them , who led them another way then they went forth by , down a river , which they called Rio de las vacas ; that the las is to say , The river of oxen , in respect of the great multitudes of oxen or kine that fed upon the banks thereof , by the which they traveled for the space of 120 . leagues , still meeting with store of the said cattle . 120 . Leagues . From hence they went forward to the river of Conchos by which they entered , and thence to the valley of S . Bartholomew , from whence they first entered into their discovery . Upon their coming thither they found that the said Friar Bernardin Beltran and his company were safely arrived at the said town many days before , & were gone from thence to the town of Guadiana . In Guadiana . 203 this town the foresaid captain Antony de Espejo made most certain relation of all that is aforesaid , which relation presently he sent unto the Cond of Corunna Vizroy of Nueva Espanna , who sent the same to his Majesty , & to the Lords of his royal counsel of the Indies , to the end they might take such order as they thought best , which they have already performed with great care and circumspection . Almighty God vouchsafe his assistance in this business , that such numbers of souls redeemed by his blood may not utterly perish , of whose good capacity , wherein they exceed those of Mexico and Peru ( as we be given to understand by those that have dealt with them ) we may boldly presume that they will easily embrace the Gospel , and abandon such idolatry as now the most of them do live in : which Almighty God grant for his honour and glory , and for the increase of the holy Catholic faith . .
