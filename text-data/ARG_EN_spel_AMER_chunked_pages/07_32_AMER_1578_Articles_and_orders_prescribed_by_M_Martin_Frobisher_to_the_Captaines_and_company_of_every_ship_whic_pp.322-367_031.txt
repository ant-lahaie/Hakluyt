the Moon being consort always with the Anne Francis , and keeping very good company plied up together into the straights , with great desire to recover their long wished Port : and they attempted as often , and passed as far as possible the wind , weather , & ice gave them leave , which commonly they found very contrary . For when the weather was clear and without fog , then commonly the wind was contrary . And when it was either Easterly or Southerly , which would serve their turns , then had they so great a fog and dark mist therewith , that either they could not discern way thorough the ice , or else the ice lay so thick together , that it was impossible for them to pass . And on the other side , when it was calm , the Tides had force to bring the ice so suddenly about them , that commonly then they were most therewith distressed , having no Wind to carry them from the danger thereof . And by the sixt of August being with much ado god up as high as Leicester point , they had good hope to find the Souther shore clear , and so to pass up towards their Port . But being there becalmed and lying a hull openly upon the great Bay which comes out of the mistaken straights before spoken of , they were 35 Â° so suddenly compassed with ice round about by means of the swift Tides which run in that place , that they were never afore so hardly beset as now . And in seeking to avoid these dangers in the dark weather , the Anne Francis lost sighed of the other two Ships , who being likewise hardly distressed , signified their danger , as they since reported , by shooting ofF their ordinance , which the other could not hear , nor if they had herd , could have given them any remedy , being so busily occupied to wind themselves out of their own troubles . The Fleeboate called the Moon , was here heaved The Moon .
