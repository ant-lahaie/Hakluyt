themselves too weak , with our help to displant the Spaniardes : to set some of them on work , for hatchet ' s and knives to return us gold grains , and white stones from such places , as they should be directed unto .

My Indian showed me in what sort without digging they gather the gold in the sand of a small river , nam Macawini , that springs and falls from the rocks where this mine is .
