TESTIMONIES OF THE AMAZON broad and as much beaten , as the ways between Salamanca and Validolid : and this was when the great entrance or discovery was made by the great river of the Amazones or Marannon by Pedro de Orsua , and afterwards by others that succeeded him : and they supposing that Dorado which they sought , was farther up in the country , did not inhabit there , and afterwards returned without discovering Dorado ( which they never found ) and without that great province which they left .

Arannon lies in seven degrees and and half Northward of the Equinoctial , it is a great river , and hath more then fifteene leagues in breadth eight leagues within the land . It hath many islands , and in this river within the land fortie leagues there is near to the said river a mountain , whereupon grow trees of Incense , the trees be of a good height , & the boughs thereof be like to Plumtrees , and the Incense doth hang at them , as the ice doth at the tiles of a house in the winter season when it doth freeze . In this river were taken foure Indians in a small boat , called in the Indian language a Canoa , that came down by the river , and there were taken from them two stones of Emeralds , the one of them being as great as a men hand . They said that so many days journey going upward by the river , they found a rock of that stone .
