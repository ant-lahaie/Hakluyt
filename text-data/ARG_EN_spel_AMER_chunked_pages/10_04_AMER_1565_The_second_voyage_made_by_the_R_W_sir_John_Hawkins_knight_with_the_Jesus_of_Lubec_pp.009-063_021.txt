all the Indians to them and fled into the mountains , as we were partly certified , and also saw the experience our selves , by some of the Indians coming to see us who by three Spaniards a horseback passing hard by us , went unto the Indians , having every one of them their bows , and arrows , procuring them away , who before were conversant with us . Here perceiving no traffic to be had with them , nor yet water for the refreshing of our men , we were driven to depart the twentieth day , and the 2 and twentieth we came to a place in the main called Cumana , whither the Captain going in his Pinnisse , spoke with certain Spaniards , of whom he demanded traffic , but they made him answer , they were but 26 SIR JOHN HAWKINS soldiers newly come thither , and were not able to by one Negro : whereupon he asked for a watering place , and they pointed him a place two leagues off , called Santa F ^ , where we found marvelous goodly watering , and commodious for the taking in thereof : for that the fresh water came into the Sea , and so our ships had aboard the shore twentie fathom water . Near about this place , inhabited certain Indians , who the next day after we came thither , came down to us , presenting mill and cakes of bread , which they had made of a kind of corn called Maiz , in bigness of a peas , the ear whereof is much like to a teasell , but a span in length , having thereon a number of granes . Also they brought down to us Hens , Potatoes and Pines , which we bought for beads , pewter whistles , glasses , knives , and other trifles . These Potatoes be the most delicate roots that may be eaten , and do far exceed our passeneps or carets . Their pines be of the bigness of two fists , the outside whereof is of the making of a pineapple ,
