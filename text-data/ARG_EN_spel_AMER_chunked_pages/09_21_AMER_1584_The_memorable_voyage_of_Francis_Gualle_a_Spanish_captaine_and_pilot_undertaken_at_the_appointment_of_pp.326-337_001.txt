space of eighteene leagues to the point or entry of the channel , which runneth in between that Hand and the Hand of Lu ^ on . This point or entry lies scarce under 12 . degrees . All the coast that stretcheth from the entry of the channel to the point of El capo del Spirito santo , is not very fair . Eight leagues from the said point lies a haven of indifferent greatness , called Baya de Lobos , that is , The Bay of wolves , having a small Hand in the mouth thereof : and within the channel about half a league from the end of the said Hand lies and Hand or clifFe , & when you pass by the point in the middle of the channel , then you have five and twentie fathom deep , with brown sand : there we found so great a stream running Westward , that it made the water to cast a skum as if it had been a sand , whereby it put us in fear , but casting out our led , we found five and twentie fathom deep . From the aforesaid entry of the channel North , and North and by East about tenne leagues , lies the Island of Catanduanes , about a league distant from the land of Lu ^ on , on the furthest point Eastward , and from the same entry of the channel towards the West and Southwest lies the Hand Capuli about sixe leagues from thence , stretching Westsouth west , and Eastnortheast , being five leagues long , and foure leagues broad : and as we passed by it , it lay Northward from us under twelve degrees and | . and somewhat high land . Foure leagues from the aforesaid Hand of Capuli Northwestward lie the three Hands of the haven of Bollon in the 327 Hand of Lufones , stretching North and South about foure leagues , distant from the firm land half a league , whereof the furthest Southward lies under thirteene degrees : In this channel it is twentie fathom deep , with white sand
