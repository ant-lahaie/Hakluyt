from two until Sun set . And this is concluded , by respecting only the first . cause of heat , which is the consideration of the Angle of the Sun beams , by a certain similitude , that whereas the Sun shines never above twelve hours , more then eight of them would be cool and pleasant even to us , much more to them that are acquainted always with such warm places . So there remains less then foure hours of any excessive heat , and that only in the two Summer days of the year , that is the eleventh day of March , and the foure - vii 257 R teenth of September : for under the Equinoctial they have two Summers , the one in March , and the other in September , which are our Spring and Autumn : and likewise two Winter ' s , in June and December , which are our Summer and Winter , as may well appear to him that hath only tasted the principles of the Sphere . But if the Sun be in either Tropicke , or approaching near thereunto , then may we more easily measure the force of his Meridian altitude , that it striketh upon the Equinoctial . As for example , the twelfth of June the Sun will be in the first degree of Cancer . Then look what force the heat of the Sun hath under the Equinoctial , the same force and greater it hath in all that Parallel , where the Pole is elevated between fourtie and seven , Paris in . and fourtie and eight degrees . And therefore Paris in France ss as prance the twelfth day of June sustaineth more heat of the Equinoc - the Sun , then Saint Thomas Hand lying near the tiall in June , same Meridian doth likewise at noon , or the Hands Taprobana , Moluccae , or the firm land of Peru in America , which all lie underneath the Equinoctial . For upon the twelfth day of June aforesaid , the Sun beams at noon do make and Isoscheles Triangle ,
