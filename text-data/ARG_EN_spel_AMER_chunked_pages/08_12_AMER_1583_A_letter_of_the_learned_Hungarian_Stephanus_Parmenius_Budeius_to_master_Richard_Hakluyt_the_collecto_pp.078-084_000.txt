To the worshipful , Master Richard Hakluit at Oxford in Christchurch Master of Arts , and Philosophic , his friend and brother . I Had not purposed to write unto you , when the promise of your letters came to my mind : You thought in June last to have followed us your self , and therefore I had left order that you should be advertised of my state , by Master Doctor Humfrey : but so you would not be satisfied : I will write therefore to you almost in the same words , because I have no leisure at this time , to meditate new matters , and to vary or multiply words . The ii . of June we set sail at length from England in good earnest , and departed , leaving the haven and land behind us at Plimmouth : our Fleet consisted of five ships : the greatest , which the Admirals brother had lent us , withdrew her self from us the third day , we know not upon what occasion : with the rest we sailed still together till the 23 . of July : at which time our view of one another being intercepted by the great mists , some of us sailed one way , and some another : to us alone the first land appeared , the first of August , about the latitude of 50 . degrees , when as before we had descended beyond 41 . degrees in hope of some Southerly winds , which notwithstanding never blue to us at any fit time . v It is and Island which your men call Penguin , because of the multitude of birds of the same name . Yet we neither saw any birds , nor drew near to the land , the winds serving for our course directed to another place , but we met altogether at that place a little before the Haven , whereunto by common Council we had determined to come , and that within the space of two hours by the great goodness of God , and to our great joy . The place is situate in Newfound land , between 47 . and vni 81 F A . D . . 1583 . 48 . degrees , called by the name of Saint Johns :
