gold came , nor yet what store was in the land . These Indians use to go to sea in great Canoas that will carry 100 men a piece , wherein they have many conflicts one against another : howbeit unto the Christians 288 they could do no great hurt ; for that with a small pinnace and two falcons a few may overcome 100 of them . At this place foureteene men mistrusting nothing , rowed to land , to take in fresh water , whom on the sudden certain Indians in foure Canoas set upon , took the ships boat , and slew all the men therein : wherefore a man cannot go on shore too strong , nor yet be too wary in a strange land . Hereupon the Spaniards went on shore in their pinnace , and burned the town , A town burned . and in this town they found the small grains of gold before mentioned . They were discovering of these Islands from one to another about foureteene months , at the end of which time ( because that upon the coast where they were , the wind continuing still in one place , might be and occasion of longer tarrying ) they consulted which way to return . Southward they durst not go for fear of great tempests which are that way usual : wherefore sailing to the North of the line , they fell with the coast of Nueva Espanna ; on which coast they met with such terrible storms , that they were forced to cut their main masts over - bourd , and to lie nine months beating it up and down in the sea , before they could get into any harbour of the Christians . In which time by reason of evil government , and for lack of victuals and fresh water , most of the men in their Admiral died ; for five whole days together they had neither water nor meat : but in the other ships they behaved themselves so well , that the greater part of them came safe unto the land .
