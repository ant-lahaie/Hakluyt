the castles and ships gave us a hundreth eighty and five great shot , beside small shot abundance . They had also sunk a great ship in the mouth of the channel and rafted it over with her masts almost to the very forts and castles , so as they thought it impregnable . The frigates had in each of them twenty pieces of brass , and a hundreth barrels of powder . Their chief lading that they brought thither was silk , oil , and wine . The treasure which they went to fetch , which was brought thither in a ship called the Vigonia , was conveyed into the strongest and surest castle of defence ; being , as one of the prisoners confessed , three millions of ducats or five and thirty tons of silver . Also they had sent all the women , children , and unable persons into the woods , and left none but soldiers and fighting men in the town . The fight on our side was resolute , hight , and dangerous : wherein we lost some forty or fifty men , and so many were hurt . There was also great death of the Spaniards aboard the frigates , with burning , drowning , and killing , and beside some taken prisoners . The 14 we road still , being within shot of the uttermost castle : but they fearing the next night we would come in again , began to warp up the other 4 frigates , beginning first with the Admiral : which whither by chance or their own wills we saw to sink ; and as we suppose so did they with all the rest , or else by stealth god up farther within their chiefest forces . The 15 also we road still , and at afternoon we espied a caravel coming from the castle point : but before our pinnaces could fetch her up , she ran on shore , where our boats could not come at her because of the breach , and also many of the Islanders came down to guard her with shot .
