he found his entertainment and answer so contrary to his expectation , that in fine he was constrained to hide himself a long space in the Court of Roan , about the year 1570 . And without the assistance of President Marigny , in whose house he remained certain days , and of the Receiver of Vacquieulx , which always was his faithful friend , he had been in great danger . Which grieved not a little Dominique de Gourgues , considering the services which he had done aswell unto him as to his predecessors kings of France . He was The birth , born in Mount Marsan in Guyenne , and employed for lifiand death the service of the most Christian Kings in all the Armies made since these twentie five or thirtie years : at last he had the charge and honour of a Captain , which in a place near unto Siene , with thirtie Soldiers sustained the brunt of a part of the Spanish Army , by which being taken in the assault , and having all his men cut in pieces , he was put into a Galley in token of the good war and singular favour which the Spanyard is wont to show us . But as the Galley was going towards Sicillie , being taken by the Turkes , led away to Rhodes , and thence to Constantinople , it was shortly afterward recovered by Romeguas , commander over the Army of Malta . By this mean returning home , he made a Voyage on the coast of Africa , whence he took his course to Bresil , and to the South Sea . At length being desirous to rapayre the honour of France , he set upon Florida with such success as you have herd . So that being become by his continual warlike actions both by Land and Sea no less valiant Captain then skilful Mariner , he hath made himself feared of the Spanyard , and acceptable unto the Queen of England for the desert of his virtues . To conclude , he died in the year 1582 , to the great grief of such as knew him . .
