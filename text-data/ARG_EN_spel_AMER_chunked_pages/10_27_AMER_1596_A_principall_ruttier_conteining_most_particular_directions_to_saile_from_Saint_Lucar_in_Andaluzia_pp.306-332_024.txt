midst thereof a round hill , and upon the Southwest side by the sea you shall see a low even land foure or five leagues long , and a low point , and this point of the hill is called La sierras de Cabanca ; and then begins the bay of Cayo Romano : and ahead the sierras you shall see a round loaf which is in the midst of the same bay , and ahead of that you shall see a hill flat on the top like a table sixe or seven leagues , which hill is not very high , and from these hills to Cayo Romano you have five and thirtie leagues , and you must stir the one half of the course Northwest , and the other half Northwest and by West , and so shall you make or see the said Cayo Romano upon the larboard side of you . Note , that from Cayo Romano to Cabo de Cruz you have three leagues , and they lie North and South one from another . 328 Romano is and high Island , and lies Northeast Southwest , and stretcheth it self as it were 4 . leagues : and coming on it Northeast & Southwest , it makes a loaf or round heap or homock ; in the midst This Island lies ioo . leagues from Havana . there are two saddles , as we term them , or low partitions , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and coming with it North and South , it makes all one low send or saddle in the midst . And if night should come on you at this Cayo Romano , enter not the channel , because in the mid way is and Isle , flat , or Cayo , which lies North and South with Cayo Romana , and it is called Cayo de la Cruz : and at full sea you shall discern a heath , which this Cayo hath in the midst of it , which is like to a sail ; but all night bear but your foresail a glass one way
