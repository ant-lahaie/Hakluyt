At this present in this storm many of the Fleet were dangerously distressed , and were severed almost all asunder . Yet , thanks be to God , all the Fleet arrived safely in England about the first of October , some in one place and some in another .

This aforesaid North sea is the same which lies upon the back side of Frobishers straits , where first the general himself in his Pinnaces , A . D . 1578 . And unknown channel into the Northeast , discovered by the Buss of Bridgewater . and after some other of our company have discovered ( as they affirm ) a great foreland , where they would have also a great likelihood of the greatest passage towards the South sea , or Mar deal Sur . The Buss of Bridgewater , as she came homeward , to A fruitful the Southeastward of Friseland , discovered a great Island in the latitude of 57 degrees and and half , which was â€˜ never yet found before , and sailed three days alongst the coast , the land seeming to be fruitful , full of woods , and a champion Country . There died in the whole Fleet in all this voyage not above forty persons , which number is not great , considering how many ships were in the Fleet , and how strange fortune ' s we passed . .
