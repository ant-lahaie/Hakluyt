not discerned all along the coast of America , in such sort as Jaques Cartier found it : Whereunto I answer this : that albeit , in every part of the Coast of America , or elsewhere this current is not sensibly perceived , yet it hath evermore such like motion , either in the uppermost or nethermost part of the sea : as it may be proved true , if you sink a sail by a couple of ropes , near the ground , fastening to the nethermost corners two gun chambers or other weights : by the driving whereof you shall plainly perceive , the course of the water , and current , running with such course in the bottom . By the like experiment , you may find the ordinary motion of the sea , in the Ocean : how far soever you be ofF the land . 9 Also there comes another current from out the Northeast from the Scythian Sea ( as M . Jenkinson a man of rare virtue , great travail and experience , told me ) which runneth Westward towards Labrador , as the other did , which comes from the South : so that both these currents , must have way thorough this our fret , or else encounter together and run contrary courses , in one line , but no such conflicts of streams , or contrary courses are found about any part of Labrodor , or Terra nova , as witness our yearly fishers , and other sailors that way , but is there digested , as aforesaid , and found by experience of Barnard de la Torre , to fallen into Mar deal Sur . 10 Furthermore , the current in the great Ocean , could not have been maintained to run continually one way , from the beginning of the world unto this day , had there not been some thorough passage by the fret aforesaid , and so by circular motion be brought again to maintain it self : For the Tides and courses of the sea are maintained by their interchangeable motions : as fresh rivers are by
