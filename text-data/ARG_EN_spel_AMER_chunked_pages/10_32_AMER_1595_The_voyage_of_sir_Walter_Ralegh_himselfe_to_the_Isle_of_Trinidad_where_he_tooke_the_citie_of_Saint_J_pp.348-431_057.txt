these are very valiant , or rather desperate people , and have the most strong poison on their arrows , and most dangerous of all nations , of which poison I will speak somewhat being a digression not unnecessary . There was nothing whereof I was more curious , then to find out the true remedies of these poisoned arrows : for beside the mortality of the wound they make , the par tie shot endureth the most insufferable torment in the world , and abideth a most ugly and lamentable death , sometime dying stark mad , sometime their bowels breaking out of their bellies : which are presently discoloured as black as pitch , and so unsavoury , as no man can endure to cure , or to attend them . And it is more strange to know , that in all this time there was never Spaniard either by gift or torment that could attain to the true knowledge of the cure , although they have martyred and put to invented torture I know not how many of them . But every one of these Indians know it not , no not one among thousands , but their soothsayers and priests , who do conceal it , and only teach it but from the father to the son . Those medicines which are vulgar , and serve for the ordinary poison , are made of the juice of a root called Tupara : the same also quenches marvellously the heat of burning fevers , and heals inward wounds , and broken veins , that bleed within the body . But I was more beholding to the Guianians then any other : for Anthonio de Berreo told me that he could never attain to the knowledge thereof , and yet they taught me the best way of healing as well thereof , as of all other poisons . Some of the Spaniards have be cured in ordinary wounds , of the common poisoned arrows with the juice of garlic : but this is a generail rule for all men that shall hereafter travel the Indies where poisoned arrows are used ,
