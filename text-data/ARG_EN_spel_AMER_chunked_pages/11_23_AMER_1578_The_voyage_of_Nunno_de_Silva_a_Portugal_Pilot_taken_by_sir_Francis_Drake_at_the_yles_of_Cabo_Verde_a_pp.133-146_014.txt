. A prill 13 . Stilo novo . Nuno da Silva set on land . the which were the letters of the king of Spaine , sent to the governor of the Philippinas , as also the sea - cards wherewith they should make their voyage , and direct themselves in their course . And so sailing until the sixt of Aprill , about evening they discovered a ship that held two leagues to seaward from the land : and before the next day in the morning they were hard by her , and suddenly fell upon her while her men slept , and presently made the men enter into their ship , among the which was one DONE Francisco Xarate . Which done , they followed on their course with the said ship , out of the which they took certain packs and other wares , but I know not what it was . They likewise took a Negro out of it , and three days after they both let the ship and men go whither they would , setting therein the two sailors that should go for China , which they had taken in the frigate , keeping only one sailer to show them where they should find fresh water , to the which end they took the empty vessels with them to fill with water , and so kept on their course to the haven of Guatulco , where they put in , being upon Munday the thirteenth of Aprill , and having anchored , they stayed there till the sixe and twentie of Aprill : and about three or foure hours within the night , they set sail , holding their course Westward , and and hour or two before they let Nuno da Silva go , putting him into another ship , that lay in the haven of Guatulco . From thence forward the Englishmen passed on their voyage , to the Islands of Malucos , and from thence they passed by the Cape de Buena Esperanza , and so to England , as it is well known , so that thjs is only the description of the voyage that they made , while the said pilot Nuno da Silva was with them . .
