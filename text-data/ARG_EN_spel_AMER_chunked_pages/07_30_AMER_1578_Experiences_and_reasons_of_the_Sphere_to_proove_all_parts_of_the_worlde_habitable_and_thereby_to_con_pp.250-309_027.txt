be answered in this manner : First , that though the Sun be absent from them those six months , yet it follows not that there should be such extreme darkness ; for as the Sun is departed under their horizon , so is it not far from them : and not so soon as the Sun falls so suddenly comes the dark night ; but the evening does substitute and prolong the day a good while after by twilight . After which time the residue of the night receives light of the Moon and Stars , until the break of the day , which gives also a certain light before the Suns rising ; so that by these means the nights are seidome dark ; which is verified in all parts of the world , but least in the middle Zone under the Equinoctial , where the twilights are short , and the nights darker then in any other place , because the Sun goes under their horizon so deep , even to their antipodes . We see in England in the Summer nights , when the Sun goes not far under the horizon , , that by the light of the Moon & Stars we may travel all night , and if occasion were , do some other labour also . And there is no man that doubteth whither our cattle can see to feed in the nights , seeing we are so well certified thereof by our experience : and by reason of the sphere our nights should be darker then any time under the poles . The Astronomers consent that the Sun descending 274 from our upper hemisphere at the 18 parallel under the horizon makes and end of twilight , so that at length the dark night ensueth , and that afterwards in the morning the Sun approaching again within as many parallels , does drive away the night by access of the twilight . Again , by the position of the sphere under the pole , the horizon , and the equinoctial are all one . These revolutions therefore that are parallel to the equinoctial
