Indians as at any time came unto us , of our speedy return , promising them plenty of knives , beads , and hatchet ' s , if they would reserve their Cassavi , and provide store of their pieces of gold for us : I desired this Captain to be a means that our friends of Trinidad might understand of our being in the River and that we meant to relieve them so soon , as conveniently might be . He promised in Carapana his behalf , that this should not be forgotten . One of the Captains of the Cyawannas , who do now dwell in the River Arawawo , near Trinidad , undertook also without fail to ascertain them thereof . I was the more careful herein , because so many , ships being here , I doubted lest they would take order that no Indian should speak with us . For so indeed it fell out . This Captain of the Cyawannas came likewise to join with us , and had provided fifteene Canoas for that purpose . Their dwelling was lately in Macureo , where the Spaniardes one night stealing on them , killed twentie of their men , and burned their houses , because they refused to trade with them for certain images of gold made with many heads which they had got out of Guiana . I sent a present of Iron to Carapana , and then set sail . In turning down the river we spent eight days . In many places where the channel lies we found twentie fathom depth : where it is shouldst , we had two fathom and a half , and that but in one or two places . Of the worthiness of this River , because I cannot say enough , I will speak nothing . we have presumed to call it by the name of Raleana , because your self was the first of our nation that ever entered the same , and I think it nothing inferior to Amazones , which is best known by the name of Orellana , the first discoverer thereof .
