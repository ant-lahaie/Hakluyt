boiled Cazavi - roots , & dined : after dinner some slept , some washed themselves in the sea , all being stripped to their shirts , & no man keeping watch , no match lighted , not a piece charged . Suddenly as they were thus sleeping & sporting , having got themselves into a corner out of sighed of the ship , there came a multitude of Indians & Portugales upon them , and slew them sleeping : only two escaped , one very soar hurt , the other not touched , by whom we understood of this miserable massacre : with all speed we manned our 4X3 Thirteene men lost at the lie of Placencia by their own extreme negligence . boat , & landed to succour our men ; but we found them slain , & laid naked on a rank one by another , with their faces upward , and a cross set by them : and withal we saw two very great pinnaces come from the river of Jenero very full of men ; whom we mistrusted came from thence to take us : because there came from Jenero soldiers to Santos , when the general had taken the town and was strong in it . Of 76 persons which departed in our ship out of England , we were now left but 27 , having lost 13 in this place , with their chief furniture , as muskets , calivers , powder , & shot . Our cask was all in decay , so that we could not take in more water than was in our ship , for want of cask , and that which we had was marvellous ill conditioned : and being there mored by trees for want of cables and anchors , we still expected the cutting of our morings , to be beaten from our decks with our own furniture , & to be assailed by them of Jenero : what distress we were now driven into , I am not able to express . To depart with 8 tons of water in such bad cask was to starve at sea
