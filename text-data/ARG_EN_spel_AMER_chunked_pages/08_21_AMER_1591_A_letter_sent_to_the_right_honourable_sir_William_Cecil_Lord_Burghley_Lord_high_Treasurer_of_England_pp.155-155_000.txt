A letter sent to the right Honourable Sir William Cecill Lord Burghley , Lord high Treasurer of England etc . From M . Thomas James of Bristoll , concerning the discovery of the Isle of Ramea , dated the 14 of September . 1591 . Right Honourable , my humble duty to your good Lordship done , I thought good humbly to advertise your honour of the discovery of and Island made by two small ships of Saint Malo ; the one 8 days passed being prised near Silley , by a ship of which I am part owner , called the Pleasure , sent by this city to my Lord Thomas Howard , for her Majesties service . Which prize is sent back to this Port by those of the said ships , with upward of fortie tons of Train . The Island lies in 47 . degrees , some fiftie leagues from the grand Bay , near Newfoundland : and is about twentie leagues about , and some part of the Island is flat Sands and should : and the fish comes on bank ( to do their kind ) in April May & June , by numbers of thousands , which fish is very big : and hath two great teeth : and the skin of them is like Buffes leather : and they will not away from their young ones . The young ones are as good meat as Veil . And with the bellies of five of the said fish they make a hogshead of Train , which Train is very sweet , which if it will make soap , the king of Spaine may burn some of his Olive trees . Humbly praying your Lordship to pardon herein my boldness , betaking your Honour to the keeping of the Almighty . From Bristoll , this 14 of September . 1591 . Your Honours most humbly at commandment . Thomas James . .
