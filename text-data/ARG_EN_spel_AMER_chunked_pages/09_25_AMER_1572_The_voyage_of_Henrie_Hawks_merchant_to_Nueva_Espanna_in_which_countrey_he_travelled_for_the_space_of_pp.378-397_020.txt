makes his complaint . This his complaint is immediately herd , & although it be a knight , or a right good gentleman , he is forthwith sent for , and punished both by his goods , and also his person is imprisoned , at the pleasure of the Justice . This is the occasion that the Indians are so tame and civil , as they are : and if they should not have this favour , the Spaniards would soon dispatch all the Indians , or the Indians would kill them . But they may call them dogs , and use other evil words , as much as they will , and the Indian must needs put it up , and go his way . The poor Indians will go every day two or three leagues to a Fair or market with a child upon their necks , with as much fruit or roots , or some kind of ware , as cotton wool , or cadis of all colours , as shall be not past worth a penny : and they will maintain them - 394 i572 - selves upon the same . For they live with a marvelous small matter . They are in such poverty , that if you need to ride into the Country , you shall have and Indian to go with you all the day with your bed upon his back , for one royal of plate : and this you shall have from one town to another . Here you are to understand , that all men that travel by the way , are always wont to carry their beds with them . They are great thieves , and will steal all that they may , and you shall have no recom pence at their hands . The garments of the women , are in this manner . The The apparel uppermost part is made almost like to a woman ' s smock , of the Indians . saving that it is as broad above as beneath , and hath no sleeves , but holes on eke side one to put out their arms .
