the rest which went with him , so that none are escaped but we only . Chap . 5 . The situation and greatness of the City of Cevola , and how friar Marcus took possession thereof and of other provinces , calling the same . The new kingdom of S . Francis , and how after his departure from thence being preserved by God in so dangerous a voyage , he arrived at Compostella in Nueva Galicia . HAving considered the former report of the Indians , and the evil means which I had to prosecute my voyage as I desired , I thought it not good wilfully to lose my life as Stephan did : and so I told them , that God would punish those of Cevola , and that the Viceroy when he should understand what had happened , would send many Christians to chastise them : but they would not believe me , for they said that no man was able to withstand the power of Cevola . And herewithal I left them , and went aside two or three stones cast , and when I returned I found and Indian of mine which I had brought from Mexico called Marcus , who wept and said unto me : Father , these men have consulted to kill us , for they say , that through your and Stephans means their father ' s are slain , and that neither man nor woman of them shall remain unslain . 141 A . D . 1539 - Then again I divided among them certain other things which I had , to appease them , whereupon they were somewhat pacified , albeit they still showed great grief for the people which were slain . I requested some of them to go to Cevola , to see if any other Indian were escaped , with intent that they might learn some news of Stephan ; which I could not obtain at their hands . When I saw this , I said unto them , that I purposed to see the city of Cevola , whatsoever came of it . They said that none of them would go with me .
