, the weakness of our company , the small number of the same , the carrying away of our first appointed bark , with those two especial Master ' s , with our principali provisions in the same , by the very hand of God as it seemed , stretched out to take us from thence ; considering also , that his second offer , though most honourable of his part , yet of ours not to be taken , insomuch as there was no possibility for her with any safety to be brought into the harbour : seeing furthermore , our hope for supply with Sir Richard Greenvill , so undoubtedly promised us before Easter , not yet come , neither then likely to come this year , considering the doings in England for Flanders , and also for America , that therefore I would resolve my self with my company to go into England in that fleet , and accordingly to make request to the general in all our names , that he would be pleased to give us present passage with him . Which request of ours by my self delivered unto him , he most readily assented unto : and so he sending immediately his pinnaces unto our Island for the fetching away of a few that there were left with our baggage , the weather was so boisterous , & the pinnaces so often on ground , that the most of all we had , with all our Cards , Books and writings were by the Sailors cast overboard , the greater number of the fleet being much aggrieved with their long and dangerous abided in that miserable road . ' From whence the general in the name of the Almighty , weighin his anchors ( having bestowed us among his fleet ) for the relief of whom he had in that storm sustained more peril of wrack then in all his former most honourable actions against the Spanyards , with praises unto God for all , set sail the nineteenth of June 1586 , and arrived in Portsmouth the seven and twentieth of July â€™ the same year . .
