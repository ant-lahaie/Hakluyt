And these are as many as the kingdom of Portugal had ever in all their garrisons of the Azores , Madera , Arguin , Cape verde , Guinea , Brasill , Mozambique , Melinde , Zocotora , Ormus , Diu , Goa , Malaca , the Malucos , and Macao upon the coast of China . Yea this I say by the confession of singular expert men of their own nation ( whose names I suppress for certain causes ) which have be personally in the East Indies , & have assured me that their kings The hinge of had never above ten thousand natural born Portugals ( their slaves excepted ) out of their kingdom remaining ten thousand of in all the aforesaid territories . Which also this present their natural year I saw confirmed in a secret extract of the particular subject ' s in all estate of that kingdom and of every government and office subject to the same , with the several pensions there - ^ ons ' unto belonging . Seeing therefore we are so far from want of people , that retiring daily home out of the Low Countries ' they go idle up and down in swarms for lack of honest entertainment , I see no fitter place to employ some part of the better sort of them trained up thus long in service , then in the inward parts of the firm of Virginia against such stubborn Savages as shall refuse obedience to her Majesty . And doubtless many of our men will be glad and feign to accept this condition , when as by the reading of this present treaty they shall understand the fertility and riches of the regions confining so near upon yours , the great commodities and goodness whereof you have been contented to suffer to come to light . In the mean season I humbly commend my self and this my translation unto you , and your self , and all those which under you have taken this enterprise in hand to the grace and good blessing of the Almighty , which is able to built farther , and to finish the good work which in these our days he hath begun by your most Christian and charitable endeavour . From London the 1 . of May 1587 . Your L . humble at commandment . R . Hakluyt . .
