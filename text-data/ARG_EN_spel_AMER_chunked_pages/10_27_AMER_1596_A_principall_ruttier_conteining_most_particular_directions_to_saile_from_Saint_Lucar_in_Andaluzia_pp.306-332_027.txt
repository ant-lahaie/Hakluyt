great parted land as it were sinking with the sea . Note that wheresoever you shall go to seek the Tortugas , and shall come with the coast and find it bear off you Northeast and Southwest , I advice you to go along the coast to the Southwestward : you may not deepen more then fortie five fathoms , for if you do , you shall cast your self without the Tortugas . Also you must note , that if by chance you find your self shot between the Tortugas , and the Martyrs , and that you cannot go on the outside of the said Tortugas , then cause one to go to the top , to see if you can descry them ; and if you cannot see them , stir away Southwest until you see them ; and having got sighed of them , sound , and you shall find eighteene or ninteene fathoms : and so sholding stir away South and by West , and go by this course . And fear you not the sholding , for you shall meet with 12 fathoms , and shall have black sand in your sounding . And going nearer to the end of the said Tortugas ( for he that is on the top shall see them all ) as you pass by , you shall find but eight fathoms , and stony ground , and that is the shouldst water you shall have . And you shall pass by a bustling of a tIED , that shoules out of the channel that way : but you need not fear any thing for you shall have no less then eight fathom water : and being passed the said bustling but a minion shot , you shall lose the ground and be in the channel . 331 Note . WHen you shall pass this course , go not out of sighed of the Tortugas . And if you will go from thence to Havana , having a fair wind , stir away Southwest because the current may not set you off : and if with a fresh wind and Northerly , then stir away Southerly . .
