gifts and friendship . Our Savage made signs in answer from them that our men should be delivered us , and were yet living , and made signs likewise unto us that we should write our letters unto them , for they knew very well the use we have of writing , and received knowledge thereof , either of our poor captive countrymen which they betrayed , or else by this our new captive who hath seen us daily write , and repeat again such words of his language as we desired to learn : but they for this night , because it was late , departed without any letter , although they called earnestly in haste for the same . And the next morning early being the seventh of August , they called again for the letter , which being delivered unto them , they speedily departed , making signs with three fingers , and pointing to the Sun , that they meant to return within 3 days , until which time we herd no more of them , & about the time appointed they returned , in such sort as you shall afterwards hear . This night because the people were very near unto us , the Lieutenant caused the Trumpet to found a call , and every man in the Island repairing to the Ensign , he put them in mind of the place so far from their 308 country wherein they lived , and the danger of a great multitude which they were subject unto , if good watch and ward were not kept , for at every low water the enemy might come almost dryfoot from the main unto us , wherefore he willed every man to prepare him in good readiness upon all sudden occasions , and so giving the watch their charge , the company departed to rest . I thought the Captains letter well worth the remembering , not for the circumstance of curious enditing , but for the substance and good meaning therein contained , and therefore have repeated here the same , as by himself it was hastily written . .
