In my time were 357 dwelling and alive in Mexico , many ancient men that Mexico were of the conquerors at the first conquest with conquered Hernando Cortes : for then it was about 36 . years ^ ” 1520 ^ a § oe ’ at sa ^ Country was conquered . About Mexico there are diverse Mines of silver , and also in other places there about , but the principali Mines that are in all New Spaine are in Sacatecas , 80 . leagues from Mexico , and the Mines of S . Martin , thirtie leagues , both to the Northwestward of Mexico , where is great store of gold and silver . Also there is a place called the Misteca , fiftie leagues to the Northwest , which does yield great store of very good silk , and Cochinilla . Wine and oil there is none growing in the Country , but what comes out of Spaine . Also there are many goodly fruits in that Country , whereof we have none such , as Plantanos , Guyaves , Sapotes , Tunas , and in the wilderness great store of black cherries , and other whol - Cochinilla is some fruits . The Cochinilia is not a worm , or a fly , not a worm as some say ft is > but a berry that grows upon certain beny bushes in the wild field , which is gathered in time of the year , when it is ripe . Also the Indico that doth come from thence to die blue , is a certain herb that grows in the wild fields , and is gathered at one time of the year , and burned , and of the ashes thereof , with Indico . other confections put thereunto , the said Indico is made . Balm , Salsa perilla , Cana fistula , sugar , ox hides , and many other good and serviceable things the Country doth yield , which are yearly brought into Spaine , and there sold and distributed to many nations .
