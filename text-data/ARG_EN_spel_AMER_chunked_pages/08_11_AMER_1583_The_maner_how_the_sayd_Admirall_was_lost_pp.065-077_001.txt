unawares , until master Cox looking out , discerned ( in his judgement ) white cliffs , crying ( land ) withal , though we could not afterwards descry any land , it being very likely the breaking of the sea white , which seemed to be white cliffs , through the haze and thick weather . Immediately tokens were given unto the Delight , to cast about to seaward , which , being the greater ship , and of burden 120 tons , was yet foremost upon the breach , keeping so ill watch , that they knew not the danger , before they felt the same , too late to recover it : for presently the Admiral struck a ground , and had soon after her stern and hinder parts beaten in pieces : whereupon the rest ( that is to say , the Frigate in which was the general and the Golden Hind ) cast about Eastsoutheast , bearing to the South , even for our lives into the winds eye , because that way carried us to the seaward . Making out from this danger , we sounded one while seven fathom , then five fathom , then foure fathom and less , again deeper , immediately foure fathom , then but three fathom , the sea going mightily and high . At last we recovered ( God be thanked ) in some despair , to sea room enough . In this distress , we had vigilant eye unto the Admiral , whom we saw cast away , without power to give the men succour , neither could we espy any of the men that leapt overboard to save themselves , either in the same Pinnace or Cock , or upon rafters , and such like means , presenting themselves to men in those extremities : for we desired to save the men by every possible means . But all in vain , sith God had determined their ruin : yet all that day , and part of the next , we beatrice up and down as near unto the wrack as was possible for us , looking out , if by good hap we might espy any of them . This was a heavy and grievous event
