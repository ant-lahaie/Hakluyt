Equinoctial , yet because the same continued but a small time , ( their days being short , and their nights long ) and the speedy departure of the Sun from their Zenith , because of the sudden crossing of the Zodiac with the Equinoctial , and that by such continual course and recourse of hight and cold , the temperature grew moderate , and very well able to be endured : so now to them under the two Tropickes , the Sun having once by his proper motion declined twentie degrees from the Equinoctial , begins to draw near their Zenith , which may be ( as before ) about the eleventh day of May , and then begins to send his beams almost at right Angles , about which time the Sun entereth into the first degree of Gemini , and with this almost right Angle the Sun beams will continue until it be past Cancer , that is , the space of two months every day at noon , almost perpendicular over their heads , being then the time of Solstitium Aestivale : which so long continuance of the Sun about their Zenith may cause and extreme heat ( if any be in the world ) but of necessity far more heat then can be under the Equinoctial , where the Sun hath not such long abided in the Zenith , but passes away therehence very quickly . Also under the Tropickes , the day is longer by and hour and a half , then it is under the Equinoctial ; wherefore the heat of the Sun having a longer time of operation , must needs be increased , 266 especially seeing the night wherein cold and moisture do abound under the Tropickes , is less then it is under the Equinoctial . Therefore I gather , that under the Tropickes is the hottest place , not only of Torrida Zona , but of any other part of the world , especially because there both causes of heat do concur , that is , the perpendicular falling of the Sun beams two months together , and the longer abided
