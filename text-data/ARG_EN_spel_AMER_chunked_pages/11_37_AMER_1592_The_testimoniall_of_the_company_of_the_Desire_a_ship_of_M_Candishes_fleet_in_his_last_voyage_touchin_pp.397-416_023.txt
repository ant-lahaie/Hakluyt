extreme labour boar out his grief , so that it grew not upon him . To be short , all our men died except 16 , of which there were but 5 able to move . The captain was in good health , the master indifferent , captain Cotton and my self swollen and short winded , yet better then the rest that were sick , and one boy in health : upon us 5 only the labour of the ship did stand . The captain and master , as occasion served , would take in , and heave out the topsails , the master only attended on the spritsail , and all of us at the capsten without sheats and tacks . In fine our misery and weakness was so great , that we could not take in , nor heave out a sail : so our topsail & spritsails were torn all in pieces by the weather . The master and captain taking their turns at the helm , were mightily distressed and monstrously grieved with the most woeful lamenta - They arrive atBear - haven in Ireland the 11 of June Â« 593 - cion of our sick men . Thus as lost wanderers upon the sea , the 11 of June 1593 , it pleased God that we arrived at Bearhaven in Ireland , and there ran the ship on shore : where the Irish men helped us to take in our sails , and to more our ship for Hooting : which slender pains of theirs cost the captain some ten pounds before he could have the ship in safety . Thus without victuals , sails , men , or any furniture God only guided us into Ireland , where the captain left the master and three or foure of the company to keep the ship ; and within 5 days after he and certain others had passage in and English fisherboat to Padstow in Cornewall . In this manner our small remnant by Gods only mercy were preserved , and restored to our country , to whom be all honour and glory world without end . .
