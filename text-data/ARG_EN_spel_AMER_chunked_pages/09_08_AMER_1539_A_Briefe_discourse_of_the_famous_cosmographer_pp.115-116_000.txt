A discourse of the famous Cosmographer John Baptista Ramusius , concerning the three voyages of Friar Marco de Nica , Francis Vasquez de Coronado , and Ferdinando Alorchon next following : taken out of his third volume of Navigations and Voyages . He right honourable DONE Antonio de Mendoga being sent by Charles the Emperor to be viceroy of Mexico and Nueva Espanna , and having understood that DONE Ferdinando Cortez had sent many ships along the coast of Nueva Espanna to discover countries , and to find out the Isles of the Malucos , began himself to desire to do the like , as viceroy of Nueva Espanna ; and hereupon they fell out : for Cortez said that he was general and discoverer of the South sea , and that it belonged to him to set forth those voyages . On ‚Äù 5 the other side , the lord DONE Antonio alleged that it belonged to him to make that discovery , as being viceroy of Nueva Espanna . So that they fell at great variance , and Cortez returned into Spaine to complain unto the Emperor . DONE Antonio in the mean season having obtained knowledge of the voyage , which Andrew Dorantez ( who was one of the company of Pamphilo Narvaez that escaped , as you may read in the relation of Alvaro Nunnez , called Cabe ^ a de Vaca ) made ; sent Frier Marco de Ni ? a with a Negro of the said Dorantez to discover that country . Which Friar Marco de Ni ? a being returned , & having informed his lordship of all his discovery , he sent captain Francis Vasquez de Coronado with many Spaniards on horseback and Indians on foot : likewise he sent a fleet by sea , whereof Ferdinando Alorchon was captain , as may be seen in the relations following . .
