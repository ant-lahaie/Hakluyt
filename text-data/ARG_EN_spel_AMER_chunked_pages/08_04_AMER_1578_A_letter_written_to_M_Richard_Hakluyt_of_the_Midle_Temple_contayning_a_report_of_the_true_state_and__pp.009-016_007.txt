of both sorts . And thus I end , assuring you on my faith , that if I had not been deceived by the vile Portugals descending of the Jewes and Judas kind , I had not failed to have searched this river , and all the coast of Cape Briton , what might have be found to have benefited our country : but they breaking their bans , and falsifying their faith and promise , disappointed me of the salt they should have brought me in part of recompense of my good service in defending them two years against French Rovers , that had spoiled them , if I had not defended them . By means whereof they made me loose not only the searching of the country , but also forced me to come home with great loss above 600 . li . For recompense whereof I have sent my man into Portugall to demand justice at the Kings hand , if not , I must put up my supplication to the Queens Majesty & her honourable council , to grant me leave to stay here so much of their goods as they have damnified me , or else that I may take of them in Newfound land , as much fish as shall be worth 600 . li . or as much as the salt might have made . I pray you advertise me what way I were best to take , and what hope there will be of a recompense if I follow the suit : many there are that do comfort me , and do bid me proceed , for that her Majesty and the council do tender poor fisher men , who with me have sustained three hundred pound loss in that voyage . And to conclude , if you and your friend shall think me a man sufficient and of credit , to seek the Isle of S . John , or the river of Canada , with any part of the firm land of Cape Briton , I shall give my diligence for the true and perfect discovery , and leave some part of mine own business to further the same : and thus I end , committing you to God . From Bristow the 13 . of November , 1578 . Yours to use and command Anthony Parckhurst . .
