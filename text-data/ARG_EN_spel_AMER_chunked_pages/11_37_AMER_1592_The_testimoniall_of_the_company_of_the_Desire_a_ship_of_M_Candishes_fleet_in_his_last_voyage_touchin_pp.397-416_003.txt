So we parted our poor store , and she laboured to fetch us seals to eat , wherewith we lived when smeltes and muscles failed : for in the nepe streams we could get no muscles . Thus in most miserable calamity we remained until the sixt of August , still keeping watch upon the hills to look for our general , and so great was our vexation and anguish of soul , as I think never flesh and blood endured more .
