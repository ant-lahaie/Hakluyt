should have be our guide : notwithstanding this Lord would not give over the enterprise , but instead of the fisherman took certain mariners that returned out of the Island with him : and so making our Navigation to the Westwards , we discovered certain Islands subject to Frisland , and having passed certain shelves we stayed at Ledovo for the space of 7 days to refresh our selves , and to furnish the fleet with necessary provision . Departing from thence we arrived the first of July at the Isle of llofe : and for that the wind made for us , we stayed not there , but passed 458 forth , and being upon the main sea , there arose immediately a cruel tempest , wherewith for eight days space we were miserably vexed , not knowing where we were : & a great part of the barks were cast away , afterwards the weather waxing fair , we gathered up the broken pieces of the barks that were lost , and sailing with a prosperous wind we discovered land at West . Wherefore keeping our course directly upon it , we arrived in a good and safe harbour , where we saw and infinite company of people ready in arms , come running very furiously to the water side , as it were for defence of the Island . Wherefore Zichmni causing his men to make signs of peace unto them , they sent io men unto us that could speak ten languages , but we could understand none of them , except one that was of Island . He being brought before our prince and asked , what was the name of the Island , and what people inhabited it , & who governed it , answered , that the Island was called Icaria , and that all the kings that reigned there , were called Icari , after the name of the first king of that place , which as they say was the son of Dedalus king of Scotland , who conquered that Island , left his son there for king , and left them those laws that they retain
