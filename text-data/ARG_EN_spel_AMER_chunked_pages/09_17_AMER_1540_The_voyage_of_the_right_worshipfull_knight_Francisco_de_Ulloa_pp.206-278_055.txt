to return under the shelter of that Hand which we left behind us , from whence we had sailed above 254 twentie leagues . And that Friday at night somewhat Twentie late we had sailed back above twelve leagues of the same , and because it was night we stayed in the sea , ofQedars . where we and our ships were not a little troubled , so that all that night none of us slept a wink , but watched every one . The next morning betimes being Saturday we proceeded on our voyage , and gate under the shelter of the said Hand , riding in thirtie fathom water : and on that side where we ankored , we found high and closed mountains , with heaps of a certain earth which was all ashes and burned , and in other places scorched and as black as coals , and like the rust of iron , and in other places whitish , and here and there small black hills , whereat we marveled exceedingly , considering that when we passed by , it seemed unto us and habitable country full of trees , and now we saw not a stick growing on this side . All of us supposed that on the other side towards the firm land the trees grew which we saw , although ( as I have said ) we sailed foure or five leagues distant from the same . We stayed here under the shelter of these mountains Saturday , Sunday , and Munday , always having the Northern wind so strong , that we think if it had caught us in the sea , we should have be cast away .
