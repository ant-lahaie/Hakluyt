and departed from the shore towards our Ships , with as much speed as we could : For the weather began to overcast , and very likely that a foul and stormy night would ensue . Therefore the same Evening with much danger and labour , we god our selves aboard , by which time the wind and seas were so greatly risen , that we doubted our Cables and Anchors would scarcely hold until Morning : wherefore the Captain caused the Boat to be manned with five lusty men , who could swim all well , and sent them to the little Hand on the right hand of the Harbour , to bring aboard sixe of our men , who had filled our cask with fresh water : the Boat the same night returned aboard with our men , but all our Cask ready filled they left behind , unpossible to be had aboard without danger of casting away both men and Boats : for this night proved very stormy and foul . The next Morning it was agreed by the Captain and my self , with the Master and others , to weigh anchor , and go for the place at Croatoan , where our planters were : for that then the wind was good for that place , and also to leave that Cask with fresh water on shore in the Hand until our return . So then 418 they brought the cable to the Capston , but when the anchor was almost apecke , the Cable broke , by means whereof we lost another Anchor , wherewith we drove so fast into the shore , that we were forced to let fallen a third Anchor : which came so fast home that the Ship was almost aground by Kenricks mounts : so that we were forced to let slip the Cable end for end . And if it had not chanced that we had fallen into a channel of deeper water , closer by the shore then we accounted of , we could never have gone clear of the point that lies to the Southwards of Kenricks mounts .
