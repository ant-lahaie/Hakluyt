Howbeit the Minion which had made her sails ready , shifted for her self , without consent of the general , Captain or Master , so that very hardly our general could be received into the Minion : the most of our men that were in the Jesus shifted for themselves , and followed the Minion in the boat , and those which that small boat was not able to receive , were most cruelly slain by the Spaniards . Of our ships none escaped saving the Minion and the Judith : and all such of our men as were not in them were enforced to abide the tyrannous cruelty of the Spaniards . For it is a certain truth , that whereas they had taken certain of our men ashore , they took and hung them up by the arms upon high posts until the blood burst out of their fingers ends : of which men so used , there is one Copstow , and certain others yet alive , who by the merciful providence of the almighty , were long since Copstoweoneof M .
