This day we stroke a rock seeking for and harbour , and received a leak : and this day we were in 54 degrees of latitude . The 14 we stopped our leak in a storm not very outrageous , at noon . The 15 being almost in 52 degrees of latitude , and not finding our ships , nor ( according to their promise ) any kind of mark , token , or beacon , which we willed them to set up , and they protested to do so upon every head land , Island or cape , within twenty leagues every way off The fishing from their fishing place , which our captain appointed to place between between 54 and 55 degrees : This 15 I say we shaped ^ ■ ees of lati - our course homeward for England , having in our ship tude . but little wood , and half a hogshead of fresh water .
