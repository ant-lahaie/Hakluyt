, which bore a head : so that there kept no more with the Admiral , but the Defiance , the Adventure , and the Phoenix . The 28 we were in 39 degrees , and stood away for Flores , which the 8 of Aprill we saw , and the 9 came to and anchor on the Southside , where we watered because the Defiance when we came in had but two buts of water . We bartered with the Portugals for some fresh victuals , and set here on shore at our coming away out of the Admiral our two Portugall Pilots ; which sir Francis Drake carried out of England with him . The 10 being Easter - eve at night we set sail the wind serving us to lie some slent in our course . That night and Easter day we had much rain : the wind came up at Northeast , we beat it up some 30 leagues to the Eastward , & then about to the West , and so again to the East , and tried , and the next board to the West . On Thursday towards night , being the 16 we had sighed of Corvo again , we tried all that night : and on Friday towards night we came to and anchor to the Westward of the point of Santa Cruz under Flores : but before midnight we drave , and set sail the next day standing away Northeast . About three of the clock in the afternoon the wind came up again at North . On sunday the 19 by two of the clock in the afternoon we had made 20 leagues and East way : and then the wind came up a good gale at Northwest , and so Northeast with a flown sheet we made the best way we could : but being dispersed by bad weather we arrived about the beginning of May in the West parts of England . And the last ships which came in together to Plimmouth were the Defiance , the Garland , the Adventure , and the Phoenix . .
