Certain Spanish Letters intercepted by ships of the worshipful Master John Wattes written from diverse places of the islands and of the main land as well of Nueva Espanna , as of Tierra Firma and Peru , containing many secrets touching the aforesaid countries ' , and the state of the South Sea , and the trade to the Philippinas . A letter sent from Havana in Cuba from the general of the fleet John de Orimo to the king of Spaine the 18 of October 1590 , touching the building of certain excellent Frigates , etc . TO may please your majesty that at the date hereof one of the Frigates was launched : and three more will be ready against the fleet depart from hence . They are very big and excellent of sail , which will carry 150 men a piece with soldiers and mariners . And having good ordinance , there are few or none of our enemies that can ofiend us . For we shall both leave and take at all times when we list . But it behooveth your majesty to send both soldiers and mariners to man the Frigates . For we have great want of soldiers and mariners , with tackling , anchors , powder , shot , calivers , and all kind of furniture for them . For these things are not here to be had for money : and likewise to send some great ordinance for the Zabras . For the merchant ' s ships are so weak and so unprovided , that they have almost none to defend themselves . Also we shall be constrained to give the carena again unto all the ships ; for they are very weak by reason of the long voyage : and the mariners and soldiers are weary with their long traveling and keeping of them here . Thus if it would please your majesty to 158 command with all expedition that these soldiers and mariners with all kind of other furniture might be sent us , then the fleet may set forward and so proceed on their voyage . God preserve your Catholic royal
