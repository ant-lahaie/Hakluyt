and our boat on shore for fresh water , because we stood in need of it , which did so with eighteene good men , and three or foure tun of water cask . They were from us till the eighth day in the morning , at which time we espied them again , and that day we came all together into the road of Camana , where there came a Canoa aboard us , and one of the chiefest Portugals that belonged to the place . Here we took in beefs , hogs , water and wood at our pleasure , having almost no man able to resist us , but some of our Portugals stole from us in the Canoa . The 11 day we entered into the haven of Baya , where we were received at the point coming in , with two great pieces of Ordinance , which discharged bullets at us five times a piece , but they lost shot and powder , and did us not harm . After we had passed the point , we hailed in for the road as close as the wind would permit us , but could not come so near as we desired , and therefore we came to and anchor a fair birth off the town , not without great store of shot from thence , but yet our harm was none at all for ought they could do . At our coming in , we found in the road eight ships and one caravel , of the which one was a hulk or double fly boat of the burden of two hundred and fifty tons , having in her 24 pieces of good Ordinance : she with the 215 A . D . 1587 . March . The road of Camana . They come into the river of Baya . They take 4 ships out of the harbour of Baya , notwithstanding the shot of the enemy . A hulk of Flushing . rest of the ships , together with the town , gave us shot , and shot , but not one touched so much as any of our sails .
