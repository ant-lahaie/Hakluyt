which pieces of silver were in form like unto the boss of a bridle . These Savages were far more civil than those of Dominica : for beside their courtesy , they covered their privities with a plaited mat of green straw , about three handfuls deep , which came round about their waste , with the bush hanging down behind . The next day in the morning very early , there came a frigate of the island of Cuba of 30 tons , put in by weather , which was bound for Havana , wherein were fifty hogs ; to which we gave chase all that day , passing the gulf of Bahama , and about five of the clock in the afternoon , after a shot or two made at her , she yielded unto us : we hoist out our boat , and went aboard , where we found some five Spanyards , five and fifty hogs , and about some two hundred weight of excellent tobacco rolled up in seynes . We lightened them of their hogs and tobacco , and sent the men away with their frigate . In this voyage we took and sacked foure towns , 189 seventeene frigates , and two ships , whereof eight were taken in the bay of the Honduras ; of all which we brought but two into England : the rest we sunk , burned , and one of them we sent away with their men . And to make up the full number of twenty , the Spanyards themselves set one on fire in the bay of the Honduras , lest we should be master ' s of it . We shaped our course from Florida homeward by the isle of Flores one of the Azores , where we watered , finding sir John Burgh there , who took us to be Spanyards , and made up unto us ; with whom we joined in the taking the mighty Portugall carrack called Madre de Dios , and our captain M . Christopher Newport with diverse of us was placed in her as captain by the general sir John Burgh to conduct her into England , where we arrived in Dartmouth the seventh of September 1592 . .
