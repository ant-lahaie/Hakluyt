Terra de Labrador , etc . and upon these coasts ( as aforesaid ) they have never be found . So that by all likelihood they could never have come without shipwreck upon the coasts of Germanie , if they had first stricken upon the coasts of so many countries , wanting both Art and shipping to make orderly discovery , and altogether ignorant both in the Art of Navigation , and also of the Rocks , Flats , Sands or Havens of those parts of the world , which in most of these places are plentiful ! . 6 And further it seems very likely , that the inhabitants of the most part of those countries , by which they must have come any other way beside by the Northwest , being for the most part Anthropophagi , or men eaters , would have devoured them , slain them , or ( at the least wise ) kept them as wonders for the gaze . So that it plainly appears that those Indians ( which as you have herd in sundry ages were driven by tempest upon the shore of Germanie ) came only through our Northwest passage . 7 Moreover , the passage is certainly proved by a Navigation that a Portugall made , who passed through this fret , giving name to a Promontory far within the same , calling it after his own name , Promontorium Corterialis , near adjoining unto Polisacus fluvius . 8 Also one Scolmus a Dane entered and passed a great part thereof . 9 Also there was one Salvaterra , a Gentleman of Victoria in Spaine , that came by chance out of the West Indias into Ireland , Anno 1568 . who affirmed thee Northwest passage from us to Cataia , constantly to be believed in America navigable . And further said in the presence of sir Henry Sidney ( then lord Deputie of Ireland ) in my hearing , that a Friar of Mexico , called Andrew Urdaneta , more then eight years before 179 his then coming into Ireland , told him there , that he came from Mar deal Sur
