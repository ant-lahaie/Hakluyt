The 29 of this same month we departed with all our ships from Sierra Leona , towards the West Indies , and for the space of eighteene days , we were becalmed , having now and then contrary winds , and 24 some Ternados , among the same calm , which happened to us very ill , being but reasonably watered , for so great a company of Negroes , and our selves , which pinched us all , and that which was worst , put us in such fear that many never thought to have reached to the Indies , without great death of Negroes , and of themselves : but the Almighty God , who never suffers his elect to perish , sent us the sixteenth of Februarie , the ordinary Brise , which is the Northwest wind , which never left us , till we came to and Island of the Canybals , called Dominica , where we arrived Dominica the ninth of March , upon a Saturday : and because it was the most desolate place in all the Island , we could see no Canybals , but some of their houses where they dwelled , and as it should seem forsook the place for want of fresh water , for we could find none there but rain water , and such as fell from the hills , and remained as a puddle in the dale , whereof we filled for our Negroes . The Canybals of that Island , and also others adjacent are the most desperate warriors that are in the Indies , by the Spaniardes Canybals exreport , who are never able to conquer them , and they are molested by them not a little , when they are driven that to water there in any of those Islands : of very late , not two months past , in the said Island , a Caravel being driven to water , was in the night set upon by the inhabitants , who cut their cable in the halser , whereby they were driven a shore , and so taken by them , and eaten .
