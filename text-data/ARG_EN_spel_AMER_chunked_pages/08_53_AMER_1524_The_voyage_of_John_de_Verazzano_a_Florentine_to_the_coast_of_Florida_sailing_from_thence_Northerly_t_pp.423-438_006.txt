They saw only one old woman with a young maid of 18 . or 20 . years old , which seeing our company , hid themselves in the grass for fear : the old woman carried two Infants on her shoulders , and behind her neck a child of 8 . years old . The young woman was laden 428 likewise with as many : but when our men came unto them , the women cried out : the old woman made signs that the men were fled unto the woods .
