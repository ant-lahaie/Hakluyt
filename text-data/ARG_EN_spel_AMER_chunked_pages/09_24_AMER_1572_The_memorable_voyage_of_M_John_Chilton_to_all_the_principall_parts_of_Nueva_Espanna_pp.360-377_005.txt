, Wax , and fine platters gilded , made of earth , and much gold . The next Summer following , being in the year 1570 ( which was the first year that the Popes Buis were brought into the Indies ) I undertook another voyage towards the province of Sonsonate , which is in the kingdom of Guatimala , whither I carried diverse merchandise of Spaine , all by land on mules backs . The way thitherward from Mexico is to the city of the Angels , and from thence to another city of Christians 80 leagues off , called Guaxaca , in which there dwelled about counterfeit 3 ^ 4 Spanyards , and many Indians . All the Indians of this province pay their tribute in mantles of Cotton wool , and Cochinilia , whereof there grows abundance throughout this country . Near to this place there lies a port in the South sea , called Aguatulco , in the which there Agwtuko . dwell not above three or foure Spanyards , with certain Negroes , which the king maintaineth there : in which place Sir Francis Drake arrived in the year 1579 , in the month of April , where I lost with his being there above a thousand ducats , which he took away , with much other goods of other merchant ' s of Mexico from one Francisco Gomes Rangifa , factor there for all the Spanish merchant ' s that then traded in the South sea : for from this port they use to embark all their goods that go for Peru , and to the kingdom of Honduras . From Guaxaca I came to a town nam Nixapa , which stands Nixapa . upon certain very high hills in the province of Sapot - Sapotecas . ecas , wherein inhabit about the number of twenty Spanyards , by the King of Spaines commandment , to keep that country in peace : for the Indians are very rebellious : and for this purpose he bestoweth on them the towns & cities that be within that province . From hence I went to a city called Tecoantepec
