. So that this Northeastern currant must at the length abruptly bow towards us South on the West side of Finmarke and Norway : or else strike down Southwest above Groan - land , or betwixt Groneland and Iseland , into the Northwest straight we speak of , as of congruence it doth , if you mark the situation of that Region , and by the report of M . Frobisher experience teaches us . And M . Frobisher the further he travailed in the former passage , as he told me , the deeper always he found the Sea . Lay you now the sum hereof together . The rivers run where the channels are most hollow , the sea in taking his course waxes deeper , the Sea waters fallen continually from the North Southward , the Northeastern current striketh down into the straight we speak of , and is there augmented with whole mountains of ice and snow falling down furiously out from the land under the North pole . Where store of water is , there is it a thing impossible to want Sea , where Sea not only doth not want , but waxes deeper , there can be discovered no land . Finally , whence I pray you came the contrary tide , that M . Frobisher met withal after that he had sailed no small way in that passage , if there be any Isthmos or straight of land betwixt the aforesaid Northwestern gulf , and Mar deal Zur , to join Asia and America together ? That conclusion frequented in schools Quicquid praeter , etc . was meant of the parts of the world then known , and so is it of right to be understood . 200 The fift objection requires for answer wisdom and Sol . 5 . policy in the traveler , to win the Barbarians favour by some good means : and so to arm and strengthen himself , that when he shall have the repulse in one coast , he may safely travail to and other , commodiously taking his convenient times , and discreetly making choice of them
