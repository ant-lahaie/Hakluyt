his mercy would help us with a prosperous wind to proceed on our voyage . On Shrovesunday at night , to make good cheer withal we had so great wind and rain , that there was nothing in our ships which was not wet , and a very cold air . On Ashwednesday at sunrising we struck sail near a point which we fell somewhat short withal in a great bay running into this firm land : and this is the place where we saw five or sixe fires , and at the rising of the sun being so near the shore that we might well descry and view it at our pleasure we saw it to be very pleasant , for we descried as far as we could discern with our eyes , fair valleys and small hills , with green shrubs very pleasant to 268 behold , although there grew no trees there .

After noontide we had contrary wind , which still was our enemy in all our journey , at the least from the point of the port of Santa Cruz . Here we were constrained to anchor in five fathom water , and after we road at anchor we began to view the country , and took delight in beholding how goodly and pleasant it was , and near unto the sea we judged that we saw a valley of white ground . At evening so great a tempest came upon us of wind and rain , that it was so fearful and dangerous a thing that a greater cannot be expressed ; for it had like to have driven us upon the shore , and the chief Pilot cast out another great anchor into the sea , yet all would not serve ,
