in the morning at Eastnortheast , which be for the prevent of their cruelty , and the save of our 181 a fight from 7 . in the morning till 11 . at night . live . also ( the lord be praise for it ) in all this dangerous fight , we have not one man slay , and . but 2 . hurt : but our sail and rope be so rend with their shot , that it be wonderful to behold : our main mast also be shoot clean through , whereby we be in exceed great danger . thus our consort forsake we , and leave we in these extremity . the next day be the 14 . of June in the morning , we see all our adversary to leeward of we , and they espy we , chase we till 10 . of the clock , and then see they can not prevail , give we over . so that day about 5 . of the clock in the afternoon , we bear up to the southwest , in hope to find our consort , but we have no sight of they at that time , nor afterward . then stand we in all that night for the cape of S . Anthony , hope there to see our admiral accord to his direction . the 15 . day of June early in the morning , we descry the spanish fleet again , be within 5 . league of cape S . Anthony . than ( have no sight of our consort ) we stand for the place accord to the direction of our owner sir George Carey , where we do ply for the space of 23 . day , and never can see any sail but two frigate , which we give chase unto the 24 . of June , and can not fetch they up . thus we give God most humble thanks for our safe deliverance from the cruel enemy , which have be more mighty by the providence of God , than any tongue can express : to who be all praise , honour , and glory , both now and ever , amen .
