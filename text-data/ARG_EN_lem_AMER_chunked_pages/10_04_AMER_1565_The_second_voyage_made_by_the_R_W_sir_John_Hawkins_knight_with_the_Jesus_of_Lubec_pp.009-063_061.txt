and follow her prey very fierce , not only in the water , but also out of the water : for as the fly fish take her flight , so do this bonito leap after they , and take they sometime above the water . there be some of those bonito , which be gall by a fisgig , do follow our ship come out of Guinea 500 league . there be a sea - foul also that chase this fly fish aswell as the bonito : for as the fly fish take her flight , so do this foul pursue to take she , which to behold be a great pleasure than hawk , for both the flight be as pleasant , and also more often than a hundred time : for the fowl can fly no way , but one or other light in her paw , the number of they be so abundant . there be a innumerable young fry of these fly fish , which common keep about the ship , and be not so big as butterfly , and yet by fly do avoid the unsatiableness of the bonito . of the big sort of these fish we take many , which both night and day fly into the sail of our ship , and there be not one of they which be not worth a bonito : for be put upon a hook drable in the water , the bonito will leap thereat , and so be take . also , we take many with a white cloth make fast to a hook , which be tie so short in the water , that it may leap out and in , the greedy bonito think it to be a fly fish leap thereat , and so be deceive . we take also dolphin dolphin . which be of very goodly colour and proportion to behold , and no less delicate in taste . fowl also there be many , both upon land and upon sea : but concern they on the land i be not able to name they , because my abode be there so short .
