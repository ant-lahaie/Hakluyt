Elmo to cease the torment , and save they from the peril that they be in , with promise he that at their come on land , they will repair unto his chapel , and there cause mass to be say , and other ceremony to be do . the friar cast relic into the sea , to cause the sea to be still , and likewise say gospel , with other cross and ceremony upon the sea to make the storm to cease : which ( as they say ) do much good to weaken the fury of the storm . but i can not perceive it , nor give no credit
