the basis a line extend from saint Thomas hand under the equinoctial , unto Paris in France near the same meridian : therefore the two angle of the base must needs be equal per 5 . primi , ergo the force of the heat equal , if there be no other cause then the reason of the angle , as the old philosopher have appoint . but in June be because at Paris the sun rise two hour before it m ^ then0 * r ^ set ^ to under the equinoctial , and set like - und the wise two hour after they , by mean of the obliquity equinoctial , of the horizon , in which time of the sun presence four hour in one place more than the other , it work some effect more in one place then in the other , and be of equal height at noon , it must then needs follow to be more hot in the parallel of Paris , than it be under the equinoctial . 258 also this be a other reason , that when the sun set to they under the equinoctial , it go very deep and low under their horizon , almost even to their antipode , whereby their twilight be very short , twilight and their night be make very extreme dark and long , a ’ sl ® rter . ’ and so the moisture and coldness of the long night dark under wonderful increase , so that at length the sun the equinoc - rising can hardly in many hour consume and drive at away the cold humour and moist vapour of the night Paris ' past , which be clean contrary in the parallel of Paris : for the sun go under their horizon but very little , after a slope sort , whereby their night be not very dark , but lightsome , as look into the north in a clear night without cloud it do manifest appear , their twilight be long : for the parallel of Cancer cut not the horizon of Paris at right angle , but at
