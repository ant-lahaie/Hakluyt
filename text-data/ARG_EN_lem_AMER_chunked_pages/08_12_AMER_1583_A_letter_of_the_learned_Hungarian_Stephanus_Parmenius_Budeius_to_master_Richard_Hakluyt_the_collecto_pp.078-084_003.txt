great heap , and mountain of ice , in the midst of the sea have teach we : some of our company report , that in may , they be sometime keep in , with such huge ice , for 16 . whole day together , as that the island thereof be threescore fathom thick , the side whereof which be towards the sun , when they be melt , the whole mass or heap be so invert and turn in manner of balance , that that part which be before downward rise upward , to the great peril of those that be near they , as by reason we may gather . the air upon land be indifferent clear , but at sea towards the east there be nothing else but perpetuali mist , and in the sea it self , about the bank ( for so they call the place where they find ground forty league distant from the shore , and where they begin to fish ) there be no day without rain . when we have serve , and supply our necessity in this place , we purpose by the help of God to pass towards the south , with so much the more hope every day , by how much the great the thing be , that be report of those country , which we go to discover . thus much touch our estate . now i desire to know somewhat concern you , but i fear in vain , but special i desire out of measure to know how my patron master Henry Umpton do take my absence : my obedience , and duty shall always be ready towards he as long as i live : but in deed i hope , that this journey of we shall | be profitable to his intention . it remain that you think i to be still you , and so you as no man moor . the son of God bless all our labor , so far , as that you your self may be partaker of our blessing . adieu , my most friendly , most sweet , most virtuous Hakluyt : in newfound land , at saint Johns port , the 6 . of August . 1583 .
