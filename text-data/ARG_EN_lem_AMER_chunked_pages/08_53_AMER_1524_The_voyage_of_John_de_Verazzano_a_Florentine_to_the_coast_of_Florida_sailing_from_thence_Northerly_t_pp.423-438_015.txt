for the space of fifty league . and trending afterward to the north , we find another land high full of thick wood , the tree whereof be firre , cipress and such like as be wont to grow in cold country . the people differ much from the other , and look how much the former seem to be courteous and gentle : so much be these full of rudeness and ill manner , and so barbarous that by no sign that ever we can make , we can have any kind of traffic with they . they cloth themselves with bear skin and luzerne and seal and other beast skin . their food , as far as we can perceive , repair often unto their dwelling , we suppose to be by hunt and fish , and of certain fruit , which be a kind of root which the earth yield of her own accord . they have no grain , neither saw we any kind or sign of tillage , neither be the land , for the barrenness thereof , apt to bear fruit or seed . if at any time we desire by exchange to have any of their commodity , they use to come to the sea shore upon certain craggy rock , and we stand in our boat , they let down with a rope what it please they to give we , cry continual that we shall not approach to the land , demand immediate the exchange , take nothing but knife , fishooke , and tool to cut withal , neither do they make any account of our courtesy . and when we have nothing leave to exchange with they , when we depart from they , the people show all sign of discourtesy and disdain , as be possible for any creature to invent . we be in despite of they 2 or 3 league within the land , be in number 25 arm man of we : and when we go on shore they shoot at we with their bow make great outcry , and afterward flee into the wood . we find not in this land any thing notable , or of importance , save very great wood
