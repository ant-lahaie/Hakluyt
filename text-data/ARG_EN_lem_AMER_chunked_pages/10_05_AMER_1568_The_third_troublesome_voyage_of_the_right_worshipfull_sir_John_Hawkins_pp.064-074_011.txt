And be arrive the last day of December in a place near unto Vigo call Ponte Vedra , our man with excess of fresh meat grow into miserable disease , and die a great part of they . this matter be bear out as long as it may be , but in the end although there be none of our man suffer to go a land , yet by access of the Spaniard , our feebleness be know to they . whereupon they cease not to seek by all mean to betray we , but with all speed possible we depart to Vigo , where we have some help of certain english ship and twelve fresh man , wherewith we repair our want as we may , and depart the 20 day of January 1568 arrive in mount bay in Cornwall the 25 of the same month , praise be God therefore . if all the misery and troublesome affair of this sorrowful voyage shall be perfect and thorough write , there shall need a painful man with his pen , and as great a time as he have that write the life and death of the martyr .
