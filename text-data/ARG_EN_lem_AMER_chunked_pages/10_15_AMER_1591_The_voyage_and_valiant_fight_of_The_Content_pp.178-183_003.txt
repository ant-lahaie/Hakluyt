we so gall they with our musket , that we put they from our quarter . than they wind their galley , come up into our stern , and with the way that the galley have , do so violent thrust in the board of our captain cabin , that her nose come into it , mind to give we all their prow , and so to sink we . but we be resolute , so ply they with our small shot , that they can have no time to discharge their great ordinance : and when they begin to approach , we heave into they a ball of fire , and by that mean put they off : whereupon they once again fall astern of we , and give we a prow . then have the second time put they off , we go to prayer , and sing the first part of the 25 . psalm , praise God for our safe deliverance . This be do , we may see 2 . galley and a frigate all three of they bend themselves together to encounter we : hereupon we ( eftsoon commend our estate into the hand of God ) arm our self , and resolve ( for the honour of God , her majesty , and our country ) to fight it out till the last man . then shake a pike of fire in defiance of the enemy , and weave they amain , we bid they come aboard : and a Englishman in the galley make answer , that they will come aboard present . So manage ourselves to our furniture , and every moment expect the assault , we hear they parley to this effect , that they determine to keep we company till the morning , and then to make a end with we : then give we another shot from one of the galley , they fall astern . thus our fight continue with the ship and with the galley , from seven of the clock in the morning till eleven at night . howbeit God ( which never fail they that put their trust in he ) send we a gale of wind about two of the clock
