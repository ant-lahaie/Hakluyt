land as it be sink with the sea . note that wheresoever you shall go to seek the Tortugas , and shall come with the coast and find it bear off you north - east and Southwest , i advise you to go along the coast to the southwestward : you may not deepen more than forty five fathom , for if you do , you shall cast your self without the Tortugas . also you must note , that if by chance you find your self shoot between the Tortugas , and the martyr , and that you can go on the outside of the say Tortugas , then cause one to go to the top , to see if you can descry they ; and if you can see they , stir away southwest until you see they ; and have get sight of they , sound , and you shall find eighteen or nineteen fathom : and so shold stir away south and by west , and go by this course . and fear you not the shold , for you shall meet with 12 fathom , and shall have black sand in your sound . And go near to the end of the say Tortugas ( for he that be on the top shall see they all ) as you pass by , you shall find but eight fathom , and stony ground , and that be the shall water you shall have . and you shall pass by a bustle of a tide , that shoules out of the chanel that way : but you need not fear any thing for you shall have no less than eight fathom water : and be past the say bustle but a minion shoot , you shall loose the ground and be in the channel . 331 note . when you shall pass this course , go not out of sight of the Tortugas . and if you will go from thence to Havana , have a fair wind , stir away Southwest because the current may not set you off : and if with a fresh wind and northerly , then stir away southerly . .
