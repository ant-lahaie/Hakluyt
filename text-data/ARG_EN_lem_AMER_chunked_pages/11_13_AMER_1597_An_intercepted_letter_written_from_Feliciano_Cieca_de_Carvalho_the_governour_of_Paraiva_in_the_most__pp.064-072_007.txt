and destroy in the last war , and likewise the town of thetowne of S . Augustine , and that you shall build they again at and au & ustine - your own proper cost and charge : for the friar allege that these town be give they , by a decree send they from pope pius quintus , that the say friar shall govern and rule they . on the other side i have pronounce another sentence against the say friar , in your majesty name , and for your majesty , allege that those town , village , and subject appertain and belong unto your majesty , and that in temporali cause i be to punish those offender , which shall rebel against your majesty : and as touch ecclesiastical cause that the vicar of this cathedral church shall rule , govern and instruct they in the christian religion . so we both have appeal unto your majesty herein , and your majesty may peruse all our write , and then determine that which shall be best and most profitable for your majesty service and enlargement of your crown . for through these broil the inhabitant of this Parajua forsake their house and dwell place , and so do some of the friar , because they can be suffer to rule and govern . also the Indians have complain against i , because i have burn their village in this last rebellion . wherefore if your majesty do not send some order for this country and see into these case , it will breed great dissension and rebellion among we , and we shall be ready to cut one another throat before it be long . thus i think good , accord to my humble bind duty , and for the service of your majesty and quietness of this realm , to certify your majesty the truth of the whole matter ; hope in short time that your majesty will send some good order to qualify these broil : for there be great hatred and malice among we . Jesus Christ preserve and keep the royal person of your majesty with long health , as it please he . from the captainship of Parajua this present 20 of August . 1597 . Feliciano Cieza de Carvalsho . .
