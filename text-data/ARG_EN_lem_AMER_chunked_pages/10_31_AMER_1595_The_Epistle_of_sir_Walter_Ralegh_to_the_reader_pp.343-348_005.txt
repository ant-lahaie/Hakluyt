defend it self may be compare to a body dangerous disease , which for a season may be preserve with vulgar medicine , but in a short time , and by little and little , the same must needs fall to the ground , and be dissolve . i have therefore labour all my life , both accord to my small power , and persuasion , to advance all those attempt , that may either promise return of profit to our self , or at least be a let and impeachment to the quiet course and plentiful trade 347 of the spanish nation , who in my weak judgement by such a war be as easy endanger and bring from his powerfulness , as any prince of Europe , if it be consider from how many kingdom and nation his revenue be gather , and those so weak in their own being , and so far sever from mutual succour . but because such a preparation and resolution be not to be hope for in haste , and that the time which our enemy embrace , can be have again to advantage , i will hope that these province , and that empire now by i discover shall suffice to inable her majesty and the whole kingdom , with no less quantity of treasure , than the king of Spain have in all the Indies east and west , which he possess , which if the same be consider and follow , ere the Spaniard enforce the same , and if her majesty will undertake it , i will be content to lose her highness favour and : good opinion for ever , and my life withal , if the same be not find rather to exceed , than to equal whatsoever be in this discourse promise or declare . i will now refer the reader to the follow discourse , with the hope that the perilous and chargeable labour and endeavour of such as thereby seek the profit and honour of her majesty , and the english nation , shall by man of quality and virtue receive such construction , and good acceptance , as themselves will look to be reward withal in the like .
