sudden approach of winter , bring with it continual fog , and thick . mist , tempest and rage of weather ; also contrariety of current descend from the cape of Florida unto cape Briton and cape raze , will fall out to be great and irresistible impediment unto our further proceed for that year , and compel we to winter in those north and cold region . wherefore suppress all objection to the contrary , we resolve to begin our course northward , and to follow direct as we may , the trade way unto Newfoundland : 42 from whence after our refresh and reparation of want , we intend without delay ( by God permission ) to proceed into the south , not omit any river or bay which in all that large tract of land appear to our view worthy of search . immediate we agree upon the manner of our course and order to be observe in our voyage ; which be deliver in write unto the captain and master of every ship a copy in manner follow . every ship have deliver two bullet or scroll , the one seal up in wax , the other leave open : in both which be include several watchword . that open , serve upon our own coast or the coast of Ireland : the other seal , be promise on all hand not to be break up until we shall be clear of the irish coast ; which from thenceforth do serve until we arrive and meet altogether in such harbour of the Newfoundland as be agree for our Rendez vouz . the say watchword be requisite to know our consort whensoever by night , either by fortune of weather , our fleet disperse shall come together again ; or one shall hale another ; or if by ill watch and steerage one ship shall chance to fall aboard of another in the dark . the reason of the bullet seal be to keep secret that watchword while we be upon our own coast , lest any of the company steal from the fleet may bewray the same : which know to a enemy , he may board we by night without mistrust , have our own watchword . .
