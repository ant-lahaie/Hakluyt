conclude , by respect only the first . cause of heat , which be the consideration of the angle of the sun beam , by a certain similitude , that whereas the sun shine never above twelve hour , more than eight of they will be cool and pleasant even to we , much more to they that be acquaint always with such warm place . so there remain less than four hour of any excessive heat , and that only in the two summer day of the year , that be the eleven day of march , and the foure - vii 257 r teenth of September : for under the equinoctial they have two summer , the one in march , and the other in September , which be our spring and autumn : and likewise two winter , in June and December , which be our summer and winter , as may well appear to he that have only taste the principle of the sphere . but if the sun be in either Tropic , or approach near thereunto , then may we more easy measure the force of his meridian altitude , that it strike upon the equinoctial . as for example , the twelve of June the sun will be in the first degree of Cancer . then look what force the heat of the sun have under the equinoctial , the same force and great it have in all that parallel , where the pole be elevate between fourty and seven , Paris in . and fourty and eight degree . and therefore Paris in France ss as prance the twelve day of June sustain more heat of the Equinoc - the sun , than saint Thomas hand lie near the tiall in June , same meridian do likewise at noon , or the hand Taprobana , Moluccae , or the firm land of Peru in America , which all lie underneath the equinoctial . for upon the twelve day of June aforesaid , the sun beam at noon do make a isoscheles triangle , who vertex be the centre of the sun ,
