i assemble master Walker , master Shawe , master jeflry , the master , the master mate , and venture werg the pilot , to who i show that i be desirous to sever , and go back to seek our admiral , whereunto the master , never meet pilot , and master mate answer direct , that we can afterward . not fetch the isle where we leave they , and to meet they in go back it be very unlikely and to we dangerous many way , aswell for fall into the lap of the Spaniard , as to be put on a lee shore : whereupon all the rest advise i to stand off into the sea , whereunto i assent , remember withal , that time spend consume victuali , and how long we have beat up and down in the same bay before , to get in with calm and contrary wind . thus we conclude that m . Walker shall set down each man opinion , and we set to our hand , and from henceforth he to keep a register of all our proceed , as m . Maddox do aboard the admiral . the first day of February , we go east by south , and east southeast with a stout gale : and go the same course the 3 . 4 . and 5 . day follow . 197 the 5 . day about 10 . a clock in the forenoon m . Walker die , who have be weak and sick of the bloody flix 6 . day , we take a view of his thing , and prise they , and heave he over board , and shoot a piece for his knell . the 14 . day i call into my cabin the two merchant , the master and the pilot , show they our want of victual and other necessary : whereupon they and i conclude , that it be best for we to return to our country , with as little loss of time and expense of victual as may be , be without hope of relief upon this
