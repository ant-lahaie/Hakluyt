those kind : but they show i that they have no knowledge of they , and wonder at all of they , and by sign 1 come to understand that the thing which they most esteem and reverence be the sun : and i signify unto they that i come from a notable the sun . whereat they marveil , and then they begin to behold i from the top to the toe , and show i more favour than they do before ; and when i ask they for food , they bring i such abundance that i be enforce twice to call for the boat to put it into they , and from that time forward of all the thing which they bring i they fling up into the air one part unto the sun , and afterward turn towards i to give i the other part : and so i be always better serve and esteem of they as well in draw of the boat up the river , as also in give i food to eat : and they show i so great love , that when i stay they will have carry we in their arm unto their house : and in no kind of thing they will break my commandment : and for my surety , i will they not to carry any weapon in my sight : and they be so careful to do so , that if any man come new thither with they , sudden they will go and meet he to cause he to lay they down far from i : and i show they that i take great pleasure in their so do : and to some of the chief of they i give certain little napkin and other trifle ; for if i shall have give somewhat to every one of they in particular , all the small ware in swarm of new Spain will not have suffice . sometime it fall m / ' k out ( such be the great love and good will which they show i ) that if any Indians come thither by chance with their weapon , and if any one be warn to leave they behind he , if by negligence , or because he understand they not at the first warning , he have not lay they 287 a exceed great current of the river . away , they will run unto he , and take they from he by force , and will break they in piece in my presence . afterwards they take the rope so love , and with strive one with another for it , that we have no need to pray they to do it . wherefore if we have not have this help , the current of the river be exceed great , and our man that draw the rope be not well acquaint with that occupation , it will have be impossible for we to have get up the river so against the stream . when i perceive that they understand i in all thing , and that i likewise understand they , i think good to try by some way or other to make a good entrance to find some good issue to obtain my desire : and i cause certain cross to be make of certain small stick and paper , and among other when i give any thing i give they these as thing of most price and kiss they , make sign unto they that they shall honour they and make great account of they , and that they shall wear they at their neck : give they to understand that this sign be from heaven , and they take they and kiss they , and lift they up aloft , and seem great to rejoice thereat when they do so , and sometime i take they into my boat , show they great good will , and sometime i give they of those trifle which i carry with i . and at length the matter grow to such issue , that i have not paper and stick enough to make cross . in this manner that day i be very well accompany , until that when night approach i seek to launch out into the river , and go to ride in the midst of the stream , and they come to ask leave of i to depart , say that they will return the next day with victual to visit i , and so by little and little they depart , so that there stay not above fifty which make fire over against we , and stay there all night call we , and before the day be perfect break , they leap into the water and swim unto we ask for the rope , and we give it they with a good will , thank God for the good provision which 288 1540 - hee give we to go up the river : for the indian be so many , that if they have go about to let our passage , although we have be many more than we be , they may have do it .
