Caroli , as all the rest of the river be rise four or five foot in height , so as it be not possible by the strength of any man , or with any boat whatsoever to row into the river against the stream . i therefore send captain thy , captain green vile , my nephew John Gylbert , my cousin butshead Gorges , captain Clarke , and some thirty shot more to coast the river by land , and to go to a town some twenty mile over the valley call Amnatapoi , and they Amnatapol , a find guide there , to go far towards the mountain iowne - foote to another great town call Capurepana , belong to a cacique call Haharacoa ( that be a nephew to old Topiawari king of Arromaia our chief friend ) because this town and province of Capurepana adjoin to Macureguarai , which be a frontier town of the empire : and the mean while my self with captain Gifford , captain Calfield , Edward Hancocke , and some half a dozen shot march over land to view the strange overfal of the river of Caroli which roar so far off , and also to see the plain adjoin , and the rest of the province of Canuri : i send also captain Whiddon , William connocke , and some eight shot with they , to see if they can find any minerail stone alongst the river side . when we be come to the top of the first the strange hill of the plain adjoin to the river , we behold werfal ‘ ° f that wonderful breach of water , which run down Canl1 " Caroli : and may from that mountain see the river how it run in three part , above twenty mile off , and there appear some ten or twelve overfal in sight , 403 every one as high over the other as a church - tower , which fall with that fury , that the rebound of water make it seem , as if it have be all cover over with a great shower of rain : and in some place we take it at the first for a smoke that have rise over some great town . for my own part i be well persuade from thence to have return , be a very ill footman , but the rest be all so desirous to go near the say strange thunder of water , as they draw i on by little and little , till we come into the next valley where we may better discern a mostbeauti - the same . i never see a more beautiful country , nor full country . more lively prospect , hill so raise here and there over the valley , the river wind into diverse branch , the plain adjoin without bush or stubble , all fair green grass , the ground of hard sand easy to march on , either for horse or foot , the dear cross in every path , the bird towards the evening sing on every tree with a thousand several tune , crane and herons of white , crimson , and carnation perch in the river side , the air fresh with a gentle easterly wind , and every stone that we stoop to take up , promise either gold or silver by his complexion . your lordship shall see of many sort , and i hope some of they can be better under the sun , and yet we have no mean but with our dagger and finger to tear they out here and there , the abundance of rock be most hard of that minerali spar afore -^ sparre say , which be like a flint , and be altogether as hard or ' hard , and beside the vein lie a fathom or two deep in the rock . but we want all thing requisite save only our desire and good will to have perform more if it have please God . to be short , when both our company return , each of they bring also several sort of stone that appear very fair , but be such as they find loose on the ground , and be for the most part but colour , and have not any gold fix in they , yet such as have no judgement or experience keep all that glister , and will not be persuade but it be rich because of the lustre , and bring of those , and of mar - 404 1595 - quesite with all , from Trinidad , and have deliver of those stone to be try in many place , and have thereby breed a opinion that all the rest be of the same : yet some of these stone i show afterward to a Spaniard of the Caracas , who tell i that it be el Madre del oro , that be the mother of gold , and that the mine be far in the ground . but it shall be find a weak policy in i , either to betray my self , or my country with imagination , neither be i so far in love with that lodging , watch , care , peril , disease , ill savour , bad fare , and many other mischiefs that accompany these voyage , as to woo my self again into any of they , be i not assure that the sun cover not so much riches in any part of the earth . captain Whiddon , and our chirurgeon Nicholas millechap bring i a kind of stone like saphire , what they may prove i know not . i show they to some of the Orenoqueponi , and they promise to bring i to a mountain , that have of they very large piece grow diamond wise : whether it be crystal of the mountain , bristol - diamond , or saphire i do not yet know , but i hope the best , sure i be that the place be as likely as those from whence all the rich stone be bring , and in the same height or very near . on the left hand of this river Caroli be seat those nation which be call Iwarawakeri before remember , which be enemy to the Epuremei : and on the head of it adjoin to the great lake Cassipa , be situate those other nation which also resist Inga , and the Epuremei , call Cassepagotos , Eparegotos
