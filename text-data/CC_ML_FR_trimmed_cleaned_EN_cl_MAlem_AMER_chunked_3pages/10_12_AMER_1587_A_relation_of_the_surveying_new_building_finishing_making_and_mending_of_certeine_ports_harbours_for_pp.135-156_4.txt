, for there be no pasture at all to breed cattle , for all kind of flesh which be spend in this place be bring from Panama : so towards the south there be a very good place , where the city may be new build on a certain plain ground which lie at the foot of certain mountain , which be not very high ; and in this place there run three little river of fresh water very sweet and good , and here be good arable ground to till and to ten 145 king sow Maiz and other kind of grain . also in this circuit there be great stone to make lime , and these stone must needs prove very good as i do think , but we never have any trial thereof . this harbour have all thing necessary to build a . city , where your majesty may have your army and fleet of ship to ride at a anchor in safety without danger of loose : and it be a very healthful country , and where the city shall be build it be all stony ground : and forasmuch as the rain water which do fall from the mountain may do hurt unto the city , there at the foot of the mountain we will make a great pond to receive in all the water which do fall from the mountain , and so from thence to go into the sea , as more at large your majesty may see by my platform . if it will please your majesty , it be good that the city of number de Dios may be bring and build in this harbour : it will not be very chargeable unto the citizen by reason that all their house be make of timber , and they may benefit themselves with the same again , and likewise with the tile of their house : the great charge will be to land timber and to cut down the mountain of wood . if it please your majesty that the say city of number de Dios shall be build in this harbour the first thing which must be finish be to make up this high way , and so to pull down the church which be in number de dios , and the contractation house , and so new build it in this harbour : and then to command all the fleet of ship from time to time to come and unlade their good in this say Puerto bello : and that those merchant and factor of Spain which be lyger in Panama and number de dios , shall come to this harbour and build anew their warehouse for receive of their good . so by these mean in short time it will be great inhabit with people : also the fleet shall not pass so many danger as they daily do in number de dios : neither will there so many people die as there daily doe in number de 146 dios : and the cause thereof be , that those labour man which do use to unlade those merchandise , be all the whole day wade in the water up to the armpit to bring the pack of cloth and other commodity aland ; for there be no land place where there can come any boat to land any good close to the shore , so this wade and the parch of the sun be the cause why so many do dye of a burn fever . there be but 60 . dwell house in number de dios , and but thirty dweller which do continual dwell there , and the rest do go to Panama after the fleet be go , and then this town do remain desolate , every man forsake it because it be so full of disease . in the enter in of this harbour for the more security thereof and defence of the town it be needful to build upon the top of the mount which lie to the northward , a little fort foursquare that will hold four or five piece of ordinance , and to appoint six man to watch and ward ; and this be do we shall have no occasion to make any more defence , by reason the country be full of rock and filthy way , and all full of wood round about the harbour . and so likewise on the other side to build a little tower in manner of a fort , with eight piece of ordinance and five and twenty soldier to keep it . and this will be of more importance because it must be build on the town side . and a little beyond this place on the northside there lie a creek , where there be a very good anker in eight fathom water : so this fort be build in this place it will defend the harbour and offend the enemy : and will defend the coast along and a point of the land which do run from the east to the west , and reach to the hand of buena Ventura . And put case that the fort which be build on the other side do decay , or be take by the enemy , with this other fort we may defend the city very well , if the enemy shall chance to come into the harbour , and be succour and help by the 147 citizen , and twenty musketeer be plant upon a mount which lie over the fort , will be sufficient to defend we from a good many of our enemy , that shall come to assault we , because all the country be full of rock and stone , and full of mountain . so from this wood there may a way be make to go to the city , and to join with that way which shall go to Panama ; and this may be do with small charge . this harbour do lie in nine degree and one tierce , and if occasion shall serve we may stop up the way which do go to Capira , and the rest of the way which go from number de dios to Venta de cruze , accord as it be certify i by the negro call Simerons ; for they tell i that this way will not be very troublesome . although in the winter it be report that here be good store of water in this place , which in the summer be all dry up , and where these water be , there we may build a causey , to which purpose there
