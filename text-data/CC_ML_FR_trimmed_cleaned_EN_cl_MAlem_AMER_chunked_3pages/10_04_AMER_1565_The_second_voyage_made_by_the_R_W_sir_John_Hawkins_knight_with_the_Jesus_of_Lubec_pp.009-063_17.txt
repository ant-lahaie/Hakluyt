with certain soul - Â£ aujmnierei diers therein . to who our captain send to understand of a watering - place , where he may convenient take it in , and to have licence for the same , he straight , because there be no convenient place but up the river five league , where the water be fresh , do send he a pilot for the more expedition thereof , to bring in one of his bark , which go in with other boat provide for the same purpose , anchor before the fort , into the which our captain go ; where he be by the general , with other captain and soldier , very gentle entertained , who declare unto he the time of their be there , which be fourteen month , with the extremity they be drive to for want of victual , have bring very little with they ; in which place they be two hundred man at their first come , have in short space eat all the maiz they can buy of the inhabitant about they , and therefore be drive certain of they to serve a king of the floridians against other his enemy , for mill and other victual : which have get , can not serve they , be so many , so long bread make a time : but want come upon they in such sort , that ofakorn . be fajne to gather acorn , which be stamp small , and often wash , to take away the bitterness of they , they do use for bread , eat withal sundry time , root , whereof they find many good and wholesome , and such as serve rather for medicine then for meat alone . but this hardness not content some of they , who will not take the pain so much as to fish in the river before their door , but will have all thing put in their mouth , they do rebel against the captain , take away first his armour , and afterward imprison he : and so to the number of fourscore of they , depart with a bark and a pinnace , spoil their store of victuali , and take away a great part thereof with they , and so go to the island of Hispaniola and Jamaica a rove , where they spoil and peel the Spaniard ; and have take two caravel lade with wine and casavi , which be a bread make of root , and much other victual and treasure , have not the grace to depart therewith , but be of such haughty stomach , that they think their force to be such that no man dare meddle with they , and so keep harbour in Jamaica , go daily ashore at their pleasure . but God which will not suffer such evil doer unpunished , do indurate their heart in such sort , that they linger the time so long , that a ship and galliass be make out of Santa Domingo come thither into the harbour , and take twenty of they , whereof the most part be hang , and the rest carry into Spain , and some ( to the number of five and twenty ) escape in the pinnace , and come to Florida ; where at their land they be put in prison , and incontinent four of the chief being condemn , at the request of the soldier , do pass the harquebusier , and then be hang upon a gibbet . this lack of threescore man be a great discourage and weaken to the rest , for they be the best soldier that they have : for they have now make the inhabitant weary of they by their daily crave of maiz , have no ware leave to content they withal , and therefore be enforce to rob they , and to take away their victual perforce , which be the occasion that the floridians ( not well content therewith ) do take certain of their company in the wood , and slay they ; whereby there grow great war betwixt they and the Frenchman : and therefore they be but a few in number dare not venture abroad , but at such time as they be enforce thereunto for want of food to do the same : and go twenty harquebusier in a company , be set upon by eighteen king , have seven or eight hundred man , which with one of their bow slay one of their man , and hurt a dozen , and drive they all down to their boat ; who policy in fight be to be marvel at : for have shoot at diverse of their body which be arm , and perceive that their arrow do not prevail against the same , they shoot at their face and leg , which be the place that the Frenchman be hurt in . thus the Frenchman return , be in ill case by the hurt of their man , have not above forty soldier leave unhurt , whereby they may ill make any more invasion upon the floridians , and keep their fort withal : which they must have be drive unto , have not God send we thither for their succour ; for they have not above ten day victuali leave before we come . in which perplexity our captain see they , spare they out of his ship twenty barrel of meal , and four pipe of bean , with diverse other victual and necessary which he may convenient spare : and to help they the better homeward , whither they be bind before our come , at their request 55 the occasion of the fall out with the floridians . the french great relieve by m . Hawkins . we spare they one of our bark of fifty tun . notwithstanding the great want that the Frenchman have , the ground do yield victual sufficient , if they will have take pain to get the same ; but they be soldier , desire to live by the sweat of other man brow : for while they have peace with the floridians , they have fish sufficient , by wear which they make to catch the same : but when they grow to war , the floridians take away the same again , and then will not the Frenchman take the pain to make any more . the ground yield natural grape in great store , for in twenty the time that the Frenchman be there , they make 20 hogshead of it hogshead of wine . also
