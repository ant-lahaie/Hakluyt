we know not the secret of this u in 32 ae - current , whether it be cause by a river or by a strait : and so suppose that the coast which we have on our and red . right hand be close up without passage , we return back again , always descend southward by our degree , until we return unto the say haven of this return santa Cruz , find still along the coast a goodly and u pleasant country , and still see fire make by the ca $ ' Indians , and canoas mad of cane . we determine to take in fresh water at the haven of Santa Cruz , to ix 225 p run along the outward western coast , and to see what it be , if it please God . here we rest our self , and eat of the plum and fruit call Pithaias : they arrive and we enter into the port of Santa Cruz on Sunday ‘ ot ^ san ^’ 1 th ® * 8 ° f October and stay there eight day to take Qruz in wood and water rest our self all that while , that our man may strengthen and refresh themselves . our captain determine to divide among we certain garment of taffeta , with cloak and say , and a piece of taffeta , and likewise ordain , that we shall go on land to catch a couple of Indians , that they may talk with our interpreter , and that we may come to the knowledge of their language . whereupon thirteen of we go out of our ship by night , and lie in ambush in a place which be call the well of Grijalva , where we stay until noon between certain secret way , and can never see or descry any one Indian : wherefore we return the Spaniard to our ship , with two mastive - dog which we carry with they to catc ^ th ® Indians with more ease : and in our Indians return we find two Indians hide in certain thicket , ' which be come thither to spy what we do : but because we and our dog be weary , and think not on they , these Indians issue out of the thicket , and flee away , and we run after they , and our dog see they not : wherefore by reason of the read more of thickness of the wild thistle , and of the thorn and these staff briar , and because we be weary , we can never cat - i0 - overtake they : they leave behind they certain staff so fine wrought that they be very beautiful to behold , consider how cunning they be make with a handle and a cord to fling they . the nine and twenty of October be Wednesday , we set sail out of this haven of Santa Cruz with little wind , and in sail down the channel our ship call the Trinity come on ground upon certain sholde : this be at noon at a low water , and with all the remedy that we can use we can not draw she off , whereupon we be constrain to underprop she , and to stay 226 the next tide : and when the tide begin to increase we use all diligence to draw she off , and can not by any mean , whereat all the company and the captain be not a little grieve : for we think we shall have lose she there , although we cease not with all our might to labour with both our boat , and with our cable and capsten . in the end it please God about midnight at a full sea with the great force which we use to recover she , that we draw she off the sand , for which we give God most hearty thanks , and ride at anchor all the rest of the night , wait for daylight for fear of fall into any further danger or mishap . when day be come , we set forward with a fresh gale , and proceed on our voyage , direct our prow to the main sea , to see whether it will please God to let we discover the secret of this point . but whether it please not his great goodness , or whether it be for our sin , we spend eight day from this port , before we can double the point , by reason of contrary wind , and great rain , and lightning and darkness every night : also the wind grow so rage and tempestuous , that they make we all to quake , and to pray continual unto God to aid we . and hereupon we make our cable and anchor ready , and the chief pilot command we with all speed to cast anchor , and in this sort we pass our trouble : and whereas we ride in no security , he cause we forthwith to weigh our anchor , and to go whither the wind shall drive we . and in this sort we spend those eight day , turn back by night the same way that we have go by day , and sometime make good in the night that which we have lose in the day , not without great desire of all the company to have a wind which may set we forward on our voyage , be afflict with the misery which we endure by reason of the thunder , lightning , and rain , wherewith we be wet from top to toe , by reason of the toil which we have in weigh and cast of our anchor , as need require . and on one of these night , which be very dark 227 and tempestuous with wind and rain , because we think we shall have perish , be very near the shore , we pray unto God that he will vouchsafe to aid and save we without call our sin to remembrance . and straightway we see upon the shrowd of the Trinity as it be a candle , which of it self shine , and give a light , whereat all the company great rejoice , in such sort that we cease not to give thanks unto God . whereupon we assure our self , that of his mercy he will guide and save we , and will not suffer we to perish , as indeed it fall out ;
