by such a nation as have no iron instrument at all nor any of those help which our goldsmith have to work withal . the particular name of the people in Amapaia which give he these piece , be call anebas , and the river of Orenoque at that place be above 12 english mile broad , which may be from his out fall into the sea 700 or 800 mile . this province of Amapaia be a very low and a mar - ish ground near the river ; and by reason of the red water which issue out in small branch through the fenny and boggy ground , there breed diverse poisonful worm and serpent ; and the Spaniard not suspect , nor in any sort foreknow the danger , be infect with a grievous kind of flux by drink thereof ; and even the very horse poison therewith : insomuch as at the end of the 6 month , that they abide there , ten 369 2 a A .
