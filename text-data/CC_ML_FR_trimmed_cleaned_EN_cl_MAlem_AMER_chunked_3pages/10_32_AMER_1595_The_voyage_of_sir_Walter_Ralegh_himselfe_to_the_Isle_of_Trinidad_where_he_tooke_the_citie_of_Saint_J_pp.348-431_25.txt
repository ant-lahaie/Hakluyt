, and the Spaniard , those frontier be grow thin of people , and also great number be flee to other nation far off for fear of the Spaniard . after i receive this answer of the old man , we fall into consideration , whether it have be of better advice to have enter Macureguarai , and to have begin a war upon Inga at this time , yea or no , if the time of the year , and all thing else have sort . for my own part ( as we be not able to march it for the river , neither have any such strength as be requisite , and dare not abide the come of the winter , or to tarry any long from our ship ) i think it be evil counsel to have attempt it at that time , although the desire of gold will answer many objection : but it will have be in my opinion a utter overthrow to the enterprise , if the same shall be hereafter by her majesty attempt : for than ( whereas now they have hear we be enemy to the Spaniard and be send by her majesty to relieve they ) they will as good cheap have join with the Spaniard at our 413 15951 , , , return , as to have yield unto we , when they have prove that we come both for one errant , and that both seek but to sack and spoil they , but as yet our desire of gold , or our purpose of invasion be not know to they of the empire : and it be likely that if her majesty undertake the enterprise , they will rather submit themselves to her obedience then to the Spaniard , of who cruelty both themselves and the borderer have already taste : and therefore till i have know her majesty pleasure , i will rather have lose the sack of one or two town ( although they may have be very profitable ) then to have deface or endanger the future hope of so many million , and the great good , and rich trade which England may be possess of thereby . i be assure now that they will all die even to the last man against the Spaniard in hope of our succour and return : whereas otherwise if i have either lay hand on the borderer , or ransom the lord , as Berreo do , or invade the subject of Inga , i know all have be lose for hereafter . after that i have resolve Topiawari lord of Aromaia , that i can not at this time leave with he the company he desire , and that i be content to forbear the enterprise against the Epuremei till the next year , he free give i his only son to take with i into England , and hope , that though he himself have but a short time to live , yet that by our mean his son shall be establish after his death : and i leave with he one Francis Francis sparrow , a servant of captain Gifford , ( who be sparrow . desirous to tarry , and can describe a country with his pen ) and a boy of i call Hugh Goodwin , to learn the language . i after ask the manner how the Epuremei wrought those plate of gold , and how they can melt it out of the stone ; he tell i that the most of the gold which they make in plate and image , the lake off be not sever from the stone , but that on the lake of Manoa . Manoa , and in a multitude of other river they gather it in grain of perfect gold and in piece as big as small 414 stone , and that they put it to a part of copper , otherwise they can not work it , and that they use a great earthen pot with hole round about it , and when they have mingle the gold and copper together , they fasten cane to the hole , and so with the breath of man they increase the fire till the metal run , and then they cast it into mould of stone and clay , and so make those plate and image . i have send your honour of two sort such as i can by chance recover , more to show the manner of they , then for the value : for i do not in any sort make my desire of gold know , because i have neither time , nor power to have a great quantity . i give among they many more piece ot gold , than i receive , of the new money of 20 shilling with her majesty picture to wear , with promise that they will become her servant thenceforth . i have also send your honour of the ore , whereof i know some be as rich as the earth yield any , of s ^- ore . most rich which i know there be sufficient , if nothing else be to be hope for . but beside that we be not able to tarry and search the hill , so we have neither pioner , bar , ledge , nor wedge of iron to break the ground , without which there be no work in mine : but we see all the hill with stone of the colour of gold and silver , and we try they to be no marquesite , and therefore such as the Spaniard call el madre del oro , or , the mother of gold , which be a undoubted assurance of the general abundance : and my self see the outside of many mine of the spar , which i know to be the same that all covet in this world , and of those , more than i will speak of . have learn what i can in Canuri and Aromaia , and receive a faithful promise of the principall of those province to become servant to her majesty , and to resist the Spaniard , if they make any attempt in our absence , and that they will draw in the nation about the lake of Cassipa , and those iwarawaqueri , i the lake of then part from old Topiawari , and receive his son c â„¢ 1 ? 0 - 415 for a pledge between we , and leave with he two
