, and have be glad peaceable to hold their own signiory at home , resign all that unto other , which they have get abroad by hard adventure , and much effusion of blood . the king of Spain can but discern , that his spacious empire and kingdom be so many , and so far divide one from another , be like the member of a monstrous body , tie together with cable only . for take away the traffic of unnece - 484 sarie commodity transport out of Spain : those huge country of the Indies have no common link of affinity , law , language , or religion , and be of themselves able to maintain themselves without foreign commerce , be not so simple , as not to know their own strength , and to find , that they do rather possess Spaniard , then that they be possess by they . he can be ignorant that Spain it self be on all side environ with many puissant enemy , mighty and great prince , who know it to be rich without man , confident without reason , proud and adventurous without mean sufficient ; may happy confederate to chastise he , as a insolent intruder , and disturber of all quietness ; and go no further than Spain it self , may even there shake the foundation of his long contrive devise , and in one act redeem the time , control his aspire humour , and break the band in sunder that import servitude , and subversion to all the dominion of Christendom . again , his counsel may well inform he , that to dispeople and disable himself at home , in hope to obtain Guiana , be a country strong of it self , and defend with infinite multitude of indian enemy , be rich , and by the inhabitant offer unto the english : he contempt towards we will seem so intolerable and despiteful , as may be sufficient to provoke we , though otherwise we have no such inclination ; if he unprovide of able help to effect it , shall rest himself on a careless presumption , that we can , we dare not , we will not stir in a matter that promises we so great benefit , and may so high offend he . he may be persuade , that to leave no other succour or safety to his nakedness , but the old stale practice of spread rumour , and give out false intelligence of preparation to invade England , thereby to keep we at home ; or else of hire and suborn some machavellian under hand by secret conveyance , to stop the course of our proceed ; or last , of 485 procure some wild outlaw to disquiet our tranquillity ; be but a poor , weak , and uncertain stay to uphold his estate by . and yet set such like drift aside : what can be imagine likely to hinder we from prevail in Guiana , rather than he , who disadvantage be to be encumber with the self same , and manifold moor impediment , then can any way be suppose , with good cause to impeach , or divorce we from so profitable a attempt ? all this notwithstanding , if the spanish king not be able to dissemble his desire , or bear the loss of this one kingdom ; put himself out of his strength at home , and expose his people to the hazard of all casualty abroad , be resolve , whatsoever shall happen , not to relinquish Guiana , but to keep this one iron more in the fire , on no other assurance , but a peremptory disdain of prevention : if he appear so eager bend for Guiana , as if it be enact for a law among themselves , vii and modis to thrust for it , and not to hear , conceive , or believe any thing , that may dissuade or deter from the conquest thereof : it then appertain unto we , not to enforce those objection against our self , which he with less reason reject as frivolous ; since by how much the more earnest he be in follow this purpose , by so much the less cause have we to be divert from it . to such as shall be willing further to wade in this argument ; for brevity sake , i do propose only this bare assertion : that England and Guiana conjoin , be strong , and more easy defend , then if England alone shall repose her self on her own force , and powerfulness . the reason that may be infer to prove this need no rationail discourse : they be all intimate in the only example of Spain it self ; which without the Indies be but a purse without money , or a paint sheath without a dagger . in sum : it seem unto i , that whereas the difficulty of perform this enterprise have be produce for a discouragement : it be 486 a dull conceit of strange weakness in our self , to distrust our own power so much , or at least , our own heart and courage ; as value the spanish nation to be omnipotent ; or yield that the poor Portugal have that master spirit and conquer industry , above we ; as to be able to seat himself among the many mighty prince of the east Indies , to frontier China , to hold in subjection the philippinas , Zeilan , Calecut , goa , ormus , Mozambique , and the rest ; the navigation be so tedious and full of peril : to suffer our self to be put back for worthless cipher , out of place , without account . all which region be now also by the late conquest of Portugal , entitle to the spanish king : to who the colony of those part do yet general refuse to swear fealty and allegiance : and the care depend on he , not only in govern they in the east , so far off ; but also of order and strengthen of those disunit , scatter , and ill guard empire and province in the west : it may very well be allege to the say spanish king , that it be more wisdom for he to assure and fortify some part of those already get , than to begin the conquest of Guiana , so far separate
