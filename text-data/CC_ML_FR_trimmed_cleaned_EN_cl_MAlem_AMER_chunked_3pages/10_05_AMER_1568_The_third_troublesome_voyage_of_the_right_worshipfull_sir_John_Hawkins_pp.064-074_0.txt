where i my self have one of the great 64 1567 . wound , yet thanks be to God , escape . from thence we pass the time upon the coast of Guinea , search with all diligence the river from Rio Grande , unto Sierra Leona , till the twelve of Januarie , in which time we have not get together a hundred and fifty negro : yet notwithstanding the sickness of our man , and the late time of the year come - mand we away : and thus have nothing wherewith to seek the coast of the west India , i be with the rest of our company in consultation to go to the coast of the mine , hope there to have obtain some gold for our ware , and thereby to have defray our charge . but even in that present instant , there come to we a negro , send from a king , oppress by other king his neighbour , desire our aid , with promise that as many negro as by these war may be obtain , aswell of his part as of we , shall be at our pleasure : whereupon we conclude to give aid , and send 120 of our man , which the 15 of Januarie , assault a town of the negro of our town of ally adversary , which have in it 8000 inhabitant , 8 °°° ” * 8 ™ be very strong impale and fence after their ' manner , but it be so well defend , that our man prevail not , but lose six man and forty hurt : so that our man send forthwith to i for more help : whereupon consider that the good success of this enterprise may high further the commodity of our voyage , i go my self , and with the help of the king of our side , assault the town , both by land and sea , and very hardly with fire ( their house be cover with dry palm leave ) obtain the town , put the inhabitant to flight , where we take 250 person , man , woman , and child , and by our friend the king of our side , there be take 600 prisoner , whereof we hope to have have our choice : but the negro ( in which nation be seidome or never find 5 in truth ) mean nothing less : for that night he re - negro . move his camp and prisoner , so that we be ten 65 e fain to content we with those few which we have get our self . now have we obtain between four and five hundred negro , wherewith we think it somewhat reasonable to seek the coast of the west Indies , and there , for our negro , and other our merchandise , we hope to obtain , whereof to countervail our charge with some gain , whereunto we proceed with all diligence , furnish our water , take fuel , and depart the coast of Guinea the three of February , continue at the sea with a passage more hard , then before have be accustom till the 27 day of march , which day we have sight of a hand , call Dominica , upon the coast of the west Indies , in fourteen degree : from thence we coast from place to place , make our traifike with the Spaniards as we may , somewhat hardly , because the king have straight command all his governor in those part , by no mean to suffer any trade to be make with we : notwithstanding we have reasonable trade , and courteous entertainment , from the he of Margarita unto Cartagena , without any thing great worth the note , save at Capo de la Vela , in a town call Rio de la Hacha ( from whence come all the pearl ) the treasurer who have the charge there , will by no mean agree to any trade , or suffer we to take water , he have fortify his town with diverse bulwark in all place where it may be enter , and furnish himself with a hundred harquebusier , so that he think by famine to have enforce we to have put a land our negro : of which purpose he have not great fail , unless we have by force enter the town : which ( after we can by no mean obtain his favour ) we be enforce to do , and so with two hundred man break in upon their bulwark , and enter the town with the loss only of two man of our part , and no hurt do to the Spaniard because after their volley of shot discharge , they all flee . thus have
