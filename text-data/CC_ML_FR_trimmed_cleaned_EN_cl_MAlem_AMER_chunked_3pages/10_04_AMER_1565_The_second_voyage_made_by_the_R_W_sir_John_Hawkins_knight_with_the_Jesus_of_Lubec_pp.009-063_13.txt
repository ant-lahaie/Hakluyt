conveyance of their falcon . the 31 . of may we depart , keep our course to Hispaniola , and the four of June we have sight of a island , which we make to be Jamaica , marvel that by the vehement course of the sea we shall be drive so far to leeward : for set our course to the west end of Hispaniola we fall with the middle of Jamaica , notwithstanding that to all man sight it show a headland , but they be all deceive by the cloud that lie upon the land two day together , in such sort that we think it to be the head land of the say island . and a Spaniard be in the ship , who be a merchant , and inhabitant in Jamaica , have occasion to go to guinie , and be by treason take of the negro , and afterward buy by the Tangomangos , be by our captain bring from thence , and have his passage to go into his country , who perceive the land , make as though he know every place thereof and point to certain place which he name to be such a place , and such a man ground , and that behind such a point be the harbour , but in the end he point so from one point to another , that we be a leeboord of all place , and find our self at the west end of Jamaica before we be aware of it , and be once to leeward , there be no get up again , the deceitful ! force of the current . so that by trust of the Spaniard knowledge , our captain seek not to speak with any of the inhabitant , which if he have not make himself sure of , he will have do as his custom be in other place : but this man be a plague not only to our captain , who make he loose by overshoot the place 2000 pound by hide , which he may have get , but also to himself , who be three year out of his country , and in great misery in guinie , both among the negro and Tangomangos , and in hope to come to his wife and friend , as he make sure account , in that at his go into the pinnace , when he go to shore he put on his new clothes , and for joy fling away his old , can not afterward find any habitation , neither there nor in all Cuba , which we sail all along , but it fall out ever by one occasion or other , that we be put beside the same , so that he be fame to be bring into England , and it happen to he as it do to a duke of Samaria , when the Israelite be besiege , and be in great misery with hunger , and be tell by the prophet Elizaeus , that a bushel ! of flower shall be sell for a sickle , will not believe he , but think it unpossible : and for that cause Elizaeus prophesy he shall see the same do , but he shall not eat thereof : so this man be absent three year , and not ever think to have see his own country , do see the same , go upon it , and yet be it not his fortune to come to it , or to any habitation , whereby to remain with his friend accord to his desire . thus have sail along the coast two day , we depart the seven of June , be make to believe by the Spaniard that it be not Jamaica , but rather Hispaniola , of which opinion the captain also be , because that which he make Jamaica seem to be but a piece of the land , and thereby take it rather to be Hispaniola , by the lie of the coast , and also for that be ignorant of the force of the current , he can not believe he be so far drive to leeward , and therefore set his course to Jamaica , and after certain day not find the same , perceive then certain that the island which he be at before be Jamaica , and that the cloud do deceive he , whereof he marvel not a little : and this mistake of the place come to as ill a pass as the overshoot of Jamaica : for by this do he also overpass a place in Cuba , call Santa Cruz , where , as he be inform , be great store of hide to be have : and thus be disappoint of two of his port , where he think to have raise great profit by his traffic , and also to have find great refresh of victual and water for his man , he be now disappoint great , and such want he have of fresh water , that he be force to seek the shore to obtain the same , which he have sight of after certain day overpass with storm and contrary wind , but yet not of the main of Cuba , but of certain island in number two hundred , whereof the most part be desolate of inhabitant : by the which island the captain pass in his pinnace , can find no fresh water until he come to a island big than all the rest , call the isle of pina , where we ancker with our ship the 16 . of June , and find water , which although it be neither so toothsome as run water , by the mean it be stand , and but the water of rain , and also be near the sea be brackish , yet do we not refuse it , but be more glad thereof , as the time then require , than we shall have be another time with fine conduit water . thus be reasonable water we be desirous to depart , because the place be not very convenient for such ship of charge as they be , because there be many shoal to leeward , which also lie open to the sea for any wind that shall blow : and therefore the captain make the more haste away , which be not unneedful : for little soon be their anchor weigh , and foresail set , but there arise such a storm , that they have not much to spare for double out of the shoal : for one of
