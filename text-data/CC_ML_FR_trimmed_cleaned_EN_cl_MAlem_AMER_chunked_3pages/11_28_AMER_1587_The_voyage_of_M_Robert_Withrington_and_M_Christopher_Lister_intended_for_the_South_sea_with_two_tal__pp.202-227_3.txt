Anthony , 212 both , you know , that the last word that my lord have with we in such a chamber be , that in any case we shall follow our voyage only for the south sea , except by the way , we may perchance meet with such a purchase , as that we may return with 6000 pound : and therefore i see no safety , how we may dare offer to go back again , be so near the strait as we be : for my part i neither dare nor will consent unto it , except we be further force , then yet we be . my account be this , that he that die for this year be excuse for the next , and i rather choose death , than to return in disgrace with my lord . hereunto both the captain and master of the admiral reply that they be all of that mind : yet notwithstanding , that in go room the voyage be in better possibility to be perform , then in winter either in the strait , or at port S . Julian , all thing consider and so agree , and conclude all in one , they be determine present to bear up . the
