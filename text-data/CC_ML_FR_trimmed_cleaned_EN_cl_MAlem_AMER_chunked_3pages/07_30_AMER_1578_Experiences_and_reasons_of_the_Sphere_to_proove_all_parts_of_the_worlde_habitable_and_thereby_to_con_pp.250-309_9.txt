the middle zone under the equinoctial , where the twilight be short , and the night dark than in any other place , because the sun go under their horizon so deep , even to their antipode . we see in England in the summer night , when the sun go not far under the horizon , , that by the light of the moon and star we may travel all night , and if occasion be , do some other labour also . and there be no man that doubt whither our cattle can see to feed in the night , see we be so well certify thereof by our experience : and by reason of the sphere our night shall be dark than any time under the pole . the astronomer consent that the sun descend 274 from our upper hemisphere at the 18 parallel under the horizon make a end of twilight , so that at length the dark night ensue , and that afterward in the morning the sun approach again within as many parallel , do drive away the night by access of the twilight . again , by the position of the sphere under the pole , the horizon , and the equinoctial be all one . Theise revolution therefore that be parallel to the equinoctial be also parallel to the horizon , so that the sun descend under that horizon , and there describe certain parallel not far distant , do not bring dark night to those region until it come to the parallel distant 18 degree from the equinoctial , that be , about the 21 degree of Scorpio , which will be about the 4 day of our November , and after the winter solstitium , the sun return back again to the 9 degree of Aquarius , which will be about the 19 of January ; during which time only , that be , from the 4 day of November until the 19 day of January , which be about six week space , those region do want the commodity of twilight : therefore , during the time of these say six month of darkness under the pole , the night be destitute of the benefit of the sun and the say twilight only for the the region space of six week or thereabouts . and yet neither this under thepole time of six week be without remedy from heaven ; for the moon with her increase light have access at that time , and illuminate the month lack light every one of themselves several half the course of that month , by who benefit it come to pass that the night name extreme dark possess those region no long than one month , neither that continual , or all at one time , but this also divide into two sort of short night , of the which either of they endure for the space of 15 day , and be illuminate of the moon accord . and this reason be gather out of the sphere , whereby we may testify that the summer be warm and fruitful , and the winter night under the pole be tolerable to live creature . and if it be so that the winter and 275 winter night time of darkness there be very cold , yet have not nature unfer ^ leave they provide therefore : for there the beast be sng crea - cover with hair so much the thick inn how much the ture . vehemency of cold be great ; by reason whereof the best and rich fur be bring out of the cold region . also the fowl of these cold country have thick skin , thick feather , and more store of down then in other hot place . Oure english man that travel to saint Nicholas , and go a fish to Wardhouse , enter far within the circle arctike , and so be in the freeze zone , and yet there , aswell as in island and all along those northern sea , they find the great store of the great fish that be ; as whale , etc and also abundance of mean fish ; as herring , cod , haddock , bret , etc which argue that the sea as well as the land may be and be well frequent and inhabit in the cold country . a objection but some perhaps will marvel there shall be such Â° f Meta incog - temperate place in the region about the pole , when at ' under 62 degree in latitude our captain Frobisher and his company be trouble with so many and so great mountain of fleet ice , with so great storm of cold , with such continual snow on top of mountain , and with such barren soil , there be neither wood nor tree , but low shrub , and such like . to all which objection may be answer thus : first , those infinite island of ice be engender and congeal in time of winter , and now by the great heat of summer be thaw , and then by ebb , flood , wind , and current , be drive to and fro , and trouble the fleet ; so that this be a argument to prove the heat in summer there to be great , that be able to thaw so monstrous mountain of ice . as for continual snow on top of mountain , it be there not otherwise then be in the hot part of the middle zone , where also lie great snow all the summer long upon top of mountain , because there be not sufficient space for the sun reflection , whereby the snow shall be melt . touch the cold stormy 276 wind and the barrenness of the country , it be there as it be in Cornwall and Devonshire in England , which part though we know to be fruitful and fertile , yet on the north side thereof all alongst the coast within seven or eight mile off the sea there can neither hedge nor tree grow , although they be diligent by art husband and see unto : and the cause thereof be the northern drive wind , which come from the sea be so bitter and sharp that they kill all the young and tender plant , and suffer scarce any thing to grow ; and so be it in the island of Meta
