. at the end of which 418 five day we come to a town within five league of Mexico , which be call Quoghliclan , where we also stay one whole day and two night , where be a fair house of grey friar , howbeit we see none of they . here we be tell by the Spaniard in the town , that we have not pass fifteen english mile from thence to Mexico , whereof we be all very joyful and glad , hope that when we come thither , we shall either be relieve , and set free out of bond , or else be quick dispatch out of our life : for see our self thus carry bind from place to place , although some use we courteous , yet can we never joy , nor be merry till we may perceive our self set free from that bondage , either by death or otherwise . the next morning we depart from thence on our journey towards Mexico , and so travel till we come within two league of it , where there be build by the Spaniard a very fair church , call our lady church , in which there be a image of our lady of silver and gilt , be as high , and as large as a tall woman , in which church , and before this image , there be as many lamp of silver as there be day in the year , which upon high day be all light . whensoever any Spaniards pass by this church , although they be on horse back , they will alight , and come into the church , and kneel before the image , and pray to our lady to defend they from all evil ; so that whether he be horseman or footman he will not pass by , but first go into the church , and pray as aforesaid , which if they do not , they think and believe that they shall never prosper : which image they call in the spanish tongue , Nuestra sennora de Guadalupe . at nuestr a this place there be certain cold bath , which arise , spring - sennora - ing up as though the water do see : the water whereof be somewhat brackish in taste , but very good for any that have any sore or wound , to wash themselves therewith , for as they say , it heal many : and every year once upon our lady day the people use to repair thither to offer , and to pray in that church before the image , and 419 certain Englishman take prisoner at the fight at Sant Juan de ullua . they say that our lady of Guadalupe do work a number of miracle . about this church there be not any town of Spaniards that be inhabit , but certain Indians do dwell there in house of their own country building . here we be meet with a great number of Spaniards on horseback , which come from Mexico to see we , both gentleman , and man of occupation , and they come as people to see a wonder : we be still call upon to march on ; and so about four of the clock in the afternoon of the say day we enter into the city of Mexico , by the way or street call la call Santa Catherina : and we stay not in any place till we come to the house or palace of the vice Roy , don Martin Henriques , which stand in the midst of the city , hard by the market place , call la plaga deal Marquese . we have not stay any long time at this place , but there be bring we by the Spaniard from the market place great store of meat , sufficient to have satisfy five time so many as we be : some also give we hat , and some give we money : in which place we stay for the space of two hour , and from thence we be convey by water in two large canoas to a hospital where as certain of our man be lodge , which be take before the fight at saint John de ullua : we shall have go to our lady hospitali , but that there be also so many of our man take before at that fight that there be no room for we . after our come thither , many of the company that come with i from Panuco die within the space of fourteen day : soon after which time we be take forth from that place , and put altogether into our lady hospitali , in which place we be courteous use , and visit oftentimes by virtuous gentleman and gentlewoman of the city , who bring we diverse thing to comfort we withal , as succat and marmilad , and such other thing , and will also many time give we many thing , and that very liberal . in which hospitali we remain for the 420 space of six month , until we be all whole and sound of body , and then we be appoint by the vice Roy to be carry unto the town of Tescuco , which be from Mexico Southwest distant eight league : in which town there be certain house of correction and punishment for ill people call obrache , like to Bridewell here in London : into which place diverse Indians be sell for slave , some for ten year , and some for twelve . it be no small grief unto we when we understand that we shall be carry thither , and to be use as slave , we have rather be put to death : howbeit there be no remedy , but we be carry to the prison of Tescuco , where we be not put to any labour , but be very strait keep , and almost famish , yet by the good providence of our merciful God , we happen there to meet with one Robert sweet - Robert ing , who be the son of a Englishman bear of a fete a spanish woman : this man can speak very good Eng - * lish , and by his mean we be help very much with victual from the Indians , as mutton , hen , and bread . and if we have not
