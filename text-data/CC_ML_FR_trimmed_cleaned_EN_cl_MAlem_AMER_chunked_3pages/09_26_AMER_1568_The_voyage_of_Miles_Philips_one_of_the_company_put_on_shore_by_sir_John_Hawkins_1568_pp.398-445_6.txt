twelve day , our captain do oftentimes cause certain to go up into the top of high tree , to see if they can descry any town or place of inhabitant , but they can not perceive any , and use often the same order to climb up into high tree , at the length they descry a 413 great river that fall from the northwest into the main sea , and present after , we hear a harquebus shoot off , which do great encourage we , for thereby we know that we be near to some Christians , and do therefore hope short to find some succour and comfort , and within the space of one hour after , as we travel , we hear a cock crow , which be also no small joy unto we , and so we come to the north side of the river of Panuco , where the Spaniard have certain Salines , at which place it be that the harquebus be shoot off , which before we hear : to which place we go not direct , but miss thereof , we leave it about a bowshot upon our left hand : of this river we drink very greedy , for we have not meet with any water in six day before , and as we be here by the river side rest our self , and long to come to the place where the cock do crow , and where the harquebus be shoot off , we perceive many Spaniards upon the other side of the river , ride up and down on horseback , and they perceive we , do suppose that we have be of the Indians their border enemy , the Chichimeci : the river be not past half a bow shoot over : and present one of the Spaniard take a indian boat call a Canoa , and so come over , be row by two Indians , and have take the view of we , do present row over back again to the Spaniard , who without any delay make out about the number of twenty horseman , and embark themselves in the canoas , they lead their horse by the reins swim over after they , and be come over to that side of the river where we be , they saddle their horse , and be mount upon they with their lance charge , they come very fierce run at we . our captain Anthony Godard see they come in that order , do persuade we to submit and yield our self unto they , for be naked , as we at this time be , and without weapon , we can not make any resistance , who bid we obey , and upon the yield of our self , they perceive we to be Christians , and do call for moor canoas , and carry we over by four 414 1568 . and four in a boat , and be come on the other side , they understand by our captain how long we have be without meat , impart between two and two a loaf of bread make of that country wheat , which the Spaniard call maiz , of the bigness of our halfpenny loaf , which bread be name in the indian tongue clashacal . this bread be very sweet and pleasant unto we , for we have not eat any in a long time before : and what be it that hunger do not make to have a savoury and a delicate taste ? and have thus part the bread among we , those which be man they send afore to the town , have also many Indians inhabitant of that place to guard they : they which be young , as boy , and some such also as be feeble , they take up upon their horse , behind they , and so carry we to the town where they dwell , which be very near distant a mile from the place where we come over . this town be well situate , and well replenish with all kind of fruit , as orange , lemon , pomegranate , apricok , and peach , and sundry other , and be inhabit with a great number of tame Indians , or Mexicans , and have in it also at that time about the number of two hundred Spaniard , man , woman , and child , beside negro . of their Salines , which lie the Salines upon the west side of the river , more than a mile distant Â° fpan ^ o - from thence , they make a great profit , for it be a excellent good merchandise there : the Indians do buy much thereof , and carry it up into the country , and there sell it to their own country people , in double the price . also much of the salt make in this place , be transport from thence by sea to sundry other place , as to Cuba , saint John de ullua , and the other port of Tamiago , and Tamachos , which be two bar haven west and by south above threescore league from saint John de ullua . when we be all come to the town , the governor there show himself very severe unto we , and threaten to hang we all : and then he demand what money we have , which in truth be very little , for the Indians which 415 we first meet withal , have in a manner take all from we , and of that which they leave , the Spaniard which bring we over , take away a good part also : howbeit , from Anthony Godard the governor here have a chain of gold , which be give unto he at Carthagena , by the governor there , and from other he have some small store of money : so that we account that among we all he have the number of five hundred pezo , beside the chain of gold . and have thus satisfy himself , when he have take all that we have , he cause we to be put into a little house much like a hogsty , where we be almost smother : and before we be thus shut up into that little coat , they give we some of the country wheat , call Mayz , sodden , which
