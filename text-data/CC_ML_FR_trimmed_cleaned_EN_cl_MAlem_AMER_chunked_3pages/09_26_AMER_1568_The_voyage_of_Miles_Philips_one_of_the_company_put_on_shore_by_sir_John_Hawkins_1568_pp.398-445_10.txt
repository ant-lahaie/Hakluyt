very much against the mind of many of the Spaniard themselves : for never until this time since their first conquer and plant in the Indies , be they subject to that bloody and cruel inquisition . the chief inquisitor be name don Pedro Moya de Contreres , and John de Bovilla his companion , and John Sanches the fischall , and Pedro de los Rios , the secretary : they be come and settle , and place in a very fair house near unto the white friar , consider with themselves that they must make a entrance and beginning of that their most detestable inquisition here in Mexico , to the terror of the whole country , think it best to call we that be Englishman first in question , and so much the rather , for that they have perfect knowledge and intelligence that many of we be become very rich , as have be already declare , and therefore we be a very good booty and pray to the inquisitor : so that now again begin our sorrow a fresh , for we be send for , and seek out in all place of the country , and proclamation make upon pain of loose of good and excommunication , that no man shall hide or keep secret any Englishmen or any part of their good . by mean whereof we be all soon apprehend in all place , and all our good seize and take for the inquisitor use , and so from all part of the country we be convey and send as prisoner to the city of Mexico , and there commit to prison in sundry dark dungeon , where we can not see but by candle light , and be never past two together in one place , so 424 that we see not one another , neither can one of we tell what be become of another . thus we remain close imprison for the space of a year and a half , and other for some less time , for they come to prison ever as they be apprehend . during which time of our imprisonment , at the first beginning we be often call before the inquisitor alone , and there severe examine of our faith , and command to say the pater noster , the have maria , and the creed in latin , which God know a great number of we can not say , otherwise then in the english tongue . and have the say Robert sweat who be our friend at Tescuco always present with they for a interpreter , he make report for we , y * in our own country speech we can say they perfect , although not word for word as they be in latin . then do they proceed to demand of we upon our oath what we do believe of the sacrament , and whether there do remain any bread or wine after the word of consecration , yea or no , and whether we do not believe that the host of bread which the priest do hold up over his head , and the wine that be in the chalice , be the very true and perfect body and blood of our saviour Christ , yea or no : to which if we answer not yea , then be there no way but death . than they will demand of we what we do remember of our self , what opinion we have hold , or have be teach to hold contrary to the same while we be in England : to which we for the safety of our life be constrain to say , that we never do believe , nor have be teach otherwise then have before we have say . then will they charge we that we do not tell they the truth , that they know the contrary , and therefore we shall call our self to remembrance , and make they a better answer at the next time , or else we shall be rack , and make to confess the truth whether we will or no . and so come again before they the next time , we be still demand of our belief while we 425 A . D . 1575 - be in England , and how we have be teach , and also what we think or do know of such of our own company as they do name unto we , so that we can never be free from such demand , and at other time they will promise we , that if we will tell they truth , then shall we have favour and be set at liberty , although we very well know their fair speech be but mean to entrap we , to the hazard and loss of our life : howbeit God so merciful wrought for we by a secret mean that we have , that we keep we still to our first answer , and will still say that we have tell the truth unto they , and know no more by our self nor any other of our fellow then as we have declare , and that for our sin and offence in England against God and our lady , or any of his bless saint , we be hearty sorry for the same , and do cry God mercy , and beseech the inquisitor for God sake , consider that we come into those country by force of weather , and against our will , and that never in all our life we have either speak or do any thing contrary to their law , and therefore they will have mercy upon we . yet all this will not serve ; for still from time to time we be call upon to confess , and about the space of 3 month before they proceed our man be to their severe judgement , we be all rack , and some cruel rack . enforce to utter that against themselves , which afterward cost they their life . and thus have get from our own mouth matter sufficient for they to proceed in judgement against we , they cause a large scaffold to be make in the midst of the market place in Mexico right over against the head church , and 14 or 15 day before the day of their judgement , with the sound of a trumpet , and the noise of
