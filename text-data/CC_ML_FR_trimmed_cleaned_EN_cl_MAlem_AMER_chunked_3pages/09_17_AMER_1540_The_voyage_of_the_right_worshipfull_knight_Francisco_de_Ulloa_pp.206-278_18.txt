on that side where we ankor , we find high and close mountain , with heap of a certain earth which be all ash and burn , and in other place scorch and as black as coal , and like the rust of iron , and in other place whitish , and here and there small black hill , whereat we marvel exceed , consider that when we pass by , it seem unto we a habitable country full of tree , and now we see not a stick grow on this side . all of we suppose that on the other side towards the firm land the tree grow which we see , although ( as i have say ) we sail four or five league distant from the same . we stay here under the shelter of these mountain Saturday , Sunday , and Monday , always have the northern wind so strong , that we think if it have catch we in the sea , we shall have be cast away . Chap . 12 . they environ and land upon the hand of cedar , to discover the same , and to seek water and wood . they be assail of the Indians , and many of they wound with stone : but at length get the upper hand , they go to their cottage , and range far up into the island they find diverse thing which the Indians in their flight have leave behind they . on Friday the 13 of January the captain command we to hoist out our boat , and to go on shore , which be do accord , and we do row along the shore for the space of a good half league and 255 enter into a valley : for ( as i say ) all this country be full of high and bare hill , of such quality as i mention before : and in this and other small valley we find some water which be brackish , and not far from thence certain cottage make of shrub like unto broom ; likewise we find the footing of Indians both small and great , whereat we much marvel that in so rough and wild a country ( as far as we can discern ) there shall be people . here we stay all day , make four or five pit to take in water which we want , which though it be bad , and in small quantity we refuse not ; and so the evening be come , we return to our boat , and so come unto our ship which ride a good league from the shore . the next day be Wednesday the fourteenth of the say month our general command we to set sail , and we sail about the say hand on the same side which we coast when we come from Nueva Espanna : for when we arrive on the coast we see five or six fire ; wherefore he desire to see and learn whether it be inhabit ; and at the far end of this inlet or bay where we ride there come out before we a Canoa , wherein be four indian which come row with certain small oar , and come very near we to see what we be : whereupon we tell our general , that it be best to send some of we out with our boat to take these Indians or some one of they to give they something that they may think we to be good people : but he will not consent thereto , because he mind not to stay , have then a pretty gale of wind , whereby he may sail about this hand , hope that afterward we may find and take some other to speak with they , and give they what we will to carry on shore ; and as we sail near the land , we see a great hill full of goodly tree of the bigness of the tree and cypress of Castille . we find in this hand the foot of wild beast and cony , and see a piece of pine tree - wood , whereof we gather , that there be store 256 of they in that country . thus sail near unto the shore , we see another Canoa come towards we with other four Indians , but it come not very near we , and as we look forward , we see towards a point which be very near before we , three other canoas , one at the head of the point among certain flatte , and the other two moor into the sea , that they may descry we without come over near we . likewise between certain hill which be near the point , there appear here three and there four of they , and afterward we see a small troop of some twenty of they together , so that all of we rejoice great to behold they . on this side the land show green with piece of plain ground which be near the sea , and likewise all those coast of hill show green , and be cover with many tree , although they grow not very thick together . here at evening we ride near the shore hard upon the say point , to see if we can speak with those Indians , and likewise to see if we can get fresh water , which now we want , and still as soon as we be come to a anchor , we see the indian show themselves on land come likewise to in a Canoa , by six and seven at a time , whereat we marvel , because we never think that one of those canoas will hold so many man . in this wise we stay look still what will be the success , and in the place where we ride we be two small league distant from the shore , where we find these Indians in their canoas : whereupon we marvel not a little to see so great a alteration in so small a distance of country , as well because we still discover pleasant land with tree ( whereas on the other side of the isle there be none ) as also because it be so well people with Indians , which have so many canoas mad of wood , as we may discern , and not raft or Balsas , for so they Balsa be a call those float which be make all flat
