they pass the frontier , be environ on all side , and the people set the long dry grass on fire , smother they , so as they have no breath to fight , nor can discern their enemy for the great smoke . he tell i far that 4 day journey from his town be Macureguarai , and that those be the next and near of the subject of Inga , and of the 410 Epuremei , and the first town of apparel and rich people , and that all those plate of gold which be scatter among the borderer and carry to other nation far and near , come from the say Macureguarai and be there make , but that those of the land within be far fine , and be fashion after the image of man , beast , bird , and fish . i ask he whether he think that those company that i have there with i , be sufficient to take that town or no ? he tell i that he think they be . i then ask he , whether he will assist i with guide , and some company of his people to joy ne with we ? he answer that he will go himself with all the borderer , if the river do remain fordable , upon this condition that i will leave with he till my return again fifty soldier , which he undertake to victuali : i answer that i have not above fifty good man in all there , the rest be labourer and rower , and that i have not pro - . vision to leave with they of powder , shot , apparel , or ought else , and that without those thing necessary for their defence , they shall be in danger of the Spaniard in my absence , who i know will use the same measure towards i , that i offer they at Trinidad : and although upon the motion captain Calfield , captain green vile , my nephew John Gilbert and diverse other be desirous to stay , yet i be resolve that they must needs have perish , for Berreo expect daily a supply out of Spain , and look also hourly for his son to come down from Nuevo reyno de Granada , with many horse and foot , and have also in Valencia in the Caracas , two hundred horse ready to march , and i can not have spare above forty , and have not any store at all of powder , lead , or match to have leave with they , nor any other provision , either spade , pickeaxe , or ought else to have fortify withal . when i have give he reason that i can not at this time leave he such a company , he then desire i to forbear he and his country for that time , for he 411 assure i that i shall be no soon three day from the coast , but those Epuremei will invade he , and destroy all the remain of his people and friend , if he shall any way either guide we or assist we against they . he further allege , that the Spaniard seek his death , and as they have already murder his nephew morequito lord of that province , so they have he seventeen day in a chain before he be king of the country , and lead he like a dog from place to place , until he have pay a hundred plate of gold , and diverse chain of spleen - stone for his ransom : and now since he become owner of that province , that they have many time lay wait to take he , and that they will be now more vehement , when they shall understand of his conference with the english , and because , say he , they will the better displant i , if they can lay hand on i , they have get a nephew of i call Eparacano , who they have christen don Juan , and his son don Pedro , who they have also apparel and arm , by who they seek to make a party against i in my own country : he also have take to wife one Loviana of a strong family , which be borderer and neighbour , and my self now be old and in the hand of death be not able to travel nor to shift , as when i be of young year : he therefore pray we to defer it till the next year , when he will undertake to draw in all the borderer to serve we , and then also it will be more seasonable to travel , for at this time of the year , we shall not be able to pass any river , the water be and will be so grow ere our return . he far tell i , that i can not desire so much to invade Macureguari , and the rest of Guiana , but that the borderer will be more vehement than i , for he yield for a chief cause that in the war with the Epuremei , they be spoil of their woman , and that their wife and daughter be take from they , so as for their own part they desire nothing of the gold 412 or treasure , for their labour , but only to recover woman from the Epuremei : for he far complain very sad ( as it have be a matter of great consequence ) that whereas they be wont to have ten or twelve wife , they be now enforce to content themselves with three or four , and that the lord of the Epuremei have fifty or a hundred : and in truth they war more for woman then either for gold or dominion : for the lord of country desire many child of their own body , to increase their race and kindred , for in those consist their great trust and strength . diverse of his follower afterward desire i to make haste again , that they may sack the Epuremei , and i ask they of what ?
