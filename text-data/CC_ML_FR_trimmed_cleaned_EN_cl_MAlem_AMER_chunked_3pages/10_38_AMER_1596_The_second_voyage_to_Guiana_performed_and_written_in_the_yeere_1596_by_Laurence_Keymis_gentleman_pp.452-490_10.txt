and by east , take the direct course to shorten our way homeward . thus have i empty your purse , spend my time and travel in follow your lordship direction for the full discovery of this coast , and the river thereof . concern they not make of a voyage for your private profit , i pretend nothing . sorry i be , that where i seek no excuse , by the Spaniard be there i find my defect remediless . and for my own part , i do protest , that if the consideration of the public good that may ensue , have not overpoise all other hope and desire : i will rather have adventure by such small and weak mean as i have , to do well with danger , than to return only with safety . now although in a cause not doubtful , my allegation be no way needful : yet because the weightiness thereof , and the expectation of other , seem of due and right to claim something to be say by i , who your especial trust and favour have credit and grace with this employment : pardon it ( i beseech your honour ) if , where my lamp have oil , it borrow light also ; and my speech , which be altogether unsavoury , season it self with some of the leaven of your own discourse touch this discovery . the particular relation of some certain thing i have reserve as proper belong to your self , who only , as know most , can make best use thereof . so much in general be here touch , as ( i hope ) may serve to refresh the memory of this worthy enterprise in those 479 who it may concern , and testify your care and expense in follow the same : that in a second age , when in time truth shall have credit , and man wonder at the riches , and strength of this place ( which nature it self have marvelous fortify , as her chief treasurehouse ) shall mourn and sigh to hold idle cicle , while other reap and gather in this harvest , it be not say , that sir Walter Ralegh be of all man live in his day , most industrious in seek , most fortunate in attain to the fullness of a inestimable public good : if , know that for envy and private respect , his labour be lessen , his information mistrust , his proffer not regard , and the due honour of his desert impart to other : if ( i say ) see , know and bear all this , he with patience have persist in so good a way in do he princess , and country service ; and have but perfect his first discovery by send a ship or two for that purpose : for then sure all let and doubt be removed , and so large a kingdom , so exceed rich , so plentiful of all thing , as this by his discourse appear to be , be offer : no devise and vain surmise can have take place , no illusion can have prevail : it have be blindness and deafness in those , that be near her majesty do spend their day in serve the common weal , not to see , and know in so weighty a matter : it have be malicious obstinacy , impotency of mind , and more than treason to the common wealth , the matter stand only upon acceptance , to seek either to foreslow so fit a occasion , or forsake so general a blessing . this ( if ) be now cut off through a singular and incomparable temper , in overcome evile with good . this your second discovery have not only find a free and open entrance into Raleana , which the natural call Orenoque : but moreover yield choice of fourty several great river ( the lesser i do not reckon ) be for the most part with small vessel navigable for our merchant and other , that do now find little profit in set forth for reprisal , to exercise trade in . to such as shall be willing to adventure in search of they , i can propose some hope of gold mine , and certain assurance of piece of make gold , of spleen - stone , kidney - stone , and other of better estimate . but because our belief seem to be mate in these great matter , and a certainty of small profit be the ready inducement to quicken our weak hope ; i not go so far as i own eye may warrant i , do only promise in the aforesaid river brasil - wood , honey , cotton , balsamum , and drug to help to defray charge : and further , because without a begin there can be no continuance of these benefit unto our country to any that shall be the first undertaker hereof , i be glad content to give such light and knowledge , as by conference with the Indians i have attain unto . my self , and the remain of my few year , i have bequeathe whole to Raleana , and all my thought live only in that action . the prosecute whereof be in it self just , profitable , and necessary . just , because it be intend for the defence of harmless people , who fear thralldome and oppression , desire to protect themselves and their country under her majesty tuition : profitable , as may be gather not only by many spanish letter intercept , but also by the proof mention in the discourse of the first discovery , and since that , by the Indians own voluntary relation : and last , by the provision that the Spaniard do make to acquit we thereof . necessary it be , as be the only help to put a bit in the mouth of the unbridle Spaniard ; the only way to enter into his treasury of Nuevo Reyno , and Peru ; the only mean to animate the wrong Indians with our assistance to seek revenge for the extreme murder and cruelty , which they have endure , and to ruinate his â€¢ naked city in all those part of the inland ; who foundation have be lay in the blood of their parent and ancestor . the force that the Spaniard have already send to ten 481
