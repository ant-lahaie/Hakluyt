and return the same way back again unto the shore with much ado , and come to a anchor a great way short of the place from whence we be drive : and there we ride until Thursday at noon with this bitter north wind , and on Friday about noon , when we most think it will have cease , it begin to increase again , which grieve we not a little see the weather so contrary , hope always that it will cease , and that some wind will blow from the shore , whereby 233 we may recover the point of land to take in fresh water , and to search whether there be any people about that lake . here we lay from the 26 of the say month till the 29 , drive up and down the sea , wind in by little and little until we have get under the shelter of those mountain : which be obtain we ride the say 29 of the month half a league from those woody mountain , which we have see in the sea we stay in this place at our ease all the Sunday , and Juan Castilio the chief pilot go that day in the boat on shore with seven in his company , and they land near the sea , and on a certain low ground they find four or five Indians Chichimecas of great stature , and go towards they , who flee away like deer that have be chase . after this the pilot go a little way along the seashore , and then return to his boat , and by that time he be enter thereinto , he see about fifteen Indians of great stature also , with their bow and arrow which call unto he with a loud and strong voice , make sign with their bow ; but the pilot make no account of their gesture , but rather return to the ship , and declare what have pass between he and the Indians . the same day the captain command that our cask shall be make ready against the next morning to take in water , for in both the ship there be about five and twenty buttes empty . the first of December , and the second day in the morning the captain go with both the bark on shore with some dozen soldier , and the great part of the mariner which labour in fill of water , leave in the ship as many as be needful , and as soon as we be come on shore at the water place the captain cause the buttes to be take out , to the end they may be fill with water , and while they return to fetch the barrel and hogshead of the ship , the captain walk a turn or two upon the shore for the space of one or two crossbow shoot , and afterward we go up to certain of those 234 mountain , to view the disposition of the country , and in truth we find it in that place very bad to our judgement , for it be very ragged , full of wood and cave , and so stony , that we have much ado to go . be come unto the top we find certain small hill full of wood , and cliff that be not so craggy , although very troublesome to climb up ; and while we look from these little hill , we can not discern any more mountain , but rather judge that from that place forward there be great plain . the captain will not suffer we to go any further , because in those place we have see certain Indians which seem to be spy , and warn we thereof he command we to retire unto the shore , where we be to take in water , and to dispatch our business quick , and appoint we to make certain pit , that our butt may more easy be fill with water . And set our guard or centinel , we begin to fill water . in the mean while the captain take certain soldier , and go to the top of a high hill , from whence he descry a great part of the sea , and a lake which be within the land : for the sea enter in the space of a league , and there be a good fish place round about : and the lake be a fishingplace so great , that it seem unto we to be very near 30 ° f league in compass , for we can not discern the end thereof . than we come down with no less trouble ’ than we have mount up unto the hill , by reason of the steepenesse of the place , and some tumble down with no small laughter of the rest .
