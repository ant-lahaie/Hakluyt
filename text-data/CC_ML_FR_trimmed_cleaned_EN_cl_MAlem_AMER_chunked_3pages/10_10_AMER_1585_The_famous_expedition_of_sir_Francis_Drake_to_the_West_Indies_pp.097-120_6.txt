countenance in some smile sort , without answer any thing , as great ashamed thereof . for by some of our company it be tell they , that if the queen of England will resolute prosecute the war against the king of Spain , he shall be force to lay aside that proud and unreasonable reach vain of his : for he shall find more then enough to do to keep that which he have already , as by the present example of their lose town they may for a beginning perceive well enough . now to the satisfy of some man , who marvel great that such a famous and goodly build city so well inhabit of gallant people , very brave in their apparel ( whereof our soldier find good store for their relief ) shall afford no great riches then be find there : herein it be to be understand that the indian people , which be the natural of this whole island of Hispaniola ( the same be near hand as great as England ) be many year since clean consume by the tyrannic of the Spaniard , which be the cause , that for lack of people to work in the mine , the gold and silver mine of this island be whole give over , and thereby they be fain in this island to use copper money , whereof be find very great quantity . the chief trade of this place consist of sugar and ginger , which grow in the island , and of hide of ox and cow , which in this waste country of the island be breed in infinite number , the soil be very fertile : and the say beast be feed up to a very large growth , and so kill for nothing so much , as for their hide aforesaid . we find here great store of strong wine , sweet oil , vinegar , olive , and other such like provision , as excellent wheat - meal pack up in winepipe and other cask , and other commodity likewise , as woollen and linen cloth , and some silk : all which provision be bring out of Spain , and serve we for ‚Äù 5 great relief . there be but a little plate or vessel of silver , in comparison of the great pride in other thing of this town , because in these hot country they use much of those earthen dish fine paint or varnish , which they call Porcellana , which be have out of the east India : and for their drink , they use glass altogether , whereof they make excellent good and fair in the same place . but yet some plate we find , and many other good thing , as their household garniture very gallant and rich , which have cost they dear , although unto we they be of small importance . from saint Domingo we put over to the main or firm land , and go all alongst the coast , we come at Cartagena , the last in sight of Cartagena , stand upon the sea side , so near , as some of our bark in pass alongst , approach within the reach of their culverin shoot , which they have plant upon certain platform . the harbour mouth lay some three mile towards the westward of the town , whereinto we enter about three or four of the clock in the afternoon without any resistance of ordinance , or other impeachment plant upon the same . in the evening we put our self on land towards the harbour mouth , under the lead of master Carliell our lieutenant general , who after he have digest we to march forward about midnight , as easy as foot may fall , express command we to keep close by the sea - wash of the shore for our best and sure way , whereby we be like to go through , and not to miss any more of the way , which once we have lose within a hour after our first beginning to march , through the slender knowledge of he that take upon he to be our guide , whereby the night spend on , which otherwise must have be do by rest . but as we come within some two mile of the town , their horseman which be some hundred , meet we , and take the alarm , retire to their townward again upon the first volley of our shot that be give they : for the place where we encounter be 116 woody and bushy even to the water side be unmeet for their service . at this instant we may hear some piece of artillery discharge , with diverse small shot towards the harbour , which give we to understand , accord to the order set down in the evening before by our general , that the viceadmiral accompany with captain Venner , captain white , and captain cross , with other sea captain , and with diverse pinnace and boat shall give some attempt unto the little fort stand on the entry of the inner haven , near adjoin to the town , though to small purpose , for that then be strong , and the entry very narrow be chain over : so as there can be nothing get by the attempt , more than the give of they a alarm on that other side of the haven be a mile and a half from the place we now be at . in which attempt the viceadmiral have the rudder of his skiff strike through with a saker shoot , and a little or no harm receive elsewhere . the troop be now in their march , half a mile behither the town or less , the ground we be on grow to be strait , and not above fifty pace over , have the main sea on the one side of it , and the harbour - water or inner sea ( as you may term it ) on the other side , which in the plot be plain show . This straight be fortify clean over with a stone wall and a ditch without it : the say wall be as orderly build with flank in every part , as can be set down . there be only so much of this strait unwalled , as may serve for the issue of the horseman , or the pass of carriage in time of need : but this unwalled part be not without a very good barricado of wine - but or pipe , fill with earth , full and thick as they may stand on end one by another , some part of they stand even within the main
