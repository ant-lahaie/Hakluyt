. but to give we no suspicion thereof , and the better to cover his intention , he send his messenger oftentimes unto we bring always with they some kind of present . among other one day he send three Indians , which bring we two basket full of great pumpion , much more excellent than those which we have in France , and promise i in their king behalf , that during my abode in that country , i shall never want victual : i thank they for their king good will , and signify unto they the great desire which i have , aswell for the benefit of Satourioua , as for the quiet of his subject , to make a peace between he and those of Thimogoa : which thing can not choose but turn to their great benefit , see that be ally with the king of those part , he have a open passage against onatheaqua his ancient enemy , which otherwise he can not set upon . Moreover that Olata ouae utina be so mighty a Paracoussy , that Satourioua be not able to withstand his force : but be agree together they may easy overthrow all their enemy , and may pass the confine of the far river that be towards the south . the messenger pray i to have patience until the morrow , 30 at what time they will come again unto i to certify i of their lord inclination : which they fail not to do , advertise i that Paracoussy Satourioua be the glad man in the world to treat of this accord ( although indeed he be quite contrary ) and that he beseech i to be diligent therein , promise to observe and perform whatsoever i shall agree upon with those of Thimogoa : which thing the messenger also rehearse unto the prisoner which i have lead away . after they be depart , i resolve within two day to send back again the prisoner to Olata ouae utina , who subject they be : but before i embark they , i give they certain small trifle , which be little knife or tablet of glass , wherein the image of king Charles the nine be draw very lively , for which they give i very great thanks , as also for the honest entertainment which be give they at the fort Caroline . after this they embark themselves , with captain Vasseur , and with monsieur de Arlac my ensign , which i have send of purpose to remain a certain time with ouae utina , hope that the favour of this great Paracoussy will serve my turn great to make my discovery in time to come . i send with he also one of my sergeant , and six gallant soldier . thus thing pass on this manner , and the hatred of Paracoussy Satourioua against i do still continue , until that on the nine and twenty of August a lightning [ he . 331 . i from heaven fall within half a league of our fort , - awanderfm more worthy i believe to be wonder at , and to be ofjugut put in writing , than all the strange sign which have be see in time past , and whereof the history have never write . for although the meadow be at that season all green , and half cover over with water , nevertheless the lightning in one instant consume above five hundred acre therewith , and burn with the ardent heat thereof all the fowl which take their pastime in the meadow , which thing continue for three day space , which cause we not a little to muse , not be able to judge whereof this fire proceed : for one while we think that the Indians have burn their house , and abandon their place for fear of we : another while we think that they have discover some ship in the sea , and that accord to their custom they have kindle many fire here and there , to signify that their country be inhabit : nevertheless be not assure , KingSar - i determine to send to Paracoussy Serrany to know ranay . the truth thereof . but even as i be upon the point to send one by boat to discover the matter , six Indians king Allima - come unto i from Paracoussy Allimacany , which at can3 ' their first entry make unto i a long discourse , and a very large and ample oration ( after they have present i with certain basket full of Maiz , of pompion and of grape ) of the love amity which Allimacany desire to continue with i , and that he look from day to day when it will please i to employ he in my service . therefore consider the serviceable affection that he bear unto i , he find it very strange , that i the savage thus discharge my ordinance against his dwell , â€˜ lightning to be and burn up a infinite sight of green meadow , discharge of and consume even down unto the bottom of the the christian water , and come so near unto his mansion , that he ordinance . think he see the fire in his house : wherefore he beseech i most humble to command my man that they will not shoot any more towards his lodging , otherwise that hereafter he shall be constrain to abandon his country , and to retire himself into some place further off from we . have understand the foolish opinion of this man , which notwithstanding can not choose but be very profitable for we , i dissemble what i think thereof for that time , and answer the indian with a cheerful countenance , that the relation which they make unto i of the obedience of their Paracoussy do please i right well , because that before he have not behave himself in such sort towards i , especial when i summon he to send i the prisoner of great Olata ouae utina which he detain , whereof notwithstanding he make no great account , which be the principali cause wherefore i have discharge my ordinance against he : not that i mean to reach unto his house ( as i may have do easy , if it have please i ) but that i be content to shoot the half way to make he know my force : assure
