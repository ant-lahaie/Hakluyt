begin to draw near their zenith , which may be ( as before ) about the eleven day of May , and then begin to send his beam almost at right angle , about which time the sun enter into the first degree of gemini , and with this almost right angle the sun beam will continue until it be past cancer , that be , the space of two month every day at noon , almost perpendicular over their head , be then the time of solstitium Aestivale : which so long continuance of the sun about their zenith may cause a extreme heat ( if any be in the world ) but of necessity far more heat than can be under the equinoctial , where the sun have not such long abode in the zenith , but pass away therehence very quick . also under the tropicke , the day be long by a hour and a half , than it be under the equinoctial ; wherefore the heat of the sun have a long time of operation , must needs be increase , 266 especial see the night wherein cold and moisture do abound under the tropicke , be less than it be under the equinoctial . therefore i gather , that under the tropicke be the hot place , not only of torrida zona , but of any other part of the world , especial because there both cause of heat do concur , that be , the perpendicular fall of the sun beam two month together , and the long abode of the sun presence above the Horison . and by this mean more at large be prove , that Marochus in summer be far more hot , then at any time under the equinoctial , because it be situate so near the Tropic of Cancer , and also for the length of their day . neither yet do i think , that the region situate under the Tropic be not habitable , for they be find to be very fruitful also ; although Marochus and some other part of Africa near the Tropike for the dryness of the native sandy soil , and some accident may seem to some to be intemperate for over much heat . for Ferdinandus Oviedus speak of Cuba and Hispaniola , hand of America , lie hard Cuba . under , or by the Tropike of Cancer , say , that these htspant ° la - hands have as good pasture for cattle , as any other country in the world . also , they have most wholesome and clear water , and temperate air , by reason whereof the herd of beast be much big , fat , and of better taste , than any in Spain , because of the rank pasture , who moisture be better digest in the herb or grass , by continual ! and temperate heat of the sun , whereby be make more fat and unctious , it be of better and more steadfast nourishment : for continual and temperate heat do not only draw much moisture out of the earth to the nourishment of such thing as grow , and be engender in that climb , but do also by moderation preserve the same from putrify , digest also , and condensate or thicken the say moist nourishment into a gum and ■ unctious substance , whereby appear also , that under moderat ' tem the tropike be both wholesome , fruitful , and pleasant perature . 267 habitation , whereby last it follow , that all the middle zone , which until of late day have be count and call the burn , broil , and parch zone , be now find to be the most delicate , temperate , commodious , pleasant , and delectable part of the world , and especial under the equinoctial . have now sufficient at large declare the temperature of the middle zone , it remain to speak somewhat also of the moderate and continual heat in cold region , as well in the night as in the day all the summer long , and also how these region be habitable to the inhabitant of the same , contrary to the opinion of the old writer . of the temperature of cold region all the summer long , and also how in winter the same be habitable , especial to the inhabitant thereof . he cold region of the world be those , which tend towards the pole arctike , and antarctike , be without the circuit or bound of the seven climate : which assertion agreeable to the opinion of the old writer , be find and set out in our author of the sphere , Johannes de nine climate . Sacrobosco , where he plain say , that without the seven climate , which be bound by a parallel pass at fifty degree in latitude , all the habitation beyond be discommodious and intolerable . but gemma Frisius a late writer find England and Scotland to be without the compass of those climate , wherein he know to be very temperate and good habitation , add thereunto two other climate , the uttermost parallel whereof pass by 56 . degree in latitude , and therein com - prehendeth over and above the first computation , England , Scotland , Denmark , Moscovia , etc which all be rich and mighty kingdom . 268 the old writer persuade by bare conjecture , go about to determine of those place , by compare they to their own complexion , because they feel they to be hardly tolerable to themselves , and so take thereby a argument of the whole habitable earth ; as if a man bear in Marochus , or some other part of Barbary , comparison shall at the latter end of summer upon the sudden , either naked , or with his thin vesture , be bring into England , he will judge this region present not to be habitable , because he be bring up in so warm a country , be not able here to live , for so sudden a alteration of the cold air : but if the same man have come at the begin of summer , and so afterward by little and little by certain degree , have feel and acquaint himself with the frost of autumn , it will have seem by degree to harden he , and so to make
