a resolution of the land - captain , what course they think most expedient to be take . give at Cartagena the xxvij . of February 1585 . Hereas it have please the general to demand the opinion of his captain what course they think most expedient to be now undertake , the land - captain be assemble by themselves together , and have advise hereupon , do in three point deliver the same . the first , touch the keep of the town against the force of the enemy , either that which be present , or that which may come out of Spain , be answer thus . we hold opinion , that with this troop of man which we have present with we in land - service , be victual and munition , we may well keep the town , albeit that of man able to answer present service , we have not above 700 . the residue be some 150 . man by reason of their hurt and sickness be altogether unable to stand we in any stead : wherefore hereupon the sea - captaine be likewise to give their resolution , how they will undertake the safety and service of the ship upon the arrival of any spanish fleet . the second point we make to be this , whether it be meet to go present homeward , or else to continue further trial of our fortune in undertake such like enterprise as we have do already , and thereby to seek after that bountiful mass of treasure for recompense of our travail , which be general expect at our come forth of England : wherein we answer . that it be well know how both we and the soldier be enter into this action as voluntary man , without any impress or gage from her majesty or any body else : 121 and forasmuch as we have hitherto discharge the part of honest man , so that now by the great blessing and favour of our good god there have be take three such notable town , wherein by the estimation of all man will have be find some very great treasure , know that S . Iago be the chief city of all the island and traffic thereabouts , saint Domingo the chief city of Hispaniola , and the head government not only of that hand , but also of Cuba , and of all the hand about it , as also of such inhabitation of the firm land , as be next unto it , and a place that be both magnificent build , and entertain great trade of merchandise ; and now last the city of Cartagena , which can be deny to be one of the chief place of most especial importance to the Spaniard of all the city which be on this side of the west India : we do therefore consider , that since all these city , with their good and prisoner take in they , and the ransom of the say city be all put together , be find far short to satisfy that expectation which by the generality of the enterpriser be first conceive : and be further advise of the slenderness of our strength , whereunto we be now reduce , as well in respect of the small number of able body , as also not a little in regard of the slack disposition of the great part of those which remain , very many of the better mind and man be either consume by death , or weaken by sickness and . hurt : and last , since that as yet there be not lay down to our knowledge any such enterprise as may seem convenient to be undertake with such few as we be present able to make , and withal of such certain likelihood , as with God good success which it may please he to bestow upon we , the same may promise to yield we any sufficient contentment : we do therefore conclude hereupon , that it be better to hold sure as we may the honour already get , and with the same to return towards our gracious sovereign and country , from whence if it shall please her majesty to set we forth again with her orderly mean and entertainment , we be most ready and willing 122 to go through with any thing that the uttermost of our strength and endeavour shall be able to reach unto ; but therewithal we do advise and protest that it be far from our thought , either to refuse , or so much as to seem to be weary of any thing , which for the present shall | be further require or direct to be do by we from our general . the three and last point be concern the ransom of this city of Cartagena , for the which , before it be touch with any fire , there be make a offer of some xxvij . or xxviij . thousand pound sterling . thus much we utter herein as our opinion agree ( so it be do in good sort ) to accept this offer aforesaid , rather than to break off by stand still upon our demand of one hundred thousand pound , which seem a matter impossible to be perform for the present by they , and to say truth , we may now with much honour and reputation better be satisfy with that sum offer by they at the first ( if they will now be content to give it ) then we may at that time with a great deal more , inasmuch as we have take our full pleasure both in the uttermost sack and spoil of all their household good and merchandise , as also in that we have consume and ruin a great part of their town with fire . and thus much further be consider herein by we , that as there be in the voyage a great many poor man , who have willing adventure their life and travail , and diverse among they have spend their apparel and such other little provision as their small mean may have give they leave to prepare , which be do upon such good and allowable intention as this action have always carry with it , meaning , against the Spaniard our great and most dangerous enemy :
