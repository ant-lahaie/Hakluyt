D . I575 - a skirmish between the english man , and . the Spaniard . it from the Spaniard , and the negro promise to help he with their bow and arrow , and thereupon they come to seek the Spaniard , and now that some of his company be kill and take , he think it best to return to his ship , and to pass back for England . the spanish captain hear this , have bury the dead body , and have get all thing into his bark , and take the english man and their pinnace with he , he return to Panama : so the voyage of that english man do not prosper with he , as he think it will have do . now when the four bark be come to Panama , they send advise also to number de dios , and they of number de dios send also from they other four bark which ( as the Spaniard say ) find the english ship where she be hide , and bring she to number de dios : and that the viceroy of Peru not think it good to suffer fifty english man to remain in the country , send a servant of his call Diego de Frees , with a hundred and fifty shot into the mountain to seek they out , who find they make of certain canoas to go into the north sea , and there to take some bark or other : some of they be sick , and be take , betray to they and the rest flee with the negro , who in the end Spaniard . ' ' ' . 0 .... - - betray they to the Spaniard , so that they be bring to Panama . and the justice of Panama ask the english captain whether he have the queen licence , or the licence of any other prince or lord for his attempt . and he answer he have none , whereupon he and all his company be condemn to dye , and so be all execute , save the captain , the master , the pilot , and five boy which be carry to Lima , and there the captain be execute with the other two , but the boy be yet live . the king of Spain have intelligence of these matter , send 300 man of war against those negro which have assist those english man , which before be slave unto the Spaniard , and as before be say , 80 ! 575 - fled from their master unto those mountain , and so join themselves to the Englishman , to the end they may the better revenge themselves on the Spaniard . at the first come of these 300 soldier , they take many of the negro , and execute great justice upon they : but after a season , the negro grow wise and wary , and prevent the Spaniard , so that none of they can be take . the Spaniard of that country marveil much at this one thing , to see that since the conquer of this land , there have be many Frenchmen , that have come to those country , but never see English man there but only those two of who i have speak . and although there have many Frenchmen be on the coast , yet never dare they put foot upon land , only those two english man adventure it , and do such exploit , as be before remember . all these thing come to the hear of the the english king of Spain , he provide two galley well appoint to keep those coast : and the first year they take â€™ six or seven french ship . and after that this be king of Spain know , there be no more Englishman or Frenchman to build galley of war that dare adventure to approach the coast , then until this present year 1586 , that the aforesaid Francis ' Drake , with a strong fleet of 24 ship arrive there , and make spoil of Santo Domingo , Carthagena , and saint Augustine , thing that be know to all the world . but it be likely that if the king of Spain live , he will in time provide sufficient remedy , to keep his country and subject from the invasion of other nation . ten 81
