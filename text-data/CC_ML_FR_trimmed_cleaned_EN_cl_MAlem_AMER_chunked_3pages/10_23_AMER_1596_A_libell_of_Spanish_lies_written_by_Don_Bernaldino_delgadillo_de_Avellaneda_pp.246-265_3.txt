likely they will cast they overboard : but it be more likely , that the general fall into some pleasant dream at sea , wherein he do see a false apparition of victory against the english , and for lack of matter do set this down in his letter for news to his country : it be sin to belie the devil , and therefore the general shall have his right : the letter be so well contrive , and yet with no great eloquence , but with such art , that there be not many more line , than there be lie , which show that there be wonderful and extraordinary gift in the general : but i be persuade if don Bernaldino have think that his letter shall have be print , he will have omit many thing contain in the letter : for the doctor do use he somewhat hardly in show the letter open , and more in suffer it to be print : for friend may like good fellow send lie one to the other for recreation , and feed their friend with some small taste thereof , so it be keep close , without danger to incur the title of a lie general : but as the matter be now handle through the simplicity of the doctor , i can see but the general don Bernaldino be like to carry the title equal betwixt both his shoulder . 256 five , the general do say in his print letter , that notwithstanding all the diligence he can use , he can not cause the english fleet to stay nor come near they , nor discharge one harquebus or piece of artillery , but flee away as fast as they can . a nd this lie also he do not receive by intelligence from any other , but himself be a eyewitness in the action , which make he bold to send this with the rest into his country for current news : but herein don Bernaldino be more bold than wise , for the turn and batter side of his galleon , be compare the tomb side with her majesty ship , and other that serve in of the spanish that fight , do declare , that his ship receive at least two bullet for one . neither can it be conceal but Bernaldino oj he own countryman ( if any do favour truth ) may lie . easy see the loss , and late reparation , do unto the king fleet , since they do encounter with the english navy , whensoever they that remain shall arrive in Spain . but the general seem to be a very good proficient in his profession , and wax somewhat bold , tread the true step of old Bernardino de Mendoza : and yet Mendoza be somewhat more wary in his lie , for he have sometime the colour of intelligence to shadow they : but the general grow from boldness to impudency make no scruple to say , that the english navy flee as fast as they can without discharge any harquebus or piece of artillery , when as the batter side of his ship do return the lie to his face : for in this conflict don Bernaldino do behave himself so valiant , that he be always far off7 in the fight , and have so great care of his own person , that he stand clear from the danger of musket or any small shot , and dare not apprpch ; whereas our the order of general be the foremost , and so hold his place , the english until by order of fight other ship be to have naw . their turn , accord to his former direction : who wise and politic have so order his vangarde , ten 257 r and rearward , that as the manner of it be altogether strange to the Spaniarde , so may they have be without all hope of victory , if their general have be a man of any judgement in sea - fight : i know no reason why the english navy shall fly from he ; the Spaniard for the Spaniarde may put all the gain in his eye that can brag ever he do win from the english : peradventure some of his gain . novice of our country meet the general in Spain , and hear a repetition of so many syllable in one name , as don Bernaldino Delgadillo de Avellaneda , may think they to be word of conjuration , and for fear of raise a spirit , may fly from he as from the devil : or some simple indian slave hear the like repetition of his long and tedious name , may suppose it to be a army of Spaniards , and for fear run away : but the commander and captain of the english navy spanish brag be man of such resolution , that no spanish brag can be of no value dismay they ( for they have often meet they with their ^ ent ^ pike in their spanish beard ) nor the countenance of it don Bernaldino quail they , although he be acowtre in his gild leather buskin , and his Toledo rapier . six the general say in his letter , that notwithstanding their fly away so fast , the english leave they one good ship well man , who tell he that Drake die in number de dios : in which ship be one hundred and forty man , and fifteen noble captain of the best sort . the general don Bernaldino , like a resolute Spaniarde have already go over his shoe , make no danger to wade over his boot also : and as he have begin , so he do conclude . i marvel that he do not in write his discourse remember this old say : that be , a liar ought to have a good memory : it be much better for he in my opinion to revoke the testimony which he say he have from the Englishman , concern sir Francis Drake his death at number de dios , and stand to the intelligence receive from 258 the silly indian slave , as it appear in his first lie : for without all doubt there be no english man that will say ( if he have his right sense ) that he die at number de dios , for they all know the contrary : neither can the general avouch that he receive intelligence from any english man , that after the death of sir Francis drake they do elect for general colonel Quebraran don Bernal - ( as he do most false affirm in the latter end of ra â„¢ his vain and frivolous letter ) see that this name new ^ nd ^ be strange and unknown to any in the english navy . Grange name . neither do i imagine that any of those which the general say he have take , be so forgetful , as not to remember their general name . but without all doubt this addition of so new and strange a name to the english general , do prove that don Bernaldino be not unfurnish of a forge and storehouse of lie , from whence as from a everflow fountain , he send forth
