lie of all sort sufficient for his own store , and great plenty to furnish his friend : the general be much behold to his godfather who give he the name Bernaldino , which we in english do take to be plain Barnard , which name have as it be a kind of privilege from be sharp reprehend , when the party be think to err : for it be a common say among the schoolman that Bernardus non videt omnia , viz . Barnard see not all thing , ( when he do dissent from their opinion ) the which favour we can be content to yield to Bernaldino for the name sake , if he be not take with so many manifest and impudent lie : neither do i think that signior Bernaldino will say , that he see all that he have write , be it speak in council for shame the general : for be there any man so void of reason as to think , that any Englishman be demand of his general name , will write or speak Quebraran for Baskervil . so much difference there be in the sound of the syllable , as there be no affinity at all , or likelihood of truth . but such be the general rare gift , ( be it speak to 259 [ three . 596 . i the schoolman of modesty do use this kind of reprehension , when they do think the author to err . the difference betwixt Quebraran and basker - vill . his small praise ) that we Englishman must of force confess , that the general have give a proud onset to carry the whetstone from signior Bernaldino de Mendoza : neither will the hundred and forty man and fifteen noble captain ( which he say he do take , of who he may have be right inform of their general name ) acquit he of lie forgery , for give the name of Quebraran to the english general . as for the good ship well man , which he say the english leave they after the fight , i be persuade he have no man to witness that lie , for the ship be separate by weather from the english fleet in the night , thirteen day before the fight with the spanish navy , and never to any man knowledge come more in sight the general of the english fleet . if the spanish ship by chance make great do take the say well man ship ( as they call she ) ^ “ di ^ si ^ 1 doubt not but they have the ship , the hundred and ship which be forty man , and the fifteen noble captain to show : suppose not to but evermore i guess the spanish reckon will fall strike one short when it be examine , for the fifteen noble Capi noble ta ' ne prove , ( as i take it ) but three , who loss captain ™ ‘ i grieve to think on : neither do the Spaniard gain contrary to the they by valour , or we loose or leave they for cowgeneral lie ardise , as most untrue this brag liar have certify . wi ^ rme but ® ut tbe general like a provident man , to make his ‘ ‘ three ™ ** fame and credit the great with his prince and country , take upon he ( among other his miracle perform before the english fleet ) by way of amplification to make small matter seem great , as a little shoe to serve a great foot , and find that it can hardly be bring to pass , he do so stretch the leather with his tooth that it be ready to break : and yet notwithstanding all this will not serve his purpose ; for the print of the letter do mar the play , and bring such matter in question , as the general do wish might be conceal , and be he not of so dry and choleric a complexion , as common Spaniards be , he will blush for very shame in publish so impudent 260 such manifest untruth . for sithence his meeting with the english fleet at the he of Pinos , there have be by the worthy english general a honourable expedition from England into the continent of Spain , where among other exploit have take the city of Cadiz , in the sack thereof be find some of don the first Bernaldino his print letter : which come to the hand of a captai ne that serve in sir Francis drake last voyage to the west Indies , he have think very fit ( in regard of the slander to the english navy contain in the say letter ) to quote the error , that the truth only may appear , to all such as have a desire to be right inform of such accident as befall they in this late voyage to the west Indies : and this may suffice to show don Bernaldino Delgadillo de Avellaneda his great judgement in amplify small matter , or of nothing to make in show somewhat . and now have thus far inform you of the truth in reproof of the slanderous , false , and untrue report of this glorious lie general , with a true disproof to some of the gross of his lie , i will leave he with the rest of his lie letter , and the circumstance therein contain to your censure : who in discretion may easy discern the same : and have here follow plain and true set down the course and order of our whole fight after we meet . the meet of our english navy and the spanish fleet , and the order of our encounter . Unday the first of march , accord to our computation , we descry the hand of Pinos , where hale in for the western part thereof , think there to have water , be within four league off it southerly , we send in three of our pinnace to discover the harbour , and to sound afore we , about one of the clock in the afternoon ; the same day we discover a fleet of twenty 261 the first discovery of the spanish fleet . hie incoimt betwixt the english and the spanish ship . sail , and deem they to be the spanish fleet , we keep our loof to get the wind , but their vice - admiral with diverse other ship go about to cut off our pinnaces : so that our general with some other of our ship , be force to tack about upon the larbourd tack , and so run in towards the land keep the wind , so as we recover our pinnace ; which force the enemy ship to tack about , and to take the aid of their fleet , and be come near unto they they shoot at we ; we still approach , have our close fight up , our flag , ensign and streamer display , our man orderly place in each quarter , but forbear our fight until our general begin , and give we warning to come in and fight , by shoot off " a great piece , accord to his former
