doubt much , whether he himself or any of he yet know the best way into the say empire . tt can therefore hardly be regain , if any strength be former set down , but in one or two place , and but two or three crumster or galley build , and furnish upon the river within : the west Indies have many port , water place , and landing , and near than three hundred mile to Guiana , no man can harbour a ship , except he know one only place , which be not learned in haste , and which i will undertake there be not any one of my company that know , whosoever hearken most after it . beside by keep one good fort , or build one town of strength , the whole empire be guard , and whatsoever company shall be afterwards plant within the land , although in twenty several province , those shall be able all to reunite themselves upon any occasion either by the way of one river , or be able to march by land without either wood , bog , or mountain : whereas in the west Indies there be few town or province that can succour or relieve one the other , either by land or sea : by land the country be either desert , mountainous , or strong enemy : by sea , if any man invade to the eastward , those to the west can in many month turn against the breeze and eastern wind , beside the Spaniard be therein so disperse , as they be no where strong , but in Nueva Espanna only : the sharp mountain , the thorn , and poison prickle , the sandy and deep way in the valley , the smother heat and air , and want of water in other place be their only and best defence , which ( because those nation that invade they be not victual or provide to stay , neither have any place to friend adjoin ) do serve they in steed of good arm and great multitude . 429 the west Indies be first offer her majesty grandfather by Columbus a stranger , in who there may be doubt of deceit , and beside it be then think incredible that there be such and so many land and region never write of before . this empire be make know to her majesty by her own vassal , and by he that owe to her more duty than a ordinary subject , so that it shall ill sort with the many grace and benefit which i have receive to abuse her highness , either with fable or imagination . the country be already discover , many nation win to her majesty love and obedience , and those Spaniard which have late and long labour about the conquest , beat out , discourage and disgrace , which among these nation be think invincible . her majesty may in this enterprise employ all those soldier and gentleman that be young brethren , and all captain and chieftain that want employment , and the charge will be only the first set out in victual and arm they : for after the first or second year i doubt not but to see in London a contractation house of more receipt for Guiana , than there be now in Seville for the west Indies . and i be resolve that if there be but a small army a foot in Guiana , march towards Manoa the chief city of Inga , he will yield to her majesty by composition so many hundred thousand pound yearly , as shall both defend all enemy abroad , and defray all expense at home , and that he will beside pay a garrison of three or four thousand soldier very royal to defend he against other nation : for he can but know , how his predecessor , yea how his own great uncle Guascar and Atabalipa son to Guainacapa emperor of Peru , be ( while they contend for the empire ) beat out by the Spaniard , and that both of late year and ever since the say conquest , the Spaniard have seek the passage and entrey of his country : and of their cruelty use to the 43 Â° * 595 - borderer he can be ignorant . in which respect no doubt but he will be bring to tribute with great gladness , if not , he have neither shot nor iron weapon in all his empire , and therefore may easy be conquer . and i far remember that Berreo confess to i and other ( which i protest before the majesty of God to be true ) that there be find among prophecy in Peru ( at such time as the empire be reduce to the spanish obedience ) in their chief temple , among diverse other which foreshow the loss of the say empire , that from Inglatierra those Ingas shall be again in time to come restore , and deliver from the servitude of the say conqueror . and i hope , as we with these few hand have displant the first garrison , and drive they out of the say country , so her majesty will give order for the rest , and either defend it , and hold it as tributary , or conquer and keep it as empress of the same . for whatsoever prince shall possess it , shall be great , and if the king , of Spain enjoy it , he will become unresistable . her majesty hereby shall confirm and strengthen the opinion of all nation , as touch her great and princely action . and where the south border of Guiana reach to the dominion and empire of the Amazon , those woman shall hereby hear the name of a virgin , which be not only able to defend she own territory and her neighbour , but also to invade and conquer so great empire and so far remove . to speak more at this time , i fear will be but troublesome : i trust in God , this be true , will suffice , and that he which be king of all king and lord of lord , will put it into her heart which be lady of lady to possess it , if not , i will judge those man worthy to be king thereof , that by her grace and leave will undertake it of themselves .
