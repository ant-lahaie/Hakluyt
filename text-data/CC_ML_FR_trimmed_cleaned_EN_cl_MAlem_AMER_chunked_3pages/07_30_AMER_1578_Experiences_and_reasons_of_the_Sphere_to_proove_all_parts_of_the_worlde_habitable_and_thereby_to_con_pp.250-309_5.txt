time of the flood while they remain in the ark , they shall use continency , and abstain from carnail copulation with their wife : and many other precept he give unto they , and admonition touch the justice of God , in revenge sin , and his mercy in deliver they , 263 who nothing deserve it . which good instruction and exhortation notwithstanding his wicked son I | be disobey , and be persuade that the first child bear after the flood ( by right and law of nature ) shall inherit and possess all the dominion of the earth , he contrary to his father commandment while they be yet in the ark , use company with his wife , and crafty go about thereby to disinherit the offspring of his other two brethren : for the which wicked and detestable fact , as a example for contempt of almighty God , and disobedience of parent , God will a son shall be bear who name be Chus , who not only it self , but all his posterity after he shall be so black and loathsome , that it may remain a spectacle of disobedience to all the world . and of this black and curse Chus come all these black moor which be in Africa , for after the water be vanish from off - the face of the earth , and that the land be dry , Sem choose that part of the land to inhabit in , which now be call Asia , and Japhet have that which now be call Europa , wherein we dwell , and Africa remain for cham and his black son Chus , and be call Chamesis after the father name , be perhaps a curse , dry , sandy , and unfruitful ground , fit for such a generation to inhabit in . thus you see , that the cause of the ethiopian blackness be the curse and natural infection of blood , and not the distemperature of the climate ; which also may be prove by this example , that these black man be find in all part of Africa , as well without the tropicke , as within , even unto Capo de buona Speranza southward , where , by reason of the sphere , shall be the same temperature that be in Sicilia , Morea and Candie , where all be of very good complexion . wherefore i conclude , that the blackness proceed not of the hotenesse of the climb , but as i say , of the infection of blood , and therefore this their argument gather of the african blackness be not able to destroy the temperature of the middle zone . we may therefore very well be ascertain , 264 that under the equinoctial be the most pleasant and delectable place of the world to dwell in ; where although the sun for two hour in a year be direct over their head , and therefore the heat at that time somewhat of force , yet because it come so seidome , and continue so small a time , when it come , it be not to be weigh , but rather the moderate heat of other great tem - time in all the year to be remember . and if the feature under heat at any time shall in the short day wax somewhat ^ umoc ~ urgent , the coldness of the long night there will easy refresh it , accord as Honterus say , speak of the temperature under the equinoctial . qu6dque die solis violento incanduit aestu , Humida nox reficit , paribusque refrigerat horis . if the heat of the sun in the day time do burn or parch any thing , the moisture of the night do cool and refresh the same again , the sun be as long absent in the night , as it be present in the day . also our author of the sphere , Johannes de Sacro Bosco , in the chapter of the zodiac , derive the etymologic of Zodiacus , of the greek word so , which in latin signify vita , life ; for out of Aristotle he allege , that secundum accessum and recessum solis in Zodiaco , fiunt generationes and corruptione in rebus inferioribus : accord to the sun go to and fro in the zodiac , the inferior body take their cause of generation and corruption . than it follow , that where there be most go too and fro , there be most generation and corruption : which must needs be between the two tropicke ; for there the sun go too and from most , and no where else but there . therefore between they under the two tropike , that be , in the middle zone , be great Equinoctiallis increase , multiplication , generation , and corruption of thing , which also we find by experience ; for there be it summer twice in the year , and twice winter , so that they have two harvest in the year , and continual spring . see then the middle zone fall out so 265 great heat under the tropics . temperate , it rest to dedare where the hot part of the world shall be , for we find some place more hot than other . to answer this doubt , reason persuade , the ho test place in the world to be under and about the two tropicke ; for there more then in any other place do both the cause of heat concur , that be , the perpendicular fall of the sun beam , at right angle , and a great continuance of the sun above the horizon , the pole there be elevate three or four and twenty degree . and as before i conclude , that though the sun be perpendicular to they under the equinoctial , yet because the same continue but a small time , ( their day be short , and their night long ) and the speedy departure of the sun from their zenith , because of the sudden cross of the zodiac with the equinoctial , and that by such continual course and recourse of hot and cold , the temperature grow moderate , and very well able to be endure : so now to they under the two tropicke , the sun have once by his proper motion decline twenty degree from the equinoctial ,
