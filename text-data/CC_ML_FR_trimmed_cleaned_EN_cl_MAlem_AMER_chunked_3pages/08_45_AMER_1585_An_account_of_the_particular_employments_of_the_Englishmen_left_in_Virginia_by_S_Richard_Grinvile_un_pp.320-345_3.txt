and the reason be for that it be red and hard , whereas that of Chaunis Temoatan be very soft , and pale : they say that they take the say mettle out of a river that fall very swift from high rock and hill , and they take it in shallow water : the manner be this . they take a great bowl by their description as great as one of our target , and wrap a skin over the hollow part thereof , leave one part open to receive in the minerail : that do , they watch the come down of the current , and the change of the colour of the water , and then sudden chap down the say bowl with the skin , and receive into the same as much oar as will come in , which be ever as much as their bowl will hold , which present they cast into a fire , and forthwith it melt , and do yield in five part , at the first melt , two part of metal for three part of oar . of this metal the mangoak have so great store , by report of all the savage adjoin , that they beautify their house with great plate of the same : and this to be true , i receive by report of all the country , and particular by young Skiko , the king of Chawanooks son my prisoner , who also himself have be prisoner with the mangoak , and set down all the particularity to i before mention : but he have not be at chawnis Temoatan himself : for he say , it be twenty day journey overland from the mangoak , to the say mineral country , and that they pass through certain other territory between they and the mangoak , before they come to the say country . upon report of the premise , which i be very inquisitive in all place where i come to take very particular information of , by all the savage that dwell towards those part , and especial of Menatonon himself , who in every thing do very particular inform i , and promise i guide of his own man , who shall pass over with i , even to the say country 329 of Chaunis Temoatan ( for overland from Chawanook to the mangoak be but one day journey from sun rise to sun set , whereas by water it be seven day with the soon : ) these thing , i say , make i very desirous by all mean possible to recover the mangoak , and to get some of that their copper for a assay , and therefore i willing yield to their resolution : but it fall out very contrary to all expectation , and likelihood : for after two day travel , and our whole victuali spend , lie on shore all night , we can never see man , only fire we may perceive make alongst the shore where we be to pass , and up into the country , until the very last day . in the evening whereof , about three of the clock we hear certain savage call as we think , Manteo , who be also at that time with i in the boat , whereof we all be very glad , hope of some friendly conference with they , and make he to answer they , they present begin a song , as we think , in token of our welcome to they : but Manteo present betake he to his piece , and tell i that they mean to fight with we : which word be not so soon speak by he , and then a conflict light horseman ready to put to shore , but there light begin by they a vopje of their arrow among they in the boat , * s ' but do no hurt ( God be thank ) to any man . in - mediate , the other boat lie ready with their shot to skoure the place for our hand weapon to land upon , which be present do , although the land be very high and steep , the savage forthwith quit the shore , and betake themselves to flight : we land , and have fair and easy follow for a small time after they , who have wooded themselves we know not where : the sun draw then towards the set , and be then assure that the next day if we will pursue they , though we may happen to meet with they , yet we shall be assure to meet with none of their victuali , which we then have good cause to think of : therefore choose for the company a con - 330 venient ground in safety to lodge in for the night , make a strong corpse of guard , and put out good centinel , i determine the next morning before the rise of the sun to be go back again , if possible we may recover the mouth of the river , into the broad sound , which at my first motion i find my whole company ready to assent unto : for they be now come to their dog porridge , that they have bespeak for themselves if that befall they which do , and i before do mistrust we shall hardly escape . the end be , we come the next day by night to the river mouth within four or five mile of the same , have row in one day down the current , as much as in , four day we have do against the same : we lodge upon a hand , where we have nothing in the world to eat but pottage of sassafras leave , the like whereof for a meat be never use before as i think . the broad sound we have to pass the next day all fresh and fast : that day the wind blow so strong , and the billow so great , that there be no possibility of passage without sink of our boat . this be upon easter eve , which be fast very true . upon Easter day in the morning the wind come very calm , we enter the sound , and by four of the clock we be at Chipanum , whence all the savage that we have leave there be flee , but their wear do yield we some fish , as God be please not utter to suffer we to be lose : for some of our company of the light horseman be far spend . the next morning we arrive at our home Roanoak . i have set down this voyage somewhat particular , to the end it may appear unto you ( as true it be ) that there want no great good will from the most to the least
