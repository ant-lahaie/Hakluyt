coast range , we find no convenient water place , whereby there be no remedy but to disemboque , and to water upon the coast of Florida : for , to go further to the eastward , we can not for the shoald , which be very dangerous ; and because the current shoot to the north - east , we doubt by the force thereof to be set upon they , and therefore dare not approach they : so make but reasonable way the day aforesaid , and all the night , the twelve day in the morning we fall with the island upon the cape of Florida , which we can scant double by the mean that fear the shoald to the eastwards , the state of and doubt the current come out of the west , the current of which be not of that force we make account of ; for 011 of our feel little or none till our fell with the cape , and then feel such a current , that bear all sail against the same , yet be drive back again a great pace : the experience whereof we have by the Jesus pinnace , and the Salomons boat , which be send the same day in the afternoon , while the ship be becalm , to see if they can find any water upon the island aforesaid ; who spend a great part of the day in row thither , be further offend than they deem it to be , and in the mean time a fair gale of wind spring at sea , the ship depart , make a sign to they to come away , who although they see they depart , because they be so near the shore , will not lose all the labour they have take , but determine to keep their way , and see if there be any water to be have , make no account but to find the ship well enough : but they spend so much time in fill the water which they have find , that the night be come before they can make a end . and have lose the sight of the ship , they row what they can , but be whole ignorant which way they shall seek they again ; as indeed there be a more doubt than they know of : for when they depart , the ship be in no current ; and sail but a mile further , they find one so strong , that bear all sail , it can not prevail against the same , but be drive back : whereupon the captain send the Salomon , with the other two bark , to bear near the shore all night , because the current be less there a great deal , and to bear light , with shoot off a piece now and then , to the intent the boat may better know how to come to they . the jesus also bear a light in her top gallant , and shoot off a piece also now and then , but the night pass , and the morning be come , be the thirteenth day , and no news can be hear of they , but the ship and bark cease not to look still for they , yet they think it be all in vain , by the mean they hear not of they all the night past ; and therefore determine to tarry no long , seek for they till noon , and if they hear no news , than they will depart to the Jesus , who perforce ( by the vehemency of the current ) be carry almost out of sight ; but as God will have it , now time be come , and they have tack about in the pinnace top , have sight of they , and take they up : they in the boat , be to the number of one and twenty , have sight of the ship , ten 49 d and see they tack about ; whereas before at the first sight of they they do great rejoice , be now in a great perplexity than ever they be : for by this they think themselves utter forsake , whereas before they be in some hope to have find they . Truly God wrought marvellous for they , for they themselves have no victual but water , and be sore oppress with hunger , be not of opinion to bestow any further time in seek the ship then that present noon time ; so that if they have not at that instant espy they , they have go to the shore to have make provision for victual , and with such thing as they can have get , either to have go for that part of Florida where the french man be plant ( which will have be very hard for they to have do , because they want victual to bring they thither , be a hundred and twenty league off7 ) or else to have remain among the floridians ; at who hand they be put in comfort by a french man , who be with they , that have remain in Florida at the first find thereof , a whole year together , to receive victual sufficient , and gentle entertainment , if need be , for a year or two , until which time God may have provide for they . but how contrary this will have fall out to their expectation , it be hard to judge , see those people of the cape of Florida be off more savage and fierce nature , and more valiant than any of the rest ; which the Spaniard well prove , who be five hundred man , who intend there to land , return few or none of they , but be enforce to forsake the same : and of their cruelty mention be make in the book of the decade , of a friar , who take upon he to persuade the people to subjection , be by they take , and his skin cruel pull over his ear , and his flesh eat . in these island they be a shore , find a dead man , dry in a manner whole , with other head and body of man : so that these sort of man be eater of the flesh of man , aswell as the cannibal . but to return to our purpose . the fourteen day the ship and bark come to the Jesus , bring they news of the
