of my boot , upon the inside of my left leg , and so within 3 or 4 day after that i have thus receive my knife , i be sudden call for , and bring before the head justice which cause those my iron with the round bolt to be strike off and send to a smith in the town , where be a new pair of bolt make ready for i of another fashion , which have a broad iron bar come between the shackle , and cause my hand to be make fast with a pair of manacle , and so be i present lay into a wagon all alone , which be there ready to depart with sundry other wagon , to the number of 60 . towards Mexico , and they all be lade with sundry merchandise which come in the fleet out of Spain . the wagon that i be in be foremost in all the company , and as we travel i be alone in the wagon , begin to try if i can pluck my hand out of the manacle , and as God will , although it be 437 mile fillip his last wonderful escape . somewhat painful for i , yet my hand be so slender that 1 can pull they out , and put they in again , and ever as we go , when the wagon make most noise , and the man be busy , i will be work to file off my bolt , and travel thus for the space of 8 league from Vera Cruz , we come to a high hill , at the enter up of which ( as God will ) one of the wheel of the wagon wherein i be , break , so that by that mean the other wagon go afore , and the wagon - man that have charge of i set a indian carpenter a work to mend the wheel : and here at this place they bait at a hostry that a negro - woman keep : and at this place , for that the go up of the hill be very steep , for the space of two league and better , they do always accustom to take the moile of 3 or 4 wagon , and to place they altogether for the draw up of one wagon , and so to come down again , and fetch up other in that order . all which come very well to pass : for as it draw towards night when most of the waggoner be go to draw up their wagon , in this sort i be alone have quick file off my bolt , and so espy my time in the dark of the evening before they return down the hill again , i convey my self into the wood there adjoin , carry my bolt and manacle with i , and a few biscuit , and two small cheese . And be come into the wood , i throw my iron into a thick bush , and then cover they with moss and other thing , and then shift for my self as i may all that night . and thus by the good providence of almighty God , i be free from my iron all save the collar that be about my neck , and so get my liberty the second time . 438 wherein be show how i escape to Guatimala , upon the south sea , and from thence to the port of Cavallos , where i get passage to go into Spain , and of our arrival at Havana , and our come to Spain , where i be again like to have be commit prisoner , and how through the great mercy of God i escape , and come home in safety into England in February 1582 . the next morning ( day light be come ) i perceive by the sun rise what way to take to escape their hand , for when i flee , i take the way into the wood upon the left hand : and have leave that way that go to Mexico upon my right hand , i think to keep my course as the wood and mountains lay , still direct south as near as i can : by mean whereof i be sure to convey my self far enough from that way that go to Mexico . and as i be thus go in the wood , i see many great fire make to the north not past a league from the mountain where i be , and travail thus in my boot with my iron collar about my neck , and my bread and cheese , the very same forenoon i meet with a company of Indians which be hunt of deer for their sustenance : to who i speak in the Mexican tongue , and tell they how that i have of a long time be keep in prison by the cruel Spaniard , and do desire they to help i to file off my iron collar , which they willing do : rejoice great with i , that i be thus escape out of the Spaniard hand . than i desire that i may have one of they to guide i out of those desert mountain towards the south , which they also most willing do : and so they bring i to a indian town 8 . league distant from thence , name Shalapa , where i stay three day , for that i be somewhat sickly . at which town ( with the gold that i have quilt in my doublet ) i buy i a horse 439 of one of the Indians , which cost i 6 . pezo , and so travail south , within the space of 2 . league i happen to overtake a grey friar , one that i have be familiar withal in Mexico , who than i know to be a zealous good man , and one that do much lament the cruelty use against we by the inquisitor , and true he use i very courteous : and i have confidence in he do indeed tell he , that i be mind to adventure to see if i can get out of the say country if i can find ship , and do therefore pray he of his aid , direction , and advise herein , which
