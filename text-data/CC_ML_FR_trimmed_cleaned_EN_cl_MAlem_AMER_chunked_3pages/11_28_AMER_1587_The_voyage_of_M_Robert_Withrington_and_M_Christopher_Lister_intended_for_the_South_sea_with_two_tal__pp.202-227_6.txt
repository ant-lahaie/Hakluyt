one from the other . but be once go , there be no remedy but they be to abide whatsoever may happen : we in the bark Clifford , 218 although we be weak leave , yet perceive the galley to make after our man , weigh and pursue the galley , as near the shore as we can convenient come for want of water : the hulk also weigh and come after we to follow the enemy , but the enemy with his oar get sight of our pinnace and boat before we can , and bear direct with they : which be espy of our man , and they see no way to avoid they , make themselves ready ( notwithstanding the great odds ) to fight it out like man , and to live and die together . the course that they take for their best advantage upon the sudden , be this : they go all into the pinnace , and make fast the dutchmans boat to one side , and the small caravel to the other side , and so wait the come of the enemy , give they first of all a piece of ordinance for their welcome , which they present repay again with a piece out of the prow of the galley , and present after , with three or four small brass piece , charge with hailshot , and so give a mighty shout , come all aboard together , cry , entrad , entrad : but our man receive they so hot , with small shot and pike , that they kill they like dog . and thus they continue aboard they almost a quarter of a hour , think to have devour our man , pinnace and all . and sure to man judgement , no other thing be likely in regard of their great number , and the fewness of our man , and they at the first think all be their own : but God , who be the giver of all victory , so bless our small company , and so strengthen their arm and mind to fight , that the enemy have receive a mighty foil , be glad to rid himself from their hand : and whereas at their marvellous entrance , we esteem they to be no less than betwixt two hundred and three hundred man in the afewofour galley , we can scarce perceive twenty man at their man . departure stand on their leg , but the great part of they be slay , many deadly wound , their oar break , and she depart from our man , hang upon one side ( as a sow that have lose her left ear ) with 219 above 360 Portugal and Indians slay . the number of dead and wound man that lie one upon another . and whereas their come aboard be in a great bravado , with drum , shout , and cry , they depart without either noise of drum or speech . we lose in this conflict of our man , three only , which be Alexander the master Gunners mate , Laurence Gambrel , a proper young man of Hampton , and another that be master benman man . some also be hurt with the arrow of the enemy , but the wound be curable : and thus it please Almighty God , of his great goodness , to give victory to 50 or 60 Englishman , against six or seven hundred Portugal and Indians , for which we cease not to give such dutiful thank to his majesty , as so miraculous a victory require . now touch the purpose of our man , who make that attempt for fresh victual , their labour be nothing lose , but in despite of the enemy they bring to our ship 16 or 17 young bullock , which be to our great comfort and refresh . as for we that be in our ship , we can not come near they by two mile , or more , to give they any aid , yet we suppose that the countenance of our ship be a encouragement to our man , and some manner of fear to the enemy . now whereas our opinion concern the number of the Portugal and Indians which be slay , as aforesaid , be ground at that time upon our probable conjecture , not be able otherwise to come to the knowledge thereof : you shall understand that the next night after the fight there come aboard we two Indians upon a Gyngatho , who be run away from their master , and they tell we for a very good truth , that the galley go out from the town with four hundred man in she , but there come not back to the town again alive above thirty of they all : and i among the rest be desirous to know of one of they , what the news be at the town , he answer i with great laughter : todo esta cacado en tierra . 220 the twelve day i be send for to come aboard the admiral , about the hulk : where upon the complaint of the Dutchman , master Withrington enter into bond to they for the payment of their fraught , but how my lord will like that bond of debt at our return , i know not . i give he my advice and counsel to get his bond again into his hand . the thirteenth day our captain send out of our ship certain victual unto the admiral , as one butt of dight rise , two chest of clean rise , one barrel of oatmeal , one barrel of peason , and one barrel of oil , because they be somewhat scant of victual , and we at this time be to have out of the admiral our part of five and twenty chest of fine sugar , and more , of eight chest , and six chest that be take in the bay of todo santos , at the ingenios , more of one hundred and thirty hat , and other diverse pillage , which be take in the prize , and at the shore . the fourteen day be Monday , it be conclude among we all , not to leave the town of Baya so , but notwithstanding the time that they have to strengthen themselves and the town , yet to give a attempt for the win of it : and therefore we provide our pinnace , caravel , and boat for the enterprise : and as we be depart from our ship , the wind turn direct contrary to our course , so that our determination for that time be break , and we return again to our ship : and to say the truth , if the weather and wind have serve , our attempt have be
