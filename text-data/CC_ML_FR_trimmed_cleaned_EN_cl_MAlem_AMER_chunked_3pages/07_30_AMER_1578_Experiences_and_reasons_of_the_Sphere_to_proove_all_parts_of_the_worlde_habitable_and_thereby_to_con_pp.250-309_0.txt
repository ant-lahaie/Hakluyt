[ experience 251 experience and reason of the sphere , to prove all part of the world habitable , and thereby to confute the position of the five zone . experience to prove thattor - rida zona be habitable . irst , it may be gather by experience of our Englishman in anno 1553 . for captain Windam make a voyage with merchandise to Guinea , and enter so far within the torrida zona , that he be within three or four degree of the equinoctial , and his company abide there certain month , return , with gain . also the Englishman make another voyage very prosperous and gainful , An . 1554 . to the coast of Guinea , within 3 . degree of the equinoctial . and yet it be report of a truth , that all the tract from cape de las Palmas trending by C . de tres puntas alongst by Benin , unto the he of saint Thomas ( which be perpendicular under the equinoctial ) all that whole bay be more subject to many bloom and smother heat , with infectious and contagious air , than any other place in all torrida zona : and the cause thereof be some accident in the land . for it be most certain , that mountain , sea , wood and lake etc may cause through their sundry kind of situation , sundry strange and extraordinary effect , which the reason of the climb otherwise will not give . i mention these voyage of our Englishman , not so much to prove that torrida zona may be , and be inhabit , as to show their readiness in attempt long and dangerous navigation . we also among we in England have black moor , . / ethiopian , out of all part of torrida zona , which after a small continuance , can well endure the cold of our country , and why shall not we as well abide the heat of their country ? but what shall i name any more experience , see that all the coast of Guinea and Benin be inhabit of Portugal , span - 252 yard , french , and some Englishman , who there have build castle and town . only this i will say to the merchant of London , that trade yearly to Marochus , it be very certain , that the great part of the burn zone be far more temperate and cool in June , than the country of Marochus , as shall appear by these reason and experience follow . for let we first consider the breadth and bigness of this burn zone ( which as every man know , be 47 . degree ) each Tropic , which be the bounder thereof , be 23 . degree and a half distant from the equinoctial . imagine again two other parallel , on each side the equinoctial one , either of they distant from the equinoctial about 20 . degree , which parallel may be describe either of they twice a year by the sun , be in the first degree of gemini the 11 . of may , and in Leo the 13 . of July , have north latitude . and again , the sun be in the first degree of sagittarius , the 12 . of November , and in Aquarius the 9 of January , have south latitude , i be to prove by experience and reason , that all that distance include between these two parallel last name (
