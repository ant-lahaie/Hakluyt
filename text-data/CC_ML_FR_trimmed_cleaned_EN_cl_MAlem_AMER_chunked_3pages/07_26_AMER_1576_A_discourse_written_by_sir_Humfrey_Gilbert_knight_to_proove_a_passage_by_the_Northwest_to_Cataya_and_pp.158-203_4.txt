Baros lib . 9 of his first decas cap . 1 . Chap . 3 . PAulus Venetus , who dwell many year in Cataia , affirm that he sail 1500 mile upon the coast of Mangia , and Anian , towards the north - east : always find the sea open before he , not only as far as he go , but also as far as he can discern . 2 also Franciscus Vasques de Coronado pass from Mexico by Cevola , through the country of Quivira , to Siera Nevada , find there a great sea , where be certain ship lade with merchandise , carry on their prowess the picture of certain bird call Alcatrarzi , part whereof be make of gold , and part of silver , who signify by sign , that they be thirty day come thither : which likewise prove America by experience to be disjoined from Cataia , on that part by a great sea , because they can not come from any part of America , as native thereof : for that , so far as be discover , there have not be find there any one ship of that country . 3 in like manner , John Baros testify that the cosmographers of china ( where he himself have be ) affirm that the sea coast trend from thence Northeast , to 50 degree of septentrional latitude , be the further part that way which the Portugal have then knowledge of : and that the say cosmographer know no cause to the contrary , but that it may continue further . by who experience America be prove to be separate from those part of Asia , direct against the same . and not content with the judgement of these learned man only , i have search what may be further say for the confirmation hereof . 170 4 and i find that Franciscus Lopez de Gomara affirm America to be a island , and likewise Gronland : and that Gronland be distant from Lappia 40 league , and from terra de Labrador , 50 . 5 moreover , Alvarus Nunnius a Spaniard , and learned cosmographer , and Jacobus Cartier , who make two voyage into those part , and sail 900 mile upon the north - east coast of America do in part confirm the same . 6 likewise Hieronymus Fracastorius , a learned italian , and traveler in the north part of the same land . 7 also Jaques Cartier have do the like , hear say at Hochelaga in Nova Francia , how that there be a great sea at Saguinay , whereof the end be not know : which they presuppose to be the passage to Cataia . furthermore , Sebastian Cabota by his personal ex - write in the perience and travel have set forth , and describe this discourse of passage in his Charts , which be yet to be see in the 1 avl ^ a wn ' queen majesty privy gallery at Whitehall , who be send to make this discovery by king Henry the seven , and enter the same fret : affirm that he sail very far westward , with a quarter of the north , on the northside of Terra de Labrador the eleven of June , until he come to the septentrionali latitude of 67 degree and a half , and find the sea still open , say , that he may , and will have go to Cataia , if the mutiny of the master and mariner have not be . now as these man experience have prove some part of this passage : so the chapter follow shall put you in full assurance of the rest , by their experience which have pass through every part thereof .
