The anclent assistance of the kings of England against infidels.

The Oration or speech of the Ambassadours sent from Conradus de Zolner Master generail of the land of Prussia, unto Richard the second, King of England, and France, &c.

The messengers which are sent from the Master generali of the land of Prussia, doe propound and declare the affaires and negotiations underwritten.

Hereas it is apparant, that divers and sundrie times heeretofore, your famous progenitours and predecessours the kings of England have alwaies bene gratious promoters and speciali friends unto the generali Masters of the land of Prussia, and of the whole order:

whereas also they have vouchsafed, by their Barons, Knights, and other their nobles of the kingdome of England, unto the Masters and order aforesaide, sundry and manifolde favourable assistances in the conquest of the Infidels (in whose steppes your excellent Majestie insisting, have, in these your dayes shewed your selfe in like sort right graciously affected unto the Master generail which nowe is, and unto his famous Pre-decessour) in due consideration of the premisses, and in regard also of divers other affaires, which are at this present to be propounded unto your Highnes, the foresaid Master general which now is hath caused us his messengers to be sent with letters of credence unto your Majestie: humbly praying, and earnestly beseeching your roial clemency, that in times to come, the said Master general, his successors, & our whole Order may of your bounty most graciously obtaine the same favour, benevolence, and stedfast amity & friendship, which hath bin continued from the times of your foresaid predecessors : in regard wherof we do offer the said Master of ours, and our whole company, unto your highnes, as your perpetual and devote friends. Notwithstanding 12

(most sovereigne Prince) certaine other things we have to propound unto your Grace, in the name & behalfe of our saide Master and Order, by way of complaint, namely, that at certaine times past, and especially within the space of x. yeres last expired, his subjects and marchants have sustained sundry damages and ablations of their goods, by divers subjects and inhabitants of your realme of England, and that very often, both by sea and land : the which, for the behalf, and by the appointment of the Master general aforesaid, & of his predecessor, are put downe in registers, and recorded in the writings of his cities in the land of Prussia. Of which parties damnified, some have obtained letters from the Master general that now is, & also from his pre- [I. 149.] decessor, unto your renoumed grandfather K. Edward Edward the 3. of famous memory, and sundry times unto your high-nes also, to have restitution made for their goods taken from them : whereby they have nothing at al prevailed, but heaping losse upon losse have misspent their time & their charges: both because they were not permitted to propound & exhibit their complaints & letters before your majesty, and also for divers other impediments. Certain of them also considering how others of their countriemen had laboured in vain, & fearing the like successe, have troubled the Master general very often with grievous and sundry complaints, craving & humbly beseeching at his hands, that he would vouchsafe graciously to provide for them as his faithful & loial subjects, as touching the restitution of their losses: especially seeing y‘ so much wealth of the English marchants was every yeere to be found in Prussia, as being arrested, they might obtaine some reasonable satisfaction for their losses. Which thing the Master general aforesaid & his predecessor also have deferred unto this present (albeit to ye great losse of their subjects) therby having meere & principal respect unto those special curtesies and favours which your excellent Majesty & your worthy progenitors have

right gratiously vouchsafed upon our Masters and Order : neither yet for the injuries aforesaid, was there ever any maner of offence, or molestation offered unto any of your subjects noble or ignoble whatsoever. Moreover, in the name & behalfe of our foresaid Ma. general we do propound unto your excellency by way of complaint, that in the yere last past, 6. dayes after ye feast of the Ascension, certain persons of your realm of England, with their ships & captains comming unto the port of Flanders, named Swen, & finding there, amongst sundry other, 6. ships of Prussia resident, which had there arrived wl divers goods & marchandises: and being informed that they were of Prussia, & their friends, they caused them & their ships to remain next unto their owne ships, protesting unto them, that they should in no sort be molested or damnified by themselves or by any other of their company, & that they would faithfully defend them, as if they were their own people, from ye hands of their adversaries : & for their farther security & trust, they delivered some of their own men & their standerds into our mens ships : howbeit a while after being stirred up, & bent far otherwise, they took out of ye foresaid ships al kind of armors, wherwith they were to gard & defend themselves from pirats, & they deteined the masters of those ships, not suffring them to return unto their own ships & companies, one also of ye said ships (having taken al the goods out of her) they consumed with fire. And within 3. dales after they came with one accord unto ye abovenamed ships, and tooke away from them all goods and marchandises which they could find, and all the armour and weapons of the said ships, the chestes also of the marchants, of the ship-masters, & of other persons they brake open, taking out money, jewels, garments, & divers other commodities : and so they inflicted upon them irrecoverable losses and unkind grievances. And departing out of the foresaid haven, they caried 2. of the Prussian ship-masters with them,

as their captives unto an haven of England called Sandwich. Who, being afterward released, were compelled to sweare, that they should not declare ye injuries offred unto them, either before your roiall majesty, or your hon. Councell, or your chancelor: neither were they permitted to come on shore. And being offred such hard measure, when they made pitiful mones & complaints unto your foresaide subjects, amongst other matters they spake on this wise unto them : Do you complain of injuries & losses offered unto you ? Loe, in your own countrey of Prussia there are English marchants, & goods sufficient, go your waies home therfore, & recover your losses, taking two for one: and in this maner they were left, & so departed. Afterward returning unto ye land of Prussia, they & their friends repaired unto the Mast, general, jointly & wl one consent making their complaint unto him of the losses which had bin inflicted upon them by your subjects. And prostrating themselves at his feet, they all and every of them made their humble sutes, y‘ he would have compassion on them, as upon his poore subjects, regarding them selves, their wives, & children, and pitying their distres, and penury, and that he would graciously procure some redresse for them. And when he offred his letters unto them, wishing them to prosecute their cause before your highnes, they answered that they were no way able to defray the expenses, and that others, who were in like sort damnified, had laboured that way altogether in vain & to no purpose : beseeching him again and again, that he would by another kind of means, namely by arresting of your marchants and their goods, procure them restitution of their losses. At length the Master general The arresting being moved by so many and so great complaints, and by the molestation of his subjects, caused (albeeit full ^a^ants sore against his will) a certaine portion of English marchants goods to be laid hold on, and to be arrested, in his cities of Elburg & Dantzik, and to be bestowed

in sure places, until such time as he might conveniently by his messengers propound and exhibit all and singular the premisses unto your highnes. And forasmuch as the foresaid Master general and our Order do know no just occasion, wherby they have deserved your majesties indignation, but are firmely and most undoubtedly perswaded, to finde all curtesie, favour, and friendship at your Highnesse, according to your wonted clemencie : the said Master generali therefore maketh no doubt, that al the above written damages St molestations, being in such sort, against God and justice, oflred unto his subjects by yours, be altogether unknown unto your magnificence, & committed against your mind : wherfore presently upon the foresaid arrest of your marchants goods, he dispatched his messengers unto your roial majesty. Wherof one deceased by the way, namely in the territory of Holland : & the other remained sick in those parts for a long season : & so that ambassage took none effect. Wherfore the said master general was desirous to send us now ye second time also unto your Highnes. We do make our humble sute therfore, in the name & behalf of our Master and Order aforesaid, unto your kingly supremacy, that, having God and justice before your eies, and also the dutifull and obsequious demeanor of the said master, and order towards you, you would vouchsafe to extend your gracious clemency, for the redresse of the premisses : wherby the foresaid losses may be restored and repaied unto our subjects. All which notwithstanding, that it would please you of your wisedome & providence to procure so absolute a remedy, by meanes whereof, in time to come, such dealings and inconveniences may be avoided on both parts, & finally that your marchants may quietly be possessed of their goods arrested in Prussia, and our marchants may be admitted unto the possession of their commodities attached in England, to convert & apply them unto such uses, as to themselves shal seem

most convenient. Howbeit (most gracious prince and lord) we are to sollicite your Highnesse, not onely about the articles to be propounded concerning the losses aforesaide, but more principally, for certain sinister reports and superstitious slanders, wherwith certaine of your subjects, not seeking for peace, have falsly informed your majesty, & your most honorable and discreete Councel : affirming that at the time of ye aforesaid arrest your marchants were barbarously intreated, that they were cast into lothsom prisons, drenched in myre and water up to ye neck, restrained from al conference and company of men, and also that their meat was thrown unto them, as a bone to a dog, with many other enormities, which they have most slanderously devised concerning the master general aforesaid, and his people, and have published them in these dominions : upon the occasion of which falshoods certain marchants of our parts, and of other regions of Alemain (who, of your special benevolence, were indued with certaine privileges and favours in your citie of London, and in other places) were, as malefactors, apprehended and caried to prison, until such time as the trueth was more apparant. Whereupon, the foresaide master generali propoundeth his humble sute unto your majestie, that such enemies of trueth and concord, your Majesty woulde vouchsafe in such sort to chastise, that they may be an example unto others presuming to doe the like.

Moreover, (high and mighty Prince and lord) it was reported unto our Master general, that his former Legats required of your majesty safe conduct freely to come into your highnesse Realme. Which when hee heard, he was exceedingly offended therat, sithence undoubtedly they did not this at his commaundement or direction. We therefore humbly beseech your Grace, as touching this oversight, to holde the Master generali excused, because there is no need of safe conduct, between so speciali friends.

Furthermore, sundry damages and complaints of the foresaid general Master, and his subjects are briefly exhibited, and put downe in the billes following. Also, all and singular damnified persons, besides other proofes, were compelled to verifie their losses by their formali othes, taken upon the holy Bible.

Lastly, we doe make our humble suite and petition unto the providence and discretion of your Highnes, and of your honorable Councell, that concerning the premisses, and all other matters propounded, or to be propounded unto your Majesty, we may obtaine a speedy answere, and an effectuall end. For it would redound unto our great charges and losse to make any long delayes.
