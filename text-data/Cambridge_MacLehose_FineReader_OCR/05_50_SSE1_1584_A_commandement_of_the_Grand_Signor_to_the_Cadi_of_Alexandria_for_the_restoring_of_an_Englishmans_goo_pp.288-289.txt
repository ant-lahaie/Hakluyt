A commaundement for Egypt.

SCito quod orator Reginae Angliae in porta mea existens libellum supplicem ad portam nostram mittens significavit, quod cum ex Agypto Consul eorum abesset, Consul illic Gallicus existens, Vento nuncupatus, quamvis ante haec tempora ne manus in Anglos mitteret mandatum nostrum fuerit datum, Angli sub vexillo & tutela nostra sunt inquiens, mandatum Caesareum vili existimans, non cessavit perturbare Anglos. Quare scito quod Reginae Angliae privilegium nostrum est datum. Juxta illud privilegium Anglis nulla ratione Consul Gallicus Consulatum agat, neve manus immittat, mandatum nostrum postulavit ejus legatus. Quare mando, ut contra privilegium nostrum Consul Gallicus Anglis injuriam non inferat, neve Consulatum agat. Judici Aegypti literae nostrae sunt datae : hanc ob causam mando tibi quoque, ut juxta illud mandatum nostrum, contra privilegium nostrum Anglis Gallum Consulatum agere nunquam patiare. Sic scito, & insigni meo fidem adhibeto.

you have not looked to it heretofore, now carefully looke to it, & if it be according to their Arz or certificate presented unto us, that the foresaid French Consuli Vento hath wrongfully taken into his power the goods of the deceased English marchant under his seale, that then you cause him to restore all the said goods and marchandise sealed by him, and make good that which is thereof wanting unto the English marchants : doe in this matter according to justice, and credite this our seale.

A commandement to the Bassa of Alexandria.

THe Embassadour for the Queenes most excellent

Majesty of England by supplication certified us, how that notwithstanding our privilege granted them to make Consuls in al parts of our dominions to governe their nation according to their owne custome & law, to defend them against all wrongs and injuries whatsoever : yet that the French Consuli affirming to thee that art Bassa, that they were under his banner, and that he should governe them, and oversee their businesse, and having got a new privilege, mentioning therein the English men to be under his banner, did by all meanes molest 8c trouble them, insomuch that their Consuli oppressed with many injuries fled away, and that thou which art Beglerbie didst maintaine the French Consul herein ; whereupon the Embassadour required our commandement, that they might have justice for these injuries : wherefore we command thee that having received this our commandement, you examine diligently that his privilege, and send the copie thereof hither, and if it be found that the French Consuli Vento hath by subtiltie got the aforesaid privilege written, that you then see him punished, and suffer not hereafter the French or Venetian Consuls to intermeddle with their businesse. Obey this our commaundement, and give credite to the seale.
