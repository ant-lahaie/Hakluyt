the perpetuali frustration and revocation of the fore-sayd priviledges, receive any stranger of any other towne in their liberties, by whom the kings custome may in any sort be withholden or diminished: & yet the contrary unto al these provisoes hath bin every yere, for these 20. yeres or thereabout notoriously practised and committed, as well joyntly by the generail counsell, and toleration of the foresayd society, as also severally by the advise and permission of divers particular cities of the foresayd Hans company to the great diminution of his majesties custome, the estimation whereof the foresayd ambassadors are not able at this present fully to declare. But that all occasions of the last above mentioned diminution may bee prevented for the time to come, the sayd ambassadors doe demand to have from How many U’ the foresayd societie a declaration in writing, what and be the

Moreover, it is required by the foresaid ambassadors, if the societie aforesayd hath not decreed nor ordayned the things above written, that the names of the cities and places decreeing and ordaining such statutes & ordinances, may by the sayd common society either now or at some other times and places convenient for the same purpose, be expressed and set downe in writing.

A letter of Henry the fourth king of England &c. unto Frater Conradus de Jungingen the master generali of Prussia.

HEnrie &c. to the most noble and mighty personage of sacred religion Fr: Conradus de Jungingen

Master general of the order of the Dutch knights of S. Marie, our most deare friend, greeting, and continual perfection of amity.

When as your messengers and ambassadors were of late personally present in Holland, and there expected 83

the arrival of our ambassadors untill the first day of the moneth of November last expired, that there might bee by way of friendly conference a remedie provided in regard of certaine injuries pretended to be offered, by both our subjects one against another, for the publique commoditie of both parts, we were determined to have sent unto Dordract, at the foresaid daye, our welbeloved and faithfull knight William Sturmy, and our welbeloved clerke John Kington, upon our ambassage-affayres: having as yet in our desires, for a peaceable ending of the matter, (which, our foresayd ambassadors, by reason of the shortnes of time, or the finding out of some other remedie and happy conclusion of all and singular the foresaid attempts concerning the principali busines, could by no meanes at that instant attaine unto) that upon some other more convenient day (to the end your ambassadors might not returne home altogether frustrate of their expectation) there might be, after the wonted friendly maner, a conference & agreement with your foresayd ambassadors, even as by other letters of ours directed unto your sayd ambassadors the second day of the moneth of November aforesayd wee have delivered our mind unto them. But it fortuned not long before the departure of your ambassadors into their owne countrey, that no sufficient shipping could be found wherein our sayd ambassadors might have secure and safe passage unto Dordract, or Middleburgh, neither was it thought that they should get any passage at all, till the ships at Middleborough were returned into our kingdome, by the force whereof they might be the more strongly wafted over. And so by reason of the departure of your ambassadours, all matters remaine in suspense till such time as the sayd ambassadors shall againe meete with ours to adde perfection unto the busines as yet imperfect. Wherefore (our friend unfainedly beloved) desiring from the bottome of our heart that the integritie of love, which hath from auncient times taken place betweene our & your subjects, may in time to come

also be kept inviolable, we have thought good once again to send one of our foresaid ambassadors, namely William Esturmy knight to Dordract, giving him charge thither to make haste, and there to stay, till some of your messengers, at your commandement doe in time convenient repayre unto that place, there (by Gods assistance) to bring the matter unto an happy conclusion. May it please you therefore of your unfayned friendship, without all inconvenience of delay, to returne, not unto us, but unto our forenamed knight an answere in writing, what your will and determination is. Neither let it seeme strange unto you, that we have not at this present sent our forenamed John Kington clerke together with the sayd William: for the cause of his abode with us is, that he may in the meane season employ his care and diligence about those matters which must be preparatives for the finall conclusion of the foresayd busines. Honorable sir, and most deare friend, we doe most heartily wish increase of prosperity and joy unto your person. Given in our palace of Westminster the 14. day of Feb. in the yeare of our Lord 1407.	1407.

To the right noble and valiant knight Sir [I- 176J William Sturmy sent at this present by the most sovereigne King of England &c. as his ambassadour unto Dordract, his most sincere friend.

HOnorable sir, our most entier friend, wee received the royall letters of the most mighty prince and lord, our lord the king of England and France and lord of Ireland, sent unto us under the date of the 14. day of February (which we received at our castle of Marien-burgh the n. of April) containing, amongst other matters, that his Majesties purpose was once againe to sende one of his ambassadors, namely your selfe our very sincere friend unto Dordract, giving you in charge that you would make haste thither & there stay, untill «5
