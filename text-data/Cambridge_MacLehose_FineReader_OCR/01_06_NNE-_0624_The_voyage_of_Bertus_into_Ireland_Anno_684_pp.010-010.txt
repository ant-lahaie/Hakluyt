The voyage of Bertus, generail of an armie sent into Ireland by Ecfridus king of Northumberland, in the yere of our Lord 684, out of the 4. Booke and 26. Chapter of Beda his Ecclesiastical! Hystorie.

Nno Dominicae incarnationis sexcentesimo octogesimo quarto, Ecfridus rex Nordan-humbrorum, misso Hiberniam cum excer-citu duce Berto, vastavit misere gentem innoxiam, & nationi Anglorum semper amicissimam, ita ut nec ecclesiis quidem aut monasteriis manus parceret hostilis.

At insulani & quantum valuere armis arma repellebant, & invocantes divinae auxilium pietatis coelitus se vindicari continuis diu imprecationibus postulabant. Et quamvis maledici regnum Dei possidere non possint, creditum tamen est, quod hi qui merito impietatis suae maledicebantur, ocyiis Domino vindice, poenas sui reatus luerent.

The same in English.

IN the yeere of our Lord 684, Ecfrid the king of Northumberland sent captaine Bert into Ireland with an armie, which Bert miserably wasted that innocent nation being alwayes most friendly unto the people of England, insomuch that the fury of the enemy spared neither churches nor monasteries. Howbeit the Islanders to their power repelled armes with armes, and craving Gods aid from heaven with continuall imprecations and curses, they pleaded for revenge. And albeit cursed speakers can by no meanes inherit the kingdome of God, it was thought notwithstanding, that they which were accursed for their impiety did not long escape the vengeance of God imminent for their offences.
