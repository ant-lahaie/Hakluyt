'594-barks within the river to such places, where as they have great store of golde. And in all these places hereabouts,	mb tr^e

where we use to trade, they have no Fort, Castle, or ™ place of strength, but onely trading by the Negros safe-	'

conduct and permission. And the most part of the Spaniards and Portugals that be resident in these places be banished men or fugitives, for committing most hainous crimes and incestuous acts, their life & conversation being agreeable; and they are of the basest behaviour that we have ever seene of these nations in any other countrey.

A briefe relation concerning the estate of the cities and provinces of Tombuto and Gago written in Marocco the first of August 1594, and sent to M. Anthony Dassel marchant of London.

Y hearty commendations premised: your letter of late I received, and found that you would have me discover unto you the estate & quality of the countreyes of Tombuto and Gago. And that you may not thinke me to slumber in this action, wherin you would be truely and

perfectly resolved, you shall understand, that not ten dayes past here came a Cahaia of the Andoluzes home from Gago, and another principali Moore, whom the king sent thither at the first with Alcaide Hamode, and they brought with them thirty mules laden with gold. I saw the same come into the Alcasava with mine owne eies: and these men themselves came not poore, but with such wealth, that they came away without the kings commandement: and for that cause the king will pay them no wages for the time they have beene there. On the other side they dare not aske the king for any wages. And when Alcaide Hamode saw that the Cahaia of the Andoluzes would not stay in Gago with him, he thought 99

good to send these thirty mules laden with golde by him, with letters of commendations, by which the king smelled their riches that they brought with them: and this was the cause of the kings displeasure towards them. So now there remaineth in Gago Alcaide Hamode, and Alcaide Jawdara, and Alcaide Bucthare. And here are in a readinesse to depart in the end of this next September Alcaide Monsor, Ben Abdrahaman Allies, Monsor Rico with five thousand men, most of the fettilase, that is to say, of fier-mach, & muskets. There is gone good store of reds & yellowes: and this yere here was want of the same commodity; but I trust the next yere wil be no want. But in fine the king doth prosper wel in those parts, and here are many pledges come hither, and namely three of the kings sonnes of Gago and the Justice; I saw them come in with the treasure. Now when Alcaide Monsor commeth to Gago, the which will be in January next, then returneth hither Alcaide Hamode with all the treasure, and Alcaide Monsor is to keepe Gago untill the king take further order. And thus much for Gago. Thus not having any other thing to write at this present, I commend you to the mercifull tuition of the almighty. From Marocco the first of August 1594.

Your assured friend Laurence Madoc.

Another briefe relation concerning the late conquest and the exceeding great riches of the cities and provinces of Tombuto and Gago, written from Marocco the 30 August 1594, to M. Anthony Dassel marchant of London aforesayd.

Oving friend M. Dassel, two of your letters I have received, one by the shippe called The Amity, the other by The Concord: the chiefest

matter therein was to be satisfied of the king of Marocco his proceedings in Guinea. Therefore these

IOO

are to let you understand that there went with Alcaide Hamode for those parts seventeene hundred men: who passing over the sands, for want of water perished one third part of them: and at their com-ming to the city of Tombuto, the Negros made some Tombuto resistance; but to small purpose, for that they had no iaken‘ defence but with their asagaies or javelings poisoned.

So they tooke it, and proceeded to the city of Gago, Gago taken. where the Negros were in number infinite, and meant to stand to the uttermost for their countrey: but the Moores slew them so fast, that they were faine to yeeld, and do pay tribute by the yere. The rent of [II. ii. 193.] Tombuto is 60 quintals of golde by the yeere; the good-nesse whereof you know. What rent Gago will yeeld, you shall know at the Spring, for then Alcaide Hamode commeth home. The rent of Tombuto is come by the cafelow or carovan, which is, as above is mentioned, 60 quintals. The report is, that Mahomed bringeth with him such an infinite treasure as I never heard of: it doth appeare that they have more golde then any other part of the world beside. The Alcaide winneth all the countrey where he goeth without fighting, and is going downe towards the sea coast. This king of Marocco is like to be the greatest prince in the world for money, if he keepe this countrey. But I make account assoone as the king of Spaine hath quietnesse in Christendome, he wil thrust him out: for that the kings force is not great as yet; but he meaneth to be stronger. There is a campe ready to go now with a viceroy: the speech is with 3000 men: but I thinke they will be hardly 2000; for by report, 3000 men are enough to conquer all the countrey: for they have no defence of importance against an enemy. I thinke Hamode will be returned home in January or thereabout: for he stayeth but for the com-ming of the viceroy. Mulley Balasen the kings sonne of Marocco was slaine in Guinea by his owne men, and they were presently killed, because they should tell no tales. And thus leaving to trouble you, I commit you

IOI

to God, who prosper you in all your proceedings. From Marocco the first of August 1594.

Yours to command for ever Laurence Madoc.
