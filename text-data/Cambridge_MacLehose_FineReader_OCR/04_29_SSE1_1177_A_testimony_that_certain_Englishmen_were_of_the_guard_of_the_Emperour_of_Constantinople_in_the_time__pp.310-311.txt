English men were the guard of the Emperours of Constantinople in the reigne of John the sonne of Alexius Comnenus. Malmes-buriensis, Curopolata and Camden, pag. 96.

Am inde Anglia non minus belli gloria, quam humanitatis cultu inter Florentissimas orbis Christiani gentes inprimis floruit. Adeo ut ad

custodiam corporis Constantinopolitanorum Imperatorum evocati fuerint Angli. Joannes enim Alexii Comneni filius, ut refert noster Malmesburiensis, eorum fidem suspiciens praecipue familiaritati suae applicabat, amorem eorum filio transcribens: Adeo ut jam inde longo tempore fuerint imperatorum illorum satellites, Inglini Bipenniferi Nicetae Choniatae, Barangi Curopolatae dicti. Qui ubique Imperatorem prosequebantur ferentes humeris secures, 310

quas tollebant, cum Imperator ex oratorio spectandum se exhibebat, Anglice vitam diuturnam secures suas collidentes ut sonitum ederent, comprecabantur.

FRom this time forward the kingdome of England was reputed amongst the most flourishing estates of Christendome, no lesse in chivalrie then humanitie. So farforth that the English men were sent for to be the guarders of the persons of the Emperours of Constantinople. For John the sonne of Alexius Comnenus, as our countreyman William of Malmesburie reporteth, highly esteeming their fidelity, used them very nere about him, recommending them over to his sonne: so that long time afterwards the guard of those Emperours were English halberdiers, called by Nicetas Choniata, Inglini Bipenniferi, and by Curopolata, Barangi, which alwayes accompanied the Emperour with their halberds on their shoulders, which they held up when the Emperour com-ming from his Oratorie shewed himselfe to the people; and clashing their halberds together to make a terrible sound, they in the English tongue wished unto him long life.
