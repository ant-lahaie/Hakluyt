And when hee findeth 40 or 45 fadomes, and russet sand, then he must goe Southwest and by South, untill he be in 40 degrees: where hee shall find great store 85

From this place to Puerto de los leones the coast is cleane, and a man may come nigh unto the land:

And it is a lowe land with white cliffes. This harbour is in 44 degrees. And as a man goeth thither, after hee bee in 43 degrees or more, hee must have a care to looke out for certaine small rockes which lie neere the land, and lie North of the harbour.

Julian hath in the entrance certaine high hilles, which afarre off seeme to be towers. On the South part of the entrance the chanell is deepest in the middest: and thou must borrow neerer the North side then to the South. Within the harbour are two Islands: thou must come to an anker hard to them. This haven lyeth in 49 degrees. And betweene Cabo Blanco and this harbour are The Islands of Ascension, and they be eight.

Here is water inough, and thou mayest come to an anker hard aboord the shore, and hast a good defence for a Southwest wind. And the Cape it

And comming out of the mouth thereof a man must keepe himselfe a poynt to the Northward, because there be rocks and shoalds. And if you see beds of weeds, take heed of them, and keepe off from them : and after you be past this Streight you must stirre Westsouthwest 8 leagues unto Cabo de San Gregorio, which is a high white cliffe, and is a good road for any wind from the Northwest to the Southwest. But men must beware and not trust the Indians of this Cape: for they be subtill and will betray a man.

From this Cape beginneth the second Streit which is called Nuestra Sennora de Gracia, and lyeth Eastnortheast and Westsouthwest 3 leagues. And comming out of this Streit thou shalt see 3 little Islands, lying West off" this Streit: thou mayest go betweene them, for there is no danger: provided alwayes that thou keepe well off from the bayes on both sides, lest thou bee imbayed. And from these Islands thou must keepe forwards in the chanell Westsouth west two leagues: and then the coast lyeth North and South unto 53 degrees and a halfe, unto a place called Punta de Santa Anna: and to the Northwest thereof in a corner or nooke (which is one of the rincones or nookes) was the towne builded called La Ciudad del Don Philippe. Thou must come to an anker to the Northward thereof, after thou art past the castle and a great tree.
