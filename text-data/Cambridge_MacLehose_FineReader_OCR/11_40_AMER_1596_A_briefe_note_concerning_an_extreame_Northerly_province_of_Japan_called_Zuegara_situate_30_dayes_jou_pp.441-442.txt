A briefe note concerning an extreme Northerne province of Japan called Zuegara, situate thirtie dayes journey from Miac6, which argueth the Isle of Japan to be of greater extension Northward, then it is ordinarily described in maps, or supposed to be: together with mention of a certaine nation of Tartars called Jeza inhabiting on the maine to the North of China, never heard of in these parts before: taken out of an Epistle written 1596 from Japan by Fryer Luis Frois unto Claudius Aquaviva, &c.
