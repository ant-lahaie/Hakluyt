John Sedgewick at Novogrode.

A Letter of Master Thomas Hawtrey to the worshipfull Master Henrie Lane Agent at Colmogro, written in Vologda the 31. of Januarie 1557.

WOrshipfull Sir, heartie commendations premised.

These may bee to advertise you, that yesterday the thirtieth of this present came hither Robert Best, and brought with him two hundred robles, that is, one hundred for this place, and one hundred for you at Colmogro. As for hempe which is here at two robles and a halfe the bercovite, master Gray hath written to buy no more at that price: for John Sedgewicke hath bought for sixe or seven hundred robles worth at Novogrode for one roble and a halfe the bercovite, and better cheape: and white Novogrode flaxe is there at three robles the bercovite. I trust hee will doe much good by his going thither. As I doe understand, Richard Johnson is gone to Novogrode with money to him, I doubt not but Master Gray hath advertised you of all their doings, both at the Mosco and at Novogrod. And touching our doings heere, you shall perceive that wee have solde wares of this fourth voyage for one hundred and fourtie robles, besides fiftie robles of the second and third voyage since the giving up of my last account, and for wares of the Countrey, you shall understand

392

that I have bought tried and untried for 77. robles foure hundred podes of tried tallowe, besides foure hundred podes that I have given out money for, whereof God graunt good receipt when the time commeth, which is in Lent. And in browne flaxe and hempe I have bought seventeene bercovites, sixe podes and sixteene pound, which cost 28. robles, eleven altines two pence. And as for other kindes of wares I have bought none as yet. And for mastes Masts of 30. to bee provided, you shall understand that I wrote a Jarci!-letter to Totma the 28. of this present for fiftie mastes, to wit, for 25. of fifteene fathoms, and 25. of foure-teene fathoms, to be an arshine and a halfe at the small ende. And more, I have written for 30. great

trees to be two arshines and a halfe at the small end, An Arshine is and for the other that were provided the last yeere, 3- quarters of I trust they shall be sent downe in the spring: of the a^ard,ir yeere. And as concerning the Ropemakers, you shall

understand that their abiding place shall bee with you at A rope house Colmogro, as I doe thinke Master Gray hath advertised erected at you. For, as Roger Bon tinge Master of the woorkes c°lmogro. doeth say, there is no place more meete for their purpose then with you: and there it will be made with lesser cost, considering that the pale is the one halfe of it: which is to set one pale more to that, and so for to cover it over, which as they say, will be but little cost. They doe pray that it may bee made sixe-teene foote broade, and one hundred and eightie fathoms long: and that in the midde way twentie foote from the pale towarde the water side there may

be a house made to tarre in, standing alone by it selfe A tarre house.

for danger of fire. The Tarre house that they woulde have made, is to bee fifteene fathoms long, and ten fathoms broade, and they would that house should be made first: for I thinke they will not tarre before they come there. And farther they desire that you will provide for as much tarre as you may, for heere wee have small store, but when the time commeth that it

393

shoulde be made, I will provide as much as I can here, that it may bee sent downe when the Nasade commeth. The stuffe that they have readie spunne is about five thousand waight, and they say that they trust to have by that time they come downe yarne ynough to make 20. cables. As concerning a copie of the Alphabet in Robert	ciphers Master Gray hath written hither that Robert

Austen.	Austen had one, which he willed that he shoulde deliver

to you. Thus I surcease, beseeching God to preserve you in health, and to send you your hearts desire.

By yours to command to his power, Thomas Hawtrey.

[I. 303.] A Letter of Master Richard Gray one of the first Agents of the Moscovie companie to Master Henrie Lane at Mosco, written in i558-	Colmogro the 19. of Februarie 1558.

WOrshipfull Sir, after heartie commendations &c.

You shall understand that this Lent commeth Lampas a to Lampas such a number of men of divers nations great mart fir w£th wareS} as hath not bene seene these ten yeeres. tk^North Thither come many out of Ugori : therefore I would have bene there my selfe, and also have received such money as is owing us in wares by Kerill his brother and Osep Boscovo. For as you well know, thence they will goe with their wares to the Mosco, and make us payment with delayes, as they have done these other yeeres past. Colobone and his partner be departed towards Lampas with seven sleddes laden with victuals. Others also are gone to that Mart. As touching the bringing of money with you, it will bee good, for I assure you since our comming to this countrey have not so many persons gone to the Sea, as will doe this yeere. Trusting that God will send good store of traine oyle, I will cause as much caske to bee in a readinesse as I can, if you shall thinke it meete to send some money before. All
