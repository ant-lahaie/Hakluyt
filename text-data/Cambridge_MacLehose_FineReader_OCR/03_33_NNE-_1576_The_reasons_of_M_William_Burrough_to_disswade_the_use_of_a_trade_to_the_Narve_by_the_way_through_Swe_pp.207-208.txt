Certaine reasons to disswade the use of a trade to the Narve aforesaide, by way through Sweden.

THe merchandise of the Narve are grosse wares, viz. flaxe, hempe, waxe, tallow and hides.

The traffique at that place standeth upon the agreement and liking of the Emperour of Russia, with the king of Sweden : for all these merchandises that are brought thither come from Plescove, Novogrod, and other parts of the Emperours dominions.

For transporting those merchandises from Narve to Stockholm, or what other place shall bee thought convenient in Sweden, it must be in vessels of those countries, which wilbe of smal force to resist Freebooters, or any other that shall make quarel or offer violence against them.

When the goods are brought into Sweden, they must be discharged, and new laden into smaller vessels, to cary the same by river or lake a part of the way, and againe to be unladen and transported by land to Newles.

So as the ordinary charges for transporting of goods from Narve to Newles by way as aforesaid, besides the spoile by so often lading and unlading, cariage by land, and the dangers of the seas, pirats, &c. will be such as when it shalbe so brought to Newles it wil be as deare to the merchants in that place as it shall be worth to be sold in London, wherefore the trade that wayes cannot be profitable to our nation.

Moreover, when the goods shall be in Newles, it may Note. bee thought doubtfull to bring it thence quietly without disliking or forcible resistance of the king of Denmarke, forasmuch as he maketh quarell, and alleageth damage unto him in his toiles of the Sound by our trade to S. Nicholas, how much more will he now doe by this way, and with how much greater advantage may he

performe it ? The danger that may grow in our trade to Russia by way of S. Nicholas, through the displeasure that the Emperour may conceive by our trade with the Sweden to Narve is also to be considered.

A remembrance of advise given to the merchants, touching a voyage for Cola abovesaid. 1578.

WHereas you require my counsell after what order the voyage for Cola is to be set forth, I answere that I know no better way then hath bene heretofore used, which is after this maner. First of all we have hired the ship by the great, giving so much for the wearing of the tackle and the hull of the shippe, as the ship may be in bignesse : as if shee bee about the burden of an hundred tunnes, we pay fourescore pound, and so after that rate : and thereunto we doe victual the ship our selves, and doe ship all our men our selves, shipping no more men, nor giving them more wages then we should doe if they went of a merchants voyage, for it hath bene a great helpe to our voiage hitherto, to have our men to fish with one boate, & costing us no more charges then it should do, if our men should lie & doe nothing saving the charges of salt, & of lines, which is treble paid for againe. For this last yere past our men killed with one boat betwixt 9. or 10. thousand fish, which yeelded to us in money with the oile that came of it, about 15. or 16. score pounds, which is a great helpe to a voyage. And besides al this, our ship did take in so much oile and other commodities as we bestowed 100. whole clothes in. But because, as I doe suppose, it is not the use of London to take ships to fraight after that order before prescribed, neither I think that the mariners wil take such paines as our men will: Therefore my counsell is, if you thinke good, to freight some ship of Hui or Newcastle, for I am sure that you may have them there better cheap to freight, then here at London. Besides al this, one may have such men as wil take paines for their merchants. And
