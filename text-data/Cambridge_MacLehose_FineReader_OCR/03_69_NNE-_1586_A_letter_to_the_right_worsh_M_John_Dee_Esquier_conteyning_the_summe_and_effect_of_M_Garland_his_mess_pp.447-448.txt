Witnesse M. Edward Kelley, and M. Francis Garland, brother to the foresaid Edward, and divers others.

IT seemeth that this princely offer of the Emperour Pheodor Ivanowich, and of the L. Boris Pheodorowich Protectour to his Majestie, was made unto the learned and famous Mathematitian M. John Dee, partly to use his counsell & direction about certaine discoveries to the Northeast; and partly for some other weighty occasions : but because their conquest to Siberia was not as then fully settled, & for divers other secret reasons, it was for yâ€˜ time with al thankfulnes refused.

A branch of a letter from M. John Merick, Agent unto the Moscovie company in Russia, closed up in the Mosco the 14. of March, Anno 1597. touching the death of Pheodor Ivanowich late Emperour of all Russia, &c.

1597-

Aving thus farre proceeded with this my answere unto the chiefest points of your worships letters received, my desire was to have sent one unto you long since, as you may perceive by || the first date : but by reason I could not get leave, I have deferred it of till this instant, for

that there was none suffered to passe out of the land. The causes may be judged, for that it pleased God to call out of this world, the Emperour his Majestie, who departed about the 7. of January: and ever since hath bene a mourning time, & no suites for any matter could be heard. But it hath bene a very dead season. Yet (thankes be to God) through the wise government of Lord Boris Pheodorowich the Lord Protector
