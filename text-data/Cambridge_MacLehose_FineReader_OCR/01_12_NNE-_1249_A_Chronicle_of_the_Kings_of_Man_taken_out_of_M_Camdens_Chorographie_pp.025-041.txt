IO66.

A Chronicle of the Kings of Man, taken out of M. Camdens Chorographie.

N the yeere of our Lord 1066. Edward King of England, of famous memory deceased, whom Harald sonne of Godwin succeeded in his kingdome; against which Harald the king of Norwaie called Harald Harfager fought a battel at Stainford bridge, where the English winning the

fielde put all the Norwegians to flight: out of which flight one Godredus sirnamed Crovan (the sonne of Harald the blacke, who had before time fled out of Island) repaired unto Godred sonne of Syrric, who then reigned in Man, and was right friendly and honourably enterteined by him.

In the very same yeere William the Conquerour subdued England, and Godred the sonne of Syrric, king of Man, deceased, after whom succeeded his sonne Fingal. Fingal.

In the yeere 1066. Godredus Crovan gathered a fleete of ships, and sailed unto Man, and giving battell unto the people of the countrey, was vanquished and put to flight. The second time also having gathered his armie and ships together, hee came unto Man, fought with the inhabitants, lost the victorie, and was chaced away. Yea, the third time he assembled a great multitude, and comming by night unto the port which is called Ramsa, hid 300. of his men in a wood standing upon the side of the hill called Scacafel. The Sunne was no sooner up, but the Mannians arranged themselves and with great furie set upon Godred.

Boats having not past three yron nailes in them.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

And in the midst of the skirmish, the foresaid 300. men rising out of their ambush, and comming upon the backes of the Mannians, molested them so sore, that they were enforced to flie. But when they saw y' they were overcome and had no place of refuge to retire unto (for the tide of the sea had filled the chanel of the river of Ramsa) and seeing the enemie so fiercely pursuing them on the other side, they which remained, with lamentable outcries beseeched Godred to spare their lives. Then hee being mooved with compassion, and pitying their extreme calamitie, because hee had bene of late sustained and nourished among them, sounded a retreat and forbad his souldiers to make any longer pursuit. The day following Godred put his souldiers to their choice, whether they would divide Man among themselves and inhabite it, or whether they would take the wealth of the countrey, and so returne unto their owne home. Howbeit, it pleased them better to waste the whole Island and to enrich themselves with the commodities thereof, and so to returne from whence they came. Nowe Godred himselfe with a fewe Islanders which had remained with him, tooke possession of the South part of the Island, and unto the remnant of the Mannians he granted the North part thereof, upon condition, that none of them should at any time afterward dare once to chalenge any parcell of the said ground by title of inheritance. Whereupon it com-meth to passe, that unto this day the whole Island is the kings owne Fee-simple, and that all the revenues thereof pertaine unto him. Also Godredus subdued Dublin unto himselfe & a great part of Lainestir. And he so tamed the Scots, that none of them durst build a ship or a boate, with above three yron nailes in it. Hee reigned 16. yeeres and died in the Island called Yle. He left behinde him three sonnes, Lagman, Harald, and Olavus. Lagman being the eldest chalenged the kingdome and reigned seven yeeres. Howbeit Harald his brother rebelled against him a long time, but being at length taken by Lagman, hee was gelt and had his eyes put out. After-26

ward Lagman repenting him that he had put out the eyes of his brother, did of his owne accord relinquish his kingdome, and taking upon him the badge of the crosse, he went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in which journey also he died.

In the yeere 1075. all the principali men of the Islands having intelligence of the death of Lagman, sent messengers unto Murecardus O-Brien King of Irland, requesting him that hee would send some wel-disposed person of his owne kinred and blood royall, untill Olavus sonne of Godred were come to full age. The king most willingly [I. 11 .J condescended unto their request, and sent unto them one Dopnald the sonne of Tade, charging and commaunding him that with all meekenesse and modestie, hee should governe that kingdome, which of right belonged not unto him. Howbeit he, after he had once attained unto the kingdome, neglecting the commaundement of his lord, usurped the government with great tyrannic, committing many heinous crimes, and so he reigned very disorderly for the space of three yeeres. Then all the princes of the Islands making a generail conspiracie, banded themselves against him, and expelled him out of their dominions. And he flying into Irland returned no more unto them.

In the yeere 1077. one Ingemundus was sent from the king of Norway, to take possession of the kingdome of the Islands. And being come unto the Island of Leodus, Lewis. hee sent messengers unto all the princes of the Islands to come unto him, commaunding them to assemble themselves, and to appoint him to be their King. In the meane season he and his companions spent their time in robbing and rioting, ravished women and virgines, and addicted themselves to filthy pleasures and to the lustes of the flesh. And when these things were reported unto the princes of the Islands, who had assembled themselves to chuse him king, being mightely incensed thereat, they made haste towards him, and comming upon him in the night, they burnt the house wherein hee was, and slue

both him and the rest of his company, partly with sword, and partly with fire.

In the yeere 1098. the abbey of S. Maries at Cistertium was founded. In the same yeere also Antiochia was taken by the Christians, and a Comet appeared.

Moreover, the same yeere there was a battel fought betweene the inhabitants of Man, at Santwat, and they of the North obtained the victory. In which battell were slaine Earle Othor and Mac-Maras, chieftaines of both parts.

The same yeere Magnus king of Norway, sonne of Olavus, sonne of Harald Harfagre, being desirous to view the corps of S. Olavus king and Martyr, gave com-maundement that his monument should be opened. But the Bishop and the Clergie withstanding this his attempt, the king went very boldly and by his kingly authoritie, caused the cophin' to be opened. And when hee had seene with his eyes, and handled with his hands the incorrupt body of the foresaid King and Martyr, a sudden feare came upon him, and he departed with great haste. The night following Olavus king and Martyr appeared unto him in a vision, saying: Chuse (I say) unto your selfe one of these two, either within 30. dayes to lose your life with your kingdome, or else to depart from Norway and never to see it againe. The King so soone as he was awaked out of sleepe, called his Princes and Senatours, and expounded the foresaide vision unto them. And they also being astonished thereat gave him this counsell, that with all speed he should depart out of Norway. Then he without any further delay caused a Navie of 160. ships to be provided, and so sailed unto the Islands of Orkney, which hee presently subdued, and passing along through all the Islands and conquering them, at length he came unto the Isle of Man, where he was no sooner arrived, but hee went unto the Isle of S. Patric to see the place of battell, where the inhabitants of Man had of late fought, because many of the dead bodies were as yet unburied. And seeing that it was a 28

most beautifull Island, it pleased him exceeding well, and therefore hee made choice to inhabite therein his owne selfe, and built forts there which are at this day called by his owne name. He had the people of Galway in such awe, that he constrained them to cut downe their owne timber, and to bring it unto his shore for the building of his fortes. Hee sailed on further unto the Isle of Anglesey neere unto Wales, and finding two Earles therein (either of them being called by the name of Hugo) he slue the one, and the other hee put to flight, and so subdued the Island. But the Welshmen presented many gifts unto him, and so bidding them farewell he returned unto Man. Unto Murecard king of Irland he sent his shooes, commaunding him that he should cary them on his shoulders, upon the birth-day of our Lord through the midst of his Palace, in the sight of his Embassadours, that thereby it might appeare unto them, that he was subject unto king Magnus. Which when the Irishmen heard, they tooke it grievously and disdeined much thereat. But the King being better advised, I had rather (said he) not only beare his shooes, but eate his shooes, then that king Magnus should destroy any one province in Irland. Wherefore he fulfilled his commaundement, and honourably enterteined his Embassadours. Many gifts also he sent unto king Magnus by them, and concluded a league. But the messengers returning unto their lord, tolde him of the situation of Irland, of the beautie thereof, of the fruitfulnesse of the soile, and of the holesomnesse of the aire. Magnus hearing these things was fully resolved to conquer all Irland unto himselfe. And for the same purpose he commaunded that a Fleet should be made ready. But he taking his voyage with sixteene ships, & being desirous to view the land, when he had undiscreetly departed from his Navie, he was suddenly invironed by the Irish, and was himselfe slaine, together with all that were with him almost. Hee was interred neere unto the Church of S. Patric in Armagh. Hee sixe yeeres. After his death the Princes of the 29

A.D.

1098.

[I. 12.] Islands sent for Olavus the sonne of Godredus Crovan, who lived in the Court of Henry King of England son unto William the Conquerour.

In the yeere 1102. Olavus sonne of Godredus Crovan beganne his reigne and reigned fourtie yeeres : he was a peaceable man being in league with all the Kings of Scotland and Irland in his time. He tooke to wife Affrica the daughter of Fergusius of Galway, of whom he begat Godredus. Of his concubines he begat Regnaldus, Lagmannus, and Haraldus, and many daughters, whereof || Argile, one married unto Sumerledus king of II Herergaidel, which afterward occasioned the overthrow of the whole kingdome of the Islands. He begat foure sonnes by her, namely Dulgallus, Raignaldus, Engus, and Olavus.

In the yeere 1134. Olavus gave unto Yvo the Abbat of Furnes a portion of his owne ground in Man to build an Abbey in the place which is called Russin. Also hee inriched with revenues and indued with priviledges al places of religion within his Islands.

In the yere 1142. Godredus ye son of Olavus sailed unto the K. of Norway called Hinge, and doing his homage unto him he remained with him, & was by him honorably enterteined. The same yere the 3. sonnes of Harald brother unto Olavus, who were brought up at the citie of Dublin, gathering together a great multitude of people, and all the fugitives and vagabonds of the kingdome resorted unto Man, and demaunded of the said king the one halfe of al the kingdome of the Islands. Which thing when the king heard, being desirous to pacific them, he answered that he would consult about that matter. And a day and place being appointed, where the consultation should bee kept, in the meane time those miscreants conspired together, about the murthering of the King. And when the day appointed was come, both companies assembled themselves unto the haven towne called Ramsa, and they sate in order, the king with his nobilitie on the one side, and they with their confederates on the other side. Howbeit Regnaldus who had an

intention to slay the king, stoode a-side in the midst of the house talking with one of the Princes of the lande. And being called to come unto the king he turned himselfe about as if hee would have saluted him, and lifting up his glittering axe, he chopt the kings head quite off at a blow. Nowe 1143 • having committed this outragious vilanie, within a short space they divided the Island betweene themselves, and gathering an armie together sailed unto Galway, intending to subdue that also; howbeit the people of Galway assembled themselves, and with great furie encountred with them. Then they immediately turning their backs with great confusion fled unto Man. And as touching all the Galwedians which inhabited in the said Island, some of them they slue, and the residue they banished.

In the yeere 1143. Godredus sonne of Olavus returning out of Norway was created king of Man; who in revenge of his fathers death, put out the eyes of two of Haralds sonnes and slue the thirde.

In the yeere 1144. Godredus began his reigne, and hee reigned thirtie yeeres. In the thirde yeere of his reigne the citizens of Dublin sent for him and created him king of Dublin, against whom Murecardus king of Irland made warre, and encamping himselfe at the citie called Coridelis, he sent his brother Osibel with 3000. horsemen unto Dublin, who was slaine by Godred and the Dubliners, the rest of his company being put to flight. These things being thus finished, Godredus returned unto Man, and began to exercise tyrannic, disinheriting certaine of his nobles, of whom one called Thorfinus the sonne of Oter, being mightier then the rest, went unto Sumerledus, and named Dubgal the sonne of Sumerledus, king of the Islands, and subdued many of the said Islands on his behalfe. Whereof when Godred had intelligence by one Paulus, providing a Navie, hee went to meete Sumerledus comming against him with 80. ships: and in the yeere 1156. upon the night of the feast of Epiphanie, there was 1156. a Sea-battell fought, and many being slaine on both parts, the day folowing they were pacified, and divided the

kingdome of the Islands among themselves, and it continued two kingdomes from that day unto this present time. And this was the cause of the ruine of the monarchic of the Islands, from which time the sonnes of Sumerled injoyed the one halfe thereof.

In the yeere 1158. Sumerled came unto Man with 53. ships, putting Godred to flight and wasting the Island: and Godred sailed unto Norway to seeke for aide against Sumerled. In the yere 1164. Sumerled gathered a fleete of 160. ships together; and arrived at Rhinfrin, intending to subdue all Scotland unto himselfe: howbeit, by Gods just judgement being overcome by a few, together with his sonne, and an innumerable multitude of people, he was slaine. The very same yere there was a battel fought at Ramsa, betweene Reginald the brother of Godred, and the inhabitants of Man, but by the stratageme of a certaine Earle the Mannians were put to flight. Then began Reginald to usurpe the kingly authoritie. Howbeit his brother Godred within foure dayes after, comming out of Norway with a great power of armed men, apprehended his brother Reginald, gelt him, and put out his eyes. The same yeere deceased [I. 13.] Malcolme the king of Scots, and his brother William succeeded in the kingdome.

In the yeere 1166. two Comets appeared in the moneth of August, before the rising of the Sunne, one to the South and another to the North.

In the yeere 1171. Richard earle of Penbroke sailed into Irland, and subdued Dublin with a great part of Irland.

In the yere 1176. John Curcy conquered Ulster unto himselfe. And at the same time also Vivianus legate from the sea of Rome came into Man, & caused king Godred to bee lawfully wedded unto his wife Phingola, daughter of Maclotlen son of Murkartac king of Irland, mother of Olavus, who was then 3. yeeres old. Silvanus the abbat married them, unto whom the very same day, king Godred gave a portion of ground in Mirescoge, where he 32

built a Monastery : howbeit, in processe of time, the said land with the monkes, was granted unto the abbey of Russin.

In the yere 1172. Reginaldus the son of Eacmarcat (a man descended of the blood royal) comming into Man with a great multitude of people, in the absence of the king, at the first conflict hee put to flight certaine watchmen which kept the shoare, & slue about 30. persons. Whereupon the very same day the Mannians arranging themselves put him, & almost al his folowers to the sword.

In the yere 1183. O-Fogolt was vicount of Man.

In the yere 1185. the Sunne was ecclipsed upon the feast of S. Philip and Jacob.

In the yere 1187. deceased Godred king of the Islands, upon the 4. of the Ides of November, and the next sommer his body was translated unto the island of Hy. He left 3. sonnes behinde him, Reginaldus, Olavus, and Yvarus. In his life time he ordeined his sonne Olavus to be his heire apparant, because he onely was borne legitimate. But the Mannians, when Olavus was scarce ten yeeres olde, sent unto the islands for Reginald and created him king.

In the yeere 1187. began Reginald the sonne of Godred to reigne over the islands : and Murchardus a man of great power throughout all the kingdome of the islands was put to death.

In the yere 1192. there was a battel fought betweene Reginald and Engus the two sonnes of Sumerled : but Engus obtained the victory. The same yere was the abbey of Russin remooved unto Dufglas, howbeit within foure yeeres after the monkes returned unto Russin.

In the yere 1203. Michael bishop of the islands deceased at Fontanas, and Nicholas succeeded in his roome.

In the yere 1204. Hugo de Lacy invaded Ulster with an armie and encountered with John de Curcy, tooke him prisoner & subdued Ulster unto himselfe. Afterward he permitted the said John to goe at libertie, who comming unto king Reginald was honourably enterteined by him, i	33	c

King John passed into Irland with 500. sailes.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

because he was his sonne in lawe, for John de Curcy had taken to wife Affrica the daughter of Godredus, which founded the abbey of S. Mary de jugo domini, and was there buried.

In the yeere 1205. John de Curcy & Reginald king of the islands invading Ulster with a hundreth ships at the port which is called Stranfeord did negligently besiege the castle of Rath : but Walter de Lacy comming upon them with his armie, put them to flight, & from that time Curcy never recovered his land. In the yere 1210. Engus the son of Sumerled & his 3. sonnes were slaine.

At the same time John king of England conducted a fleet of 500. ships into Irland, and subdued it unto himselfe : and sending a certaine earle named Fulco, unto the isle of Man, his souldiers almost utterly wasted it in the space of 15. dayes, and having taken pledges they returned home into their owne countrey. King Reginald and his nobles were at this time absent from Man.

In the yere 1217. deceased Nicolas bishop of the islands, and was buried in Ulster, in the house of Benchor, whom Reginald succeeded.

I thinke it not amisse to report somewhat more concerning the two foresaid brethren Reginaldus and Olavus.

REginald gave unto his brother Olavus, the island called Lodhus or Lewes, which is saide to be larger then the rest of the islands, but almost destitute of inhabitants, because it is so ful of mountaines & quarreis, being almost no where fit for tillage. Howbeit the inhabitants thereof do live for the most part upon hunting and fishing. Olavus therefore went to take possession of this Island, and dwelt therein leading a poore life : and when he saw that it would by no meanes suffice for the sustentation of himselfe & his folowers, hee went boldly unto his brother Reginald, who as then remained in the islands, & spake on this wise unto him. My brother (Said he) and my lord and king, you know that the

1223-kingdom of the islands pertained unto me by right of inheritance, howbeit because the Lord had chosen you to beare the scepter, I doe not envie that honour unto you, neither doeth it any whit grieve mee that you are exalted unto this royall dignitie. Nowe therefore I beseech you to provide mee some portion of land in the islands, whereby I may honestly live. For the Island of Lewis [I. 14.] which you gave me is not sufficient for my maintenance. Which his brother Reginald hearing said that he would consult about the premisses. And on the morow, when Olavus was sent for to parle, Reginald commanded him to be attached, and to be caried unto William king of Scotland, and with him to remaine prisoner : and Olavus remained in prison almost for the space of 7. yeres. But at the 7. yeres end William king of Scots deceased, and Alexander his sonne reigned in his stead. The foresaid William, before his death, commanded that all prisoners should be set at libertie. Olavus therefore being at libertie came unto Man, and immediatly with a great company of nobles tooke his journey unto S. James : and his brother Reginald caused the said Olavus to take unto wife, the daughter of a certaine noble man of Kentyre, cousine german unto his owne wife, & by name being called Lavon, and he granted unto him the possession of Lewis. After a few dayes Reginald the bishop of the Islands having gathered a Synod, separated Olavus and Godred his sonne, and Lavon his wife, namely because shee was cousin german unto his former wife. Afterward Olavus maried Scristina daughter unto Ferkarus earle of Rosse.

Hereupon the wife of Reginald Queene of the Islands being incensed, sent letters unto the Island of Sky in K. Reginald his name to her sonne Godred willing him to take Olavus. Which commandement Godred putting in practise, & entring the isle of Lewis for ye same purpose, Olavus fled in a litle skiffe unto his father in law the earle of Rosse, & in the meane time Godred wasted the isle of Lewis. At the very same time Pol the son of Boke 35

The Isle of Man ad-vaunced to a kingdome.

vicount of Sky, being a man of power in al the Islands, because he would not consent unto Godred, fled, & dwelt together with Olavus in the dominions of the earle of Rosse, & making a league with Olavus, they went both in a ship unto Sky. To be short, sending certaine spies, they were informed that Godred remained secure with a smal company in a certaine Isle called ye isle of S. Columba. And uniting unto themselves their friends and acquaintance, & others that would goe voluntarily with them, in the dead of the night, having lanched 5. ships from the next sea-shore, which was distant about the space of 2. furlongs from the foresaid Island, they environed the said Island on all sides. Now Godred and his company rising early in the morning, and seeing themselves beset with their enemies on all sides, they were utterly astonied. Howbeit arming themselves they began stoutly to make resistance, but altogether in vaine. For about 9. of the clocke in the morning, Olavus and the foresaid vicount Pol, with al their souldiers, entred the Island, and having slaine all whom they found without the precincts of the Church, they apprehended Godred, gelding him, and putting out his eyes. Unto which action Olavus gave not his consent, neither could he withstand it, by reason of the forenamed vicount the son of Boke. This was done in the yere of Christ 1223. The next sommer folowing Olavus having received pledges from all the chiefe men of the Islands, with a fleet of 32. ships sailed unto Man, and arrived at Rognolfwaht. At the same time Reginald and Olavus divided the kingdome of the Islands betweene themselves, Man being granted unto Reginald, & besides his portion the name of a king also. Olavus having received certaine victuals of the people of Man, returned, together with his company, unto his owne portion of Islands. The yeere folowing Reginald taking unto him Alanus lord of Galway, together with his subjects of Man, sailed unto the Islands, that hee might take away that portion of ground from his brother Olavus, which he had granted unto him, and subdue it unto himselfe. How-

1228., beit, by reason that the people of Man had no list to fight against Olavus or the Islanders, because they bare good will towards them, Reginald and Alanus lord of Galway being defeated of their purpose, returned home unto their owne. Within a short space after Reginald, under pretense of going unto the Court of his lord the king of England, received an 100. markes of the people of Man, and tooke his journey unto Alanus lord of Galway. Which the people of Man hearing tooke great indignation thereat, insomuch that they sent for Olavus, and appointed him to be their king.

In the yeere 1226. Olavus recovered his inheritance, that is to say the kingdome of Man and of the Islands, which Reginald his brother had governed for the space of 38. yeeres, and he reigned two yeeres in safetie.

In the yeere 1228. Olavus with all his nobles of Man, and the stronger part of his people, sailed unto the Islands. A short space after Alanus lord of Galway, Thomas earle of Athol, & king Reginald came unto Man with a mightie army, and wasted all the South part of Man, spoiled the Churches, and slue all the men whom they coulde take, insomuch, that the South part of the saide Island was brought almost into desolation. And then Alanus returned with his army into his owne land, leaving behind him bailiffes and substitutes in Man, which should gather up and render unto him the tribute of the countrey. Howbeit king Olavus came suddenly upon them, chaced them away and recovered his kingdome. And the Mannians which of late were dispersed and scattered abroad, began to unite themselves, and to inhabite without feare. The same yeere, in the time of Winter, upon the sudden, and in the very dead of the night came king Reginald out of Galway with five ships, and burnt all [I. 15.] the ships of his brother Olavus, and of the nobles of Man, at the Isle of S. Patric, & concluding a peace with his brother, remained at the port of Ragnolwath 40. dayes : in the meane while hee allured unto himselfe all the Islanders upon the South part of Man, who sware, that

they would adventure their lives, untill hee had gotten the one halfe of his kingdome : contrarywise Olavus joyned unto himselfe them of the North part, & upon the 14. of February in the place called Tingvalla, a field was fought betweene the two brothers, wherein Olavus got the victory, and Reginald the king was by certaine souldiers slaine without the knowledge of his brother. Also certaine pirates comming to the south part of Man, wasted & spoiled it. The monkes of Russin conveyed the body of K. Reginald, unto the abbey of S. Mary of Fournes, & there he was interred in the place, which his owne selfe had chosen for the purpose. After these things Olavus travelled unto the king of Norway, but before he was arrived there, Haco king of Norway appointed acertaine noble man named Husbac the son of Owmund, to be king of the Islands of the Hebrides & called his name Haco. Then came the said Haco with Olavus & Godred Don the son of Reginald, and a multitude of Norwegians, unto the islands: and while they were giving an assault unto a castle in the island of Both, Haco being hit with a stone died, and was buried in Iona.

In the yere 1230. came Olavus, with Godredus Don, & certeine Norwegians unto Man, and they parted the kingdome among themselves, Olavus stil reteining Man. Godred as he was going unto the islands, was slaine in the isle of Lewis, & Olavus injoyed the kingdome of the islands also.

In the yere 1237. upon the 12. of the Kalends of June, Olavus sonne of Godred king of Man deceased in the isle of S. Patric, and was interred in the abbey of Russin. He reigned 11. yeres, two while his brother was alive, and nine after his death.

Haraldus his sonne being of the age of 14. yeres, succeeded, and he reigned 12. yeeres. The first yere of his reigne taking his journey unto the islands, he appointed one Loglen his kinsman to be his deputie in Man. The Autumne folowing Haraldus sent the three sonnes of Nel, namely Dufgaldus, Torquellus, & Molmore, and his friend 3»

Joseph unto Man, that they might enter into consultation together. Wherfore the 25. day they assembled themselves at Tingvalla : and malice growing betweene the sonnes of Nel, and Loglen, they fel to blowes and skirmished sore on both parts, Molmore, Dufgald, and the foresaid Joseph being all slaine in the fray. The Spring folowing, king Harald came into the isle of Man, and Loglen fleeing into Wales, was himselfe, together with Godred the sonne of Olavus his pupil, and 40. others, drowned by shipwracke.

In the yere 1238. Gospatricius and Gillescrist sonne of Mac-Kerthac came from the king of Norway unto Man, expelling Harald out of the said island, and taking tribute on the behalfe of the Norwegian king, because the said Harald refused to come unto his Court.

In the yere 1240. Gospatricius deceased and was buried in the abbey of Russin.

In the yere 1239. Haraldus went unto the king of Norway, who within two yeres confirmed unto him, his heires and successors, under seale, all the islands which his predecessors enjoyed.

In the yeere 1242. Haraldus returned out of Norway unto Man, and being honourably received by the inhabitants, he lived in peace with the kings of England and Scotland.

In the yeere 1247. Haraldus (like as his father also before him) was knighted by the king of England, and so being rewarded with many gifts, he returned home. The same yere he was sent for by the king of Norway, and he maried his daughter. And in the yere 1249. as he was returning home with his wife, with Laurence the elect of Man, and with many other nobles, neere unto the confines of Radland, he was drowned in a tempest.

In the yere 1249. Reginald the sonne of Olavus, and brother unto Harald began to reigne the day next before the Nones of May : and upon the 30. day of the same moneth he was slaine by Yvarus a souldier, and other of his complices, in the South part of a certaine medow,

X249.

neere unto the Church of the holy Trinitie, and he was buried at the Church of S. Marie at Russin.

The same yere Alexander king of Scots provided a great navie of ships, that he might conquere the islands unto himselfe : howbeit falling into an ague at the isle of Ker-wary, he deceased.

Then Haraldus the sonne of Godred Don usurped the name of a king over the islands, hee banished also all the princes of Harald the sonne of Olavus, and ordeined his fugitives to bee princes and nobles in their stead.

In the yere 1250. Haraldus the son of Godred Don being summoned by letters went unto the king of Norway, who deteined him in prison because he had unjustly possessed the kingdome. The same yeere Magnus the sonne of Olavus, and John the sonne of Dugalt arrived at Roghalwaht, which John named himselfe king, but the Mannians taking it grievously, that Magnus was not nominated, drave them from their shoare, and many of the company perished by shipwracke.

In the yeere 1252. came Magnus the sonne of Olavus unto Man, and was ordeined king. The yere folowing he tooke his journey unto the king of Norway, & there he remained one whole yere.

In the yeere 1254. Haco king of Norway ordeined Magnus the sonne of Olavus king of the Islands, confirming them to him and to his heires, and by name unto Harald his brother.

In the yere 1256. Magnus tooke his journey into England, and was by the king of England created knight.
