Ego autem imprimis diligentem operam & fidele studium & nunc eodem confirmando navavi, & in futurum quoque usque in ultimum vitae spiritum in negotiis potentissimi & invictissimi Caesaris, & vestrae sacrae Regiae Majestatis egregiam navabo operam. Quod Deus omnipotens ad emolumentum & utilitatem utriilsque Reipublicae secundet. Arnen. Sacram Regiam Majestatem foelicissime valere exopto. Datum Constantinopoli anno 1583, die octavo Maii.
