TESTIMONIES OF THE AMAZON broad and as much beaten, as the wayes betweene Salamanca and Validolid: and this was when the great entrance or discoverie was made by the great river of the Amazones or Marannon by Pedro de Orsua, and afterwardes by others that succeeded him: and they supposing that Dorado which they sought, was farther up in the countrey, did not inhabite there, and afterward returned without discovering Dorado (which they never found) and without that great province which they left.

A short description of the river of Marannon or Amazones, and the Countries thereabout, as also of the sea of Fresh-water, taken out of an ancient Discourse of all the Portes, Creekes, and Havens of the West Indies, Written by Martin Fernandez de Enciza, and dedicated to Charles the Emperour, Anno 1518.

Arannon lyeth in seven degrees and an halfe Northward of the Equinoctial, it is a great river, and hath more then fifteene leagues in bredth eight leagues within the land. It hath many islands, and in this river within the land fortie leagues there is neere to the sayde river

a mountaine, whereupon growe trees of Incense, the trees be of a good height, & the boughs thereof be like to Plumtrees, and the Incense doeth hang at them, as the yce doeth at the tiles of a house in the winter season when it doeth freeze. In this river were taken foure Indians in a smal boat, called in the Indian language a Canoa, that came downe by the river, and there were taken from them two stones of Emeralds, the one of them being as great as a mans hand. They sayd that so many dayes journey going upward by the river, they found a rocke of that stone. Likewise there were taken from them two loaves made of floure, which were like to cakes of Sope, and it seemed that

they were kneaded with the licour of Balsamum. All this coast from the Cape of S. Austine unto Marannon is a cleare coast & deep, but neer to the river are certaine sholds towardes the East part. And by the West part the river is deepe, and it hath a good entrie. From this river Marannon, unto the river which is called The sea of fresh water, are 25 leagues: this river hath 40 leagues of bredth at the mouth, and carieth such abundance of water that it entreth more then 20 leagues into the Sea, and mingleth not it selfe with the salt water: this bredth goeth 25 leagues within the land, and after it is devided into partes, the one going towards the Southeast, and the other towards the Southwest. That which goeth towards the Southeast is very deepe and of much water, and hath a chanel half a league of bredth, that a Carack may goe up through it: & the tydes be so swift, that the ships have need of good cables. The river of this port is very good, and there have bene some that have entred 50 leagues within it, & have seene no moun-taines. The Indians of this countrey have their lips made full of small holes in 4 parts, & through those holes be put small rings, and likewise at their eares: & if any man aske of them where they had their gold, they answere, that going up by the river so many dayes journey, they found certaine mountaines that had much of it, and from those mountaines they brought it when they would have it, but they made no great account of it, for they neither buy nor sell, and amongst them is nothing but change. In this countery they eate bread of rootes, and Maiz, and they eate certaine rootes which they call Aies and Batatas, but the Batatas bee better then the other rootes, and being rawe they have a smell of Chestnuts: they are to be eaten rosted. These Indians doe make wine of the fruit of Date-trees, which fruit is yellow in colour, and is as great as a little Doves egge, and being in season is good to be eaten, and of it proceedeth good wine, and is preserved

for a long time. These kinde of people do make their houses with upper roomes, and they sleepe in them, as also al their habitation is in the upper roomes, and that which is belowe, they leave open: and also they use certaine mantels of cotten wooll, and these they tie at the endes with ropes, and the one ende of the rope they make fast to one part of the house, and the other ende to the other part of the house: and in these they lye, which bee their beddes, and these kinde of beds bee used in 'all India, and there is not in any part of India any chambers that the people do use to lodge in aloft from the ground, nor they make any hie roomes, but only in this part of India: & in al other places they make their houses without any loftes or chambers, and they cover their houses with the leaves of datetrees, and of grasse. And from this fresh water sea unto Paria, the coast lyeth West Northwest, and is so ful of sholds that the ships cannot come neer to the land. There are from this river to Paria 250 leagues. In this fresh water sea, the tydes do ebbe & flow as much as they do in Britayne, and it standeth in 6 degrees and a halfe. Paria standeth on the other side of the Equinoctial toward the North, in seven degrees: In Paria the sea floweth but little, and from Paria towards the West, the sea doth not flow. From the entry of the gulfe of Paria unto the Cape that lyeth towards the West, are 35 leagues, and from thence the coast turneth towardes the Northeast other 35 leagues, & from thence the coast turneth toward the West. Before this gulfe standeth the Island of Trinidad, and towards the West doeth appeare the gulfe of Paria like to halfe a round circle, after the fashion of a Diameter, and at the end of this circle is the entery in of Paria, & at this entery there is betweene the land and the Island 8 leagues, and on the other side there is but litle space betweene the Hand and the land, but it is deepe, and hath a good entry: this Hand of Trinidad hath in length 25 leagues, and as many in bredth, and

standeth in eight degrees, and is inhabited of many people, and as yet not under subjection. Here the Indians do use to shoote with bowes and arrowes which are of a fathome in length, made of reeds, which grow in that Countrey, and at the ende of them is artificially joyned a piece of wood very strong, unto the which piece of wood at the end of it, they put a bone of a fish, in place of an arrow head: these kinde of bones bee harder then Diamonds, and every one of them be three or foure fingers long, & they are taken out of a fish that hath three of these bones, one upon the backe, another under every wing: but that which groweth upon the backe is the strongest and the greatest. In this Island the people saith that there groweth golde: and in this Island and in Paria growe reedes so great, that they make staves of them and cary of them into Spaine. Likewise there bee Popin-jayes very great and gentle, and some of them have their foreheads yellow, and this sort do quickly learne to speak, and speak much. There be likewise in the gulfe of Paria pearles, although not many, but very good and great.
