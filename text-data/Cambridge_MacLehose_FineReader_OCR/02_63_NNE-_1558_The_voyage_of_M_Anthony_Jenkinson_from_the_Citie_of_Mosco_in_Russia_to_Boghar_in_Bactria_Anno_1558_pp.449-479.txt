The fift meade is made of hony and water, with other mixtures.

There is also a delicate drinke drawn from the root of the birch tree, called in the Russe tongue Berozevites, which drinke the noble men and others use in Aprill, May, and June, which are the three moneths of the spring time : for after those moneths, the sappe of the tree dryeth, and then they cannot have it.

[I- 3^-1

He 23. day of April, in the yeere 1558. (having obtained the Emperor of Russia his letters, directed unto sundry kings and princes, by whose dominions I should passe) I departed from Mosco by water, having with mee two of your servants, namely, Richard Johnson, &

Robert Johnson, and a Tartar Tolmach, with divers

parcels of wares, as by the inventory appeareth : and the 28. day we came to a town called Collom, distant from the Mosco 20. leagues, & passing one league beyond the saide Collom, we came unto a river called Occa, into the which the river Mosco falleth, and looseth his name : and passing downe the said river Occa 8. leagues, we came unto a castle called Terrevettisko, which we left upon our right hand, and proceeding forward, the second day of May, we came unto another castle called Peroslave, distant 8. leagues, leaving it also on our right hand. The third day we came unto the place where olde Rezan was situate, beeing now most of it ruined and overgrowen, and distant from the said Peroslave, 6. leagues : the 4. day we passed by a castle called Terrecovia, from Rezan 12. leagues, & the 6.

day we came to another castle called Cassim, under the government of a Tartar prince named Utzar Zegoline, sometime Emperour of the worthy citie of Cazan, and now subject unto the Emperour of Russia. But leaving Cassim on our left hand, the 8. day we came unto a faire town called Morom, from Cassim 20. leagues, where we took the sonne, and found the latitude 56. degrees: and proceeding forward the 11. day, we came unto another faire town & castle called Nyse Novogrod, situated at the falling of the foresaid river Occa into the worthie river of Volga, distant from the saide Moron 25. leagues, in the latitude of 56. degrees 18. minutes. From Rezan to this Nyse Novogrod, on both sides the said river of Occa, is raised the greatest store of waxe and hony in all the land of Russia. We tarried at the foresaid Nyse Novogrod until the 19. day, for the comming of a captain which was sent by the Emperour to rule at Astracan, who beeing arrived, and having the number of 500. great boates under his conduct, some laden with victuals, souldiers, and munition : and other some with merchandise, departed altogether the said 19. day from the said Nyse Novogrod, and the 22. we came unto a castle called Vasiliagorod, distant 25. leagues, which we left upon our right hand. This towne or castle had his name of this Emperours father, who was called Vasilius, and gorod in the Russe tongue is as much to say as a castle, so that Vasiliagorod is to say, Vasilius castle : and it was the furthest place that the said Emperour conquered from the Tartars. But this present Emperour his sonne, called Ivan Vasiliwich, hath had great good successe in his warres, both against the Christians and also the Mahometists and Gentiles, but especially against the Tartars, inlarging his Empire even to the Caspian sea, having conquered the famous river of Volga, with all the countreis thereabout adjacent. Thus proceeding on our journey the 25. day of May aforesaide, wee came to another castle called Sabowshare, which wee

45°

left on our right hand, distant from Vasiliagorod 16. leagues. The countrey heereabout is called Mordovits, and the habitants did professe the law of the Gentiles : but nowe beeing conquered by this Emperour of Russia, most of them are christened, but lie in the woods and wildernesse, without towne or habitation.

The 27. day we passed by another castle called Swyasko, distant from Shabowshare aforesaid 25. leagues: we left it on our right hand, and the 29. came unto an Island one league from the citie of Cazan, from Cazan. which falleth downe a river called Cazanka reca, & entreth into the foresaide Volga. Cazan is a faire town after the Russe or Tartar fashion, with a strong castle, situated upon a high hill, and was walled round about with timber & earth, but now the Emperour of Russia hath given order to plucke downe the old walles, and to builde them againe of free stone. It hath bene a citie of great wealth and riches, and being in the hands of the Tartars it was a kingdome of it selfe, and did more vexe the Russes in their warres, then any other nation : but 9. yeres past, this Emperour of Russia conquered it, and tooke the king captive, who being but young is nowe baptised, and brought up in his court with two other princes, which were also kings of the said Cazan, and being ech of them in time of their raignes in danger of their subjects through civil discord, came and rendred themselves at several times unto the said Emperor, so that at this present there are three princes in the court of Russia, which had bene Emperours of the said Cazan, whom the Emperour useth with great honour.

We remained at Cazan till the 13. day of June, and then departed from thence : and the same day passed [I. 325.] by an Island called the Island of merchants, because it was The Island of woont to be a place where all merchants, as well Russes marchants. and Cazanites, as Nagayans and Crimmes, and divers other nations did resort to keepe mart for buying and selling, but nowe it is forsaken, and standeth without

451

Hords.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

any such resort thither, or at Cazan, or at any place about it, from Mosco unto Mare Caspium.

Thus proceeding forward the 14. day, we passed by a goodly river called Cama, which we left on our left hand. This river falleth out of the countrey of Permia into the river of Volga, and is from Cazan 15. leagues : and the countrey lying betwixt the said Cazan and the said river Cama on the left hand of Volga is called Vachen, and the inhabitants be Gentiles, and live in the wildernesse without house or habitation : and the countrey on the other side of Volga over against the said river Cama is called the land of Cheremizes, halfe Gentiles, halfe Tartars, and all the land on the left hand of the said Volga from the said river unto Astracan, and so following the North and Northeast side of the Caspian sea, to a land of the Tartars called Turkemen, is called the countrey of Mangat or Nagay, whose inhabitants are of the law of Mahomet, and were all destroyed in the yeere 1558, at my being at Astracan, through civill warres among them, accompanied with famine, pestilence, and such plagues, in such sort that in the said yeere there were consumed of the people, in one sort and another, above one hundred thousand : the like plague was never seen in those parts, so that the said countrey of Nagay being a countrey of great pasture, remaineth now unreplenished to the great contentation of the Russes, who have had cruel warres a long time together.

The Nagayans when they flourished, lived in this maner: they were divided into divers companies called Hords, and every Hord had a ruler, whom they obeyed as their king, and was called a Murse. Towne or house they had none, but lived in the open fields, every Murse or King having his Hords or people about him, with their wives, children and cattell, who having consumed the pasture in one place, remooved unto another : and when they remoove they have houses like tents set upon wagons or carts, which are drawen

45 2

from place to place with camels, & therin their wives, children, and all their riches, which is very litle, is caried about, and every man hath at the least foure or five wives besides concubines. Use of money they have none, but doe barter their cattell for apparell and other necessaries. They delight in no arte nor science, except the warres, wherein they are expert, but for the most part they be pasturing people, and have great store of cattel, which is all their riches. They eate much flesh, and especially the horse, and they drinke mares milke, wherewith they be oftentimes drunke : they are seditious & inclined to theft and murther. Corne they sowe not, neither doe eate any bread, mocking the Christians for the same, and disabling our strengths, saying we live by eating the top of a weede, and drinke a drinke made of the same, allowing their great devouring of flesh, and drinking of milke to be the increase of their strength. But now to proceed forward to my journey.

All the countrey upon our right hand the river Volga, from over against the river Cama unto the towne of Astracan, is the land of Crimme, whose inhabitants be The Crimme also of the lawe of Mahomet, and live for the most part Tartars. according to the fashions of the Nagayes, having continual wars with the Emperour of Russia, and are valiant in the fielde, having countenance, and support from the great Turke.

The 16. day of June we passed by certaine fishermens houses called Petowse twenty leagues from the river Cama, where is great fishing for sturgeon, so continuing our way untill the 22. day, and passing by another great river called Samar, which falleth out of the afore- The river of saide countrey, and runneth through Nagay, and entreth Samar-into the saide river of Volga. The 28. day wee came unto a great hill, where was in times past a castle made by the Crimmes, but now it is ruined, being the just midway betweene the said Cazan and Astrachan, which is 200. leagues or thereabout, in the latitude of 51.

Astracan.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

degrees 47. minutes. Upon all this shore groweth abundance of Licoris, whose root runneth within the ground like a vine.

Thus going forward the sixt day of July we came to a place called Perovolog, so named because in times past the Tartars caried their boates from Volga unto the river Tanais, otherwise called Don, by land, when they would robbe such as passed downe the said Volga to Astracan, and also such as passed downe by the river Tanais, to Asou, Caffa, or any other towne situated upon Mare Euxinum, into which sea Tanais falleth, who hath his springs in the countrey of Rezan, out of a plaine ground. It is at this streight of Perovolog from the one river to the other two leagues by land, and is a dangerous place for theeves and robbers, but now it is not so evil! as it hath bene, by reason of the Emperour of Russia his conquests.

Departing from Perovolog, having the wildernesse on both sides, wee sawe a great heard of Nagayans, pasturing, as is abovesaid, by estimation above a thousand Camels drawing of cartes with houses upon them like tents, of a strange fashion, seeming to bee a farre off a towne : that Hord was belonging to a great Murse called Smille, the greatest prince in all Nagay, who hath slaine and driven away all the rest, not sparing his owne brethren and children, and having peace with this Emperour of Russia he hath what he needeth, and ruleth alone : so that now the Russes live in peace with the Nagayans, who were wont to have mortali warres together.

The 14. day of July passing by an old castle, which was Old Astracan, and leaving it upon our right hand, we arrived at New Astracan, which this Emperour of Russia conquered sixe yeeres past, in the yeere 1552. It is from the Mosco unto Astracan sixe hundreth leagues, or thereabout. The towne of Astracan is situated in an Island upon a hill side, having a castle within the same, walled about with earth and timber,

454

neither faire nor strong: The towne is also walled about with earth : the buildings and houses (except it be the captaines lodging, and certaine other gentlemens) most base and simple. The Island is most destitute and barren of wood and pasture, and the 'ground will beare no corne : the aire is there most infected, by reason (as I suppose) of much fish, and specially Sturgion, by Store of Stur-which onely the inhabitants live, having great scarsitie &ms' of flesh and bread. They hang up their fish in their streets and houses to dry for their provision, which causeth such abundance of flies to increase there, as the like was never seene in any land, to their great plague.

And at my being at the sayd Astracan, there was a great famine and plague among the people, and specially among the Tartars called Nagayans, who the same time came thither in great numbers to render themselves to the Russes their enemies, & to seeke succour at their hands, their countrey being destroyed, as I said before : but they were but ill entertained or relieved, for there died a great number of them for hunger, which lay all the Island through in heapes dead, and like to beasts unburied, very pitifull to behold : many of them were also sold by the Russes, and the rest were banished from the Island. At that time it had bene an easie thing to have converted that wicked Nation to the Christian faith, if the Russes themselves had bene good Christians : but how should they shew compassion unto other Nations, when they are not merciful! unto their owne ? At my being there I could have bought many goodly Tartars children, if I would have had a thousand, of their owne fathers and mothers, to say, a boy or a wench for a loafe of bread woorth sixe pence in England, but we had more need of victuals at that time then of any such merchandise. This Astracan is the furthest hold that this Emperour of Russia hath conquered of the Tartars towards the Caspian sea, which he keepeth very strong, sending thither every yere provision of men, and victuals, and timber to build the castle.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

There is a certaine trade of merchandise there used, but as yet so small and beggerly, that it is not woorth the making mention, and yet there come merchants thither from divers places. The chiefest commodities that the Russes bring thither are redde hides, redde sheepes skinnes, woodden vessels, bridles, and saddles, knives, and other trifles, with corne, bacon, and other victuals. The Tartars bring thither divers kindes of wares made of cotten wooll, with divers kindes of wrought silkes: and they that come out of Persia, namely from Shamacki doe bring sowing silke, which is the coursest that they use in Russeland, Crasko, divers kinds of pide silkes for girdles, shirts of male, bowes, swords, and such like things: and some yeeres corne, and wallnuts, but all such things in such small quantitie, the merchants being so beggerly and poore that bring the same, that it is not worth the writing, neither is there any hope of trade in all those parts woorth the folowing.

This foresaid Island of Astracan is in length twelve leagues, and in bredth three, & lieth East and West in the latitude of fortie seven degrees, nine minutes: we taried there until the sixt day of August, and having bought and provided a boate in company with certaine Tartars and Persians, we laded our goods and imbarked our selves, and the same day departed I, with the said two Johnsons having the whole charge of the Navigation downe the sayd river Volga, being very crooked, and full of flats toward the mouth thereof. We entred into the Caspian sea the tenth day of August at the Easterly side of the sayd river, being twentie leagues from Astracan aforesayd, in the latitude of fortie six degrees, twentie seven minutes.

Volga hath seventie mouthes or fals into the sea: and we having a large wind, kept the Northeast shore, and the eleventh day we sailed seven leagues Eastnortheast, and came unto an Island having an high hill therein, called Accurgar, a good marke in the sea.

456

From thence East tenne leagues, we fell with another Island called Bawhiata, much higher then the other. Within these two Islands to the Northwards, is a great Baie called the Blew sea. From thence wee sailed East The blew sea. and by North ten leagues, and having a contrary wind, we came to an anker in a fadome water, and so rid untill the fifteenth day, having a great storme at Southeast, being a most contrary wind, which we rid out. Then the wind came to the North, and we weyed, and set our course Southeast, and that day sailed eight leagues.

Thus proceeding forwards, the 17. day wee lost sight [I. 327.] of land, and the same day sailed thirtie leagues, and the 18. day twentie leagues winding East, and fell with a land called Baughleata, being 74. leagues from the Taughkata mouth of the said Volga, in the latitude of 46. degrees 7+54. minutes, the coast lying neerest East and by South, J and West and by North. At the point of this land lieth buried a holy Prophet, as the Tartars call him, of their law, where great devotion is used of all such Maho-metists as doe passe that way.

The nineteenth day the winde being West, and we winding Eastsoutheast, we sailed tenne leagues, and passed by a great river called laic, which hath his spring laic river. in the lande of Siberia, nigh unto the foresaid river Cama, and runneth through the lande of Nagay, falling into this Mare Caspium. And up this river one dayes journey is a Towne called Serachick, subject to the Serachick. aforesaid Tartar prince called Murse Smille, which is nowe in friendship with the Emperour of Russia. Here is no trade of merchandize used, for that the people have no use of money, and are all men of warre, and pasturers of cattel, and given much to theft and murther. Thus being at an anker against this river laic, and all our men being on land, saving I, who lay sore sicke, and five Tartars, whereof one was reputed a holy man, because he came from Mecka, there came unto us a boate with thirtie men well armed and appointed, who boorded us, and began to enter into our barke, and our holy

457

Tartar called Azy, perceiving that, asked them what they would have, and withall made a prayer : with that these rovers staied, declaring that they were Gentlemen, banished from their countrey, and out of living, & came to see if there were any Russes or other Christians (which they call Caphars) in our barke ? To whom this Azi most stoutly answered, that there were none, avowing the same by great othes of their lawe, (which lightly they will not breake) whom the rovers beleeved, and upon his words departed. And so through the fidelitie of that Tartar, I with all my company and goods were saved, and our men being come on boord, and the wind faire, we departed from that place, and winding East and Southeast, that day being the 20. of August sailed 16. leagues.

The 21. day we passed over a Bay of 6. leagues broad, and fell with a Cape of land, having two Islands at the Southeast part thereof, being a good marke in the sea : & doubling that Cape the land trended Northeast, and maketh another Bay, into which falleth the great river The Countrie Yem, springing out of the land of Colmack. of Colmack. The 22. 23. and 24. dayes, we were at an anker.

The 25. the winde came faire, and wee sailed that day 20. leagues, and passed by an Island of lowe land, and there about are many flats and sands : and to the Northward of this Island there goeth in a great Bay, but we set off from this Island, and winded South to come into deepe water, being much troubled with shoalds & flats, and ran that course 10. leagues, then East Southeast 20. leagues, and fel with the maine land, being full of copped hils, and passing along the coast 20. leagues, the further we sailed, the higher was the land.

The 27. day we crossed over a Bay, the South shore being the higher land, and fel with a high point of land : & being overthwart the Cape, there rose such a storme at the East, that we thought verily we should have perished : this storme continued 3. dayes. From 458

1558. this Cape we passed to a port called Manguslave. The The port of place where we should have arrived at the Southermost Manguslave. part of the Caspian sea, is 12. leagues within a Bay: but we being sore tormented and tossed with this foresaid storme, were driven unto another land on ye other side the Bay, overthwart the sayd Manguslave being very lowe land, and a place as well for the ill commoditie of the haven, as of those brute field people, where never barke nor boate had before arrived, not liked of us.

But yet here we sent certaine of our men to land to talke with the governour and people, as well for our good usage at their handes, as also for provision of camels to carry our goods from the sayd sea side to a place called Sellyzure, being from the place of our landing five and twentie dayes journey. Our messengers returned with comfortable wordes and faire promises of all things.

Wherefore the 3. day of September 1558. we dis- They goe on charged our barke, and I with my companie were gently entertained of the Prince & of his people. But before our departure from thence, we found them to be very bad and brutish people, for they ceased not daily to molest us, either by fighting, stealing or begging, raising the prise of horse and camels, & victuals, double that it was woont there to be, and forced us to buy the water that we did drinke : which caused us to hasten away, and to conclude with them as well for the hire of camels, as for the prise of such as wee bought, with other provision, according to their owne demaund : So that for every camels lading, being but 400. waight of ours, we agreed to give three hides of Russia, and foure woodden dishes, and to the Prince or governour of the sayd people, one ninth, and two sevenths : Namely, nine several! things, and twise seven severall things : for money they use none.

And thus being ready, the foureteenth of September [I. 328.] we departed from that place, being a Caravan of a

459

thousand camels. And having travailed five dayes journey, we came to another Princes Dominion, and upon the way there came unto us certaine Tartars on horseback, being well armed, and servants unto the saide Prince called Timor Soltan, governour of the said countrey of Manguslave, where wee meant to have arrived and discharged our barke, if the great storm aforesayd had not disappointed. These aforesaid Tartars stayd our Caravan in the name of their Prince, and opened our wares, and tooke such things as they thought best for their saide prince without money, but for such things as they tooke from me, which was a ninth (after much dissension) I ridde unto the same Prince, and presented my selfe before him, requesting his favour, and pasport to travaile through his countrey, and not to be robbed nor spoiled of his people : which request he graunted me, and intertained me very gently, com-maunding me to be well feasted with flesh and mares milke : for bread they use none, nor other drinke except water : but money he had none to give mee for such things as he tooke of mee, which might be of value in Russe money, fifteene rubbles, but he gave me his letter, and a horse woorth seven rubbles. And so I departed from him being glad that I was gone : for he was reported to be a very tyrant, and if I had not gone unto him, I understoode his commaundement was, that I should have beene robbed and destroyed.

This Soltan lived in the fieldes without Castle or towne, and sate, at my being with him, in a litle rounde house made of reedes covered without with felt, and within with Carpets. There was with him the great Metropolitan of that wilde Country, esteemed of the people, as the Bishop of Rome is in most parts of Europe, with divers other of his chiefe men. The Soltan with this Metropolitan demanded of me many questions, as wel touching our kingdoms, lawes, and Religion, as also the cause of my comming into those parts, with my further pretence. To whom I answered 460

concerning all things, as unto me seemed best, which they tooke in good part. So having leave I departed and overtooke our Caravan, and proceeded on our journey, and travailed 20. dayes in the wildernes from the sea side without seeing towne or habitation, carying provision of victuals with us for the same time, and were driven by necessity to eate one of my camels and a horse for our part, as othei* did the like : and during the said 20. daies we found no water, but such as we drew out of old deepe welles, being very brackish and salt, and yet sometimes passed two or three dayes without the same. And the 5. day of October ensuing, we came unto a gulfe of the Caspian sea againe, where we found the water very fresh and sweete: at this gulfe the customers of the king of Turkeman met us, who took custome of every 25. one, and 7. ninthes for the saide king and his brethren, which being received they departed, and we remained there a day after to refresh our selves.

20 dayes tra-vaile in the wildernesse, with scarcitie of water.

Another gulfe of the Caspian sea.

Note that in times past there did fal into this gulf the great river Oxus, which hath his springs in the mountains of Paraponisus in India, & now commeth not so far, but falleth into another river called Ardock, ^ill-de which runneth toward the North, & consumeth himself ,cribeththis in the ground passing under ground above 500. miles, river of and then issueth out againe and falleth into the lake Ardok, cap. 4. of Kithay.

We having refreshed our selves at the foresaide gulfe, departed thence the 4. day of October, and the seventh day arrived at a castle called Sellizure, where ye king SelRzure, or called Azim Can, remained with 3. other of his brethren, ^ha^ure-and the 9. day I was commaunded to come before his presence, to whom I delivered the Emperors letters of Russia: and I also gave him a present of a ninth, who entertained me very well, and caused me to eate in his presence as his brethren did, feasting me with flesh of a wilde horse, and mares milk without bread. And the next day he sent for me again, and asked of me divers

461

Urgence.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

questions, as wel touching the affaires of the Emperour of Russia, as of our countrey and lawes, to which I answered as I thought good: so that at my departure he gave me his letters of safe conduct.

This Castle of Sellizure is situated upon an high hill, where the King called the Can lyeth, whose palace is built of earth very basely, and not strong : the people are but poore, and have litle trade of marchandise among them. The South part of this Castle is lowe lande, but very fruitfull, where grow many good fruites, among which there is one called a Dynie, of a great bignesse and full of moysture, which the people doe eate after meate in steade of drinke. Also there growes another fruite called a Carbuse of the bignesse of a great cucumber, yellow and sweete as sugar: also a certaine corne called legur, whose stalke is much like a sugar cane, and as high, and the graine like rice, which groweth at the toppe of the cane like a cluster of grapes; the water that serveth all that countrey is drawen by ditches out of the river Oxus, unto the great destruction of the said river, for which cause it falleth not into the Caspian sea as it hath done in times past, and in short time all that land is like to be destroied, and to become a wildernes for want of water, when the river of Oxus shal faile.

The 14. day of the moneth we departed from this Castle of Sellizure, and the 16. of the same we arrived at a citie called Urgence, where we paid custome as wel for our own heads, as for our camels and horses. And having there sojourned one moneth, attending the time of our further travaile, the king of that countrey called Aly Soltan, brother to the forenamed Azym Can, returned from a towne called Corasan, within the borders of Persia, which he lately had conquered from the Persians, with whom he and the rest of the kings of Tartaria have continuall warres. Before this king also I was commanded to come, to whom I likewise presented the Emperors letters of Russia, and he intertained

462

me wel, and demanded of me divers questions, and at my departure gave me his letters of safeconduct.

This city or towne of Urgence standeth in a plaine ground, with walles of the earth, by estimation 4. miles about it. The buildings within it are also of earth, but ruined and out of good order: it hath one long street that is covered above, which is the place of their market. It hath bene wonne and lost 4. times within 7. yeeres by civill warres, by meanes whereof there are but few merchants in it, and they very poore, and in all that towne I could not sell above 4. kerseis. The chiefest commodities there sold are such wares as come from Boghar, and out of Persia, but in most smal quantity not worth the writing. All the land from the Caspian sea to this Citie of Urgence is called the land of Turke-man, & is subject to the said Azim Can, and his brethren which be five in number, and one of them hath the name of the chiefe king called Can, but he is little obeyed saving in his owne Dominion, and where he dwelleth : for every one will be King of his owne portion, and one brother seeketh alwayes to destroy another, having no natural love among them, by reason that they are begotten of divers women, and commonly they are the children of slaves, either Christians or Gentiles, which the father doeth keepe as concubines, and every Can or Sultan hath at the least 4. or 5. wives, besides yong maidens and boyes, living most viciously: and when there are warres betwixt these brethren, (as they are seidome without) he that is overcome if he be not slaine, flieth to the field with such companie of men as will followe him, and there liveth in the wildernesse resorting to watering places, and so robbeth and spoileth as many Caravans of Marchants and others as they be able to overcome, continuing in this sort his wicked life, until such time as he may get power and aide to invade some of his brethren againe. From the Caspian sea unto the Castle of Sellizure aforesaid, and all the Countreis about the said Sea, the people live without

463

The countrey of Turkoman.

towne or habitation in the wilde fields, removing from one place to another in great companies with their cattel, whereof they have great store, as camels, horses, and sheepe both tame and wilde. Their sheepe are of great stature with great buttocks, weighing 60. or 80. pound in weight. There are many wild horses which the Tartars doe many times kil with their hawkes, and that in this order.

The hawkes are lured to sease upon the beasts neckes or heads, which with chafing of themselves and sore beating of the hawkes are tired: then the hunter following his game doeth slay the horse with his arrow or sword. In all this lande there groweth no grasse, but a certaine brush or heath, whereon the cattell feeding become very fat.

The Tartars never ride without their bow, arrowes, and sword, although it be on hawking, or at any other pleasure, and they are good archers both on horse-backe, and on foote also. These people have not the use of golde, silver, or any other coyne, but when they lacke apparell or other necessaries, they barter their cattell for the same. Bread they have none, for they neither till nor sow : they be great devourers of flesh, which they cut in smal pieces, & eat it by handfuls most greedily, & especially the horseflesh. Their chiefest drink is mares milke sowred, as I have said before of the Nagayans, & they wilbe drunk with the same. They have no rivers nor places of water in this countrey, until you come to the foresaid gulf, distant from the place of our landing 20. dayes journey, except it be in wels, the water wherof is saltish, & yet distant the one from the other two daies journey and more. They eate their meate upon the ground, sitting with their legs double under them, and so also when they pray. Art or science they have none, but live most idlely, sitting round in great companies in the fields, devising, and talking most vainely.

The 26. day of November, we departed from the 464

towne of Urgence, and having travailed by the river Oxus, too. mile, we passed over another great river called Ardock, where we paid a certaine pety custome.

This river Ardock is great, and very swift, falling out of nw of the foresaid Oxus, and passing about 1000. mile to the ^rtirjCkfalleth Northward, it then consumeth it selfe in the ground, a ‘ and passing under the same about 500. mile, issueth out againe, and falleth into the lake of Kitay, as I have before declared.

The 7. of December following, we arrived at a Castle The castle of called Kait, subject to a Soltan called Saramet Soltan, Ka,tl who meant to have robbed all the Christians in the Caravan, had it not bene for feare of his brother the king of Urgence, as we were informed by one of his chiefest counsellors, who willed us to make him a present, [I. 330.] which he tooke, and delivered: besides, we paid at the said castle for custome, of every camel one red hide of Russia, besides pety gifts to his officers.

Thus proceeding in our journey, the tenth day at night being at rest, and our watch set, there came unto us foure horsemen, which we tooke as spies, from whom wee tooke their weapons and bound them, and having well examined them, they confessed that they had seene the tract of many horsemen, and no footing of camels, & gave us to understand, that there were rovers and theeves abroade : for there travaile few people that are true and peaceable in that Countrey, but in companie of Caravan, where there be many camels : and horse-feeting new without camels were to be doubted. Whereupon we consulted & determined amongst our selves, and sent a poste to the said Soltan of Kayte, who immediatly came himselfe with 300. men, and mette these foure suspected men which we sent unto him, and examined them so streightly, and threatned them in such sort, that they confessed, there was a banished Prince with 40. men 3. daies journey forward, who lay in wait to destroy us, if he could, and that they themselves were of his companie.

n	465	2 G

The Soltan therefore understanding, that the theeves were not many, appointed us 80. men well armed with a Captaine to goe with us, and conduct us in our way. And the Soltan himselfe returned backe againe, taking the foure theeves with him. These souldiers travailed with us two dayes, consuming much of our victuals. And the 3. day in the morning very earely they set out before our Caravan, and having ranged the wildernes for the space of foure houres, they mette us, comming towards us as fast as their horse could runne, and declared that they had founde the tract of horses not farre from us, perceiving well that we should meete with enemies, and therefore willed us to appoint our selves for them, and asked us what wee would give them to conduct us further, or els they would returne. To whom we offered as we thought good, but they refused our offer, and would have more, and so we not agreeing they departed from us, and went back to their Soltan, who (as wee conjectured) was privie to the conspiracie. Divination by But they being gone, certaine Tartars of our companie sorcene. called holy men, (because they had bene at Mecha) caused the whole Caravan to stay, and would make their prayers, and devine howe wee should prosper in our journey and whether we should meet with any ill company or no ? To which, our whole Caravan did agree. And they tooke certaine sheepe and killed them, and tooke the blade bones of the same, and first sodde them, and then burnt them, and tooke of the blood of the said sheepe, and mingled it with the powder of the saide bones, and wrote certaine Characters with the saide blood, using many other ceremonies and wordes, and by the same devined and found, that wee shoulde meete with enemies and theeves (to our great trouble) but should overcome them, to which sorcerie, I and my companie gave no credit, but we found it true : for within 3. houres after that the souldiers departed from us, which was the 15. day of December, in the morning, we escried farre off divers horsemen which made towards us, and we (per-466

ceiving them to be rovers) gathered our selves together, being 40. of us wel appointed, and able to fight, and we made our prayers together every one after his lawe, professing to live and die one with another, and so prepared our selves. When the theeves were nigh unto us, we perceived them to be in number 37. men well armed, and appointed with bowes, arrowes and swords, and the captaine a prince banished from his Countrey. They willed us to yeelde our selves, or els to be slaine, but wee defied them, wherewith they shotte at us all at once, and wee at them very hotly, and so continued our fight from morning until two houres within night, divers men, horses and camels being wounded and slaine on both partes : and had it not bene for 4. handgunnes which I and my companie had and used, we had bene overcome and destroyed : for the theeves were better armed, and were also better archers then we ; But after wee had slaine divers of their men and horses with our gunnes, they durst not approch so nigh, which caused them to come to a truce with us untill the next morning, which we accepted, and encamped our selves upon a hill, and made the fashion of a Castle, walling it about with packes of wares, and laide our horses and camels within the same to save them from the shotte of arrowes : and the theeves also incamped within an arrowe shotte of us, but they were betwixt us and the water, which was to our great discomfort, because neither we nor our camels had drunke in 2. dayes before.

Thus keeping good watch, when halfe the night was spent, the Prince of the theeves sent a messenger halfe way unto us, requiring to talke with our Captaine, in their tongue, the Caravan Basha, who answered the messenger, I will not depart from my companie to goe into the halfe way to talke with thee : but if that thy Prince with all his companie will sweare by our Lawe to keepe the truce, then will I send a man to talke with thee, or els not. Which the Prince understanding as well himselfe as his company, swore so loude that 467

Handguns very profitable.

we might all heare. And then we sent one of our company (reputed a holy man) to talke with the same messenger. The message was pronounced aloude in this order, Our Prince demaundeth of the Caravan Basha, Bussarmans. and of all you that be Bussarmans, (that is to say cir-[I- 331.] cumcised) not desiring your bloods, that you deliver Caphar. into his hands as many Caphars, that is, unbeleevers

(meaning us the Christians) as are among you with their goods, and in so doing, hee will suffer you to depart with your goods in quietnesse, and on the contrary, you shall be handled with no lesse cruelty then the Caphars, if hee overcome you, as he doubteth not. To the which our Caravan Basha answered, that he had no Christians in his company, nor other strangers, but two Turkes which were of their Law, and although hee had, hee would rather die then deliver them, and that we were not afraide of his threatnings, and that should he know when day appeared. And so passing in talke, the theeves (contrary to their othe) caried our holy man away to their Prince, crying with a lowde voyce in token of victory, Olio, olio. Wherewith we were much discomforted, fearing that that holy man would betray us : but he being cruelly handled and much examined, would not to death confesse any thing which was to us prejudicial!, neither touching us, nor yet what men they had slaine and wounded of ours the day before. When the night was spent, in the morning we prepared our selves to battel againe : which the theeves perceiving, required to fall to agreement 8c asked much of us : And to be briefe, the most part of our companie being loth to go to battel againe, and having litle to loose, 8c safeconduct to passe, we were compelled to agree, and to give the theeves 20 ninths (that is to say) 20 times 9 severall things, and a camell to cary away the same, which being received, the theeves departed into the wildernes to their old habitation, and we went on our way forward. And The river of that night came to the river Oxus, where we refreshed Qxus.	our seiveSj having bene 3. dayes without water and

468

drinke, and tarried there all the next day, making mery with our slaine horses and camels, and then departed from that place, & for feare of meeting with the said theeves againe or such like, we left the high way which went along the said river, and passed through a wildernes wildernes of sand, and travelled 4 dayes in the same before we °fsande-came to water : and then came to a wel, the water being very brackish, and we then as before were in neede of water, and of other victuals, being forced to kill our horses and camels to eate.

In this wildernes also we had almost fallen into the hands of theeves : for one night being at rest, there came certaine scoutes, and caried away certaine of our men which lay a litle separated from the Caravan, wherewith there was a great shoute and crie, and we immediatly laded our camels, and departed being about midnight and very darke, and drove sore till we came to the river Oxus againe, and then we feared nothing being walled with the said river : & whether it was for that we had gotten the water, or for that the same theeves were far from us when the scouts discovered us, we knowe not, but we escaped that danger.

So upon the 23 day of December wee arrived at Bokhara Me the citie of Boghar in the lande of Bactria. This Boghar is situated in the lowest part of all the land, walled about with a high wall of earth, with divers gates into the same : it is divided into 3 partitions, whereof two parts are the kings, and the 3 part is for Marchants and markets, and every science hath their dwelling and market by themselves. The Citie is very great, and the houses for the most part of earth, but there are also many houses, temples and monuments of stone sumptuously builded, and gilt, and specially bathstoves so artificially built, that the like thereof is not in the world : the maner whereof is too long to rehearse. There is a little river running through the middest of the said Citie, but the water there of is most unholsome, for it breedeth sometimes in men that drinke thereof, and

469

A strange especially in them that be not there borne, a worme of an wormemmens ep long5 which lyeth commonly in the legge betwixt the S' flesh and the skinne, and is pluckt out about the ancle with great art and cunning, the Surgeons being much practised therein, and if shee breake in plucking out, the partie dieth, and every day she commeth out about an inch, which is rolled up, and so worketh till she be all out. And yet it is there forbidden to drinke any other thing then water, & mares milke, and whosoever is found to breake that law is whipped and beaten most cruelly through the open markets, and there are officers appointed for the same, who have authoritie to goe into any mans house, to search if he have either Aquavitae, wine, or brage, and finding the same, doe breake the vessels, spoile the drinke, and punish the masters of the house most cruelly, yea, and many times if they perceive but by the breath of a man that he hath drunke, without further examination he shall not escape their hands.

There is a Metropolitane in this Boghar, who causeth this law to bee so streightly kept: and he is more obeyed then the king, and will depose the king, and place another at his will and pleasure, as he did by this king that raigned at our being there, and his predecessour, by the meanes of the sayd Metropolitan : for he betrayed him, and in the night slewe him in his chamber, who was a Prince that loved all Christians well.

This Countrey of Boghar was sometime subject to the Persians, & do now speake the Persian tongue, but yet now it is a kingdome of it selfe, and hath most cruel warres continually with the sayd Persians about their [I* 332-] religion, although they be all Mahometists. One occasion of their wars is, for that the Persians will not cut the haire of their upper lips, as the Bogharians and all other Tartars doe, which they accompt great sinne, and cal them Caphars, that is, unbeleevers, as they doe the Christians.

The king of Boghar hath no great power or riches, his revenues are but small, and he is most mainteined 47°

by the Citie : for he taketh the tenth penie of all things that are there solde, as well by the craftsmen as by the marchants, to the great impoverishment of the people, whom he keepeth in great subjection, and when he lacketh money, he sendeth his officers to the shoppes of the sayd Marchants to take their wares to pay his debts, and will have credite of force, as the like he did to pay me certaine money that he owed me for 19 pieces of Kersey. Their T& °f money is silver and copper, for gold there is none BoSl,ar-currant: they have but one piece of silver, & that is worth 12 pence English, and the copper money are called Pooles, and 120 of them goeth the value of the said 12. pence, and is more common paiment then the silver, which the king causeth to rise and fall to his most advantage every other moneth, and sometimes twise a moneth, not caring to oppresse his people, for that he loketh not to reigne above 2 or 3 yeres before he be either slaine or driven away, to the great destruction of the countrey and merchants.

The 26 day of the moneth I was commanded to come before the said king, to whom I presented the Emperour of Russia his letters, who interteined us most gently, and caused us to eate in his presence, and divers times he sent for me, and devised with me familiarly in his secret chamber, as well of the power of the Emperour, and the great Turke, as also of our countries, lawes, and religion, and caused us to shoote in handguns before him, and did himselfe practise the use thereof. But after all this great intertainement before my departure he shewed himselfe a very Tartar : for he went to the wars owing me money, and saw me not payd before his departure. And although indeede he gave order for the same, yet was I verie ill satisfied, and forced to rebate part, and to take wares as payment for the rest contrary to my expectation : but of a begger better paiment I could not have, and glad I was so to be paid and dispatched.

But yet I must needs praise & commend this barbarous king, who immediately after my arrivall at Boghar,

471

having understoode our trouble with the theeves, sent 100 men well armed, and gave them great charge not to returne before they had either slaine or taken the sayd theeves. Who according to their commission ranged the wildernes in such sort, that they met with the said company of theeves, and slew part, and part fledde, and foure they tooke and brought unto the king, and two of them were sore wounded in our skirmish with our gunnes : And after the king had sent for me to come to see them, he caused them all 4 to be hanged at his palace gate, because they were Gentlemen, to the example of others. And of such goods as were gotten againe, I had part restored me, and this good justice I found at his hands.

There is yerely great resort of Marchants to this Citie of Boghar, which travaile in great Caravans from the countries thereabout adjoining, as India, Persia, Balgh, Russia, with divers others, and in times past from Cathay, when there was passage : but these Marchants are so beggerly and poore, and bring so little quantitie of wares, lying two or 3 yeeres to sell the same, that there is no hope of any good trade there to be had worthy the following.

The chiefe commodities that are brought thither out of these foresayd Countreys, are these following.

The Indians doe bring fine whites, which the Tartars do all roll about their heads, & al other kinds of whites, which serve for apparell made of coton wooll and crasko, but golde, silver, precious stones, and spices they bring none. I enquired and perceived that all such trade passeth to the Ocean sea, and the vaines where all such things are gotten are in the subjection of the Portingals. The Indians carie from Boghar againe wrought silkes, red hides, slaves, and horses, with such like, but of Kerseis and other cloth, they make little accompt. I offered to barter with Marchants of those Countreis, which came from the furthest parts of India, even from the countrey of Bengala, & the river Ganges, to give

472

1558. them Kersies for their commodities, but they would not barter for such commoditie as cloth.

The Persians do bring thither Craska, wollen cloth, Merchandise linnen cloth, divers kindes of wrought pide silkes, Argo-macks, with such like, and doe carie from thence redde hides with other Russe wares, and slaves, which are of divers countreies, but cloth they will by none, for that they bring thither themselves, and is brought unto them as I have inquired from Aleppo in Syria, and the parts of Turkie. The Russes doe carie unto Boghar, redde Marchaudiu hides, sheepeskinnes, wollen cloth of divers sorts, °fRussia' woodden vessels, bridles, saddles, with such like, and doe carie away from thence divers kindes of wares made of cotton wooll, divers kinds of silkes, Crasca, with other things, but there is but smal utterance. [I. 333.] From the Countreis of Cathay are brought thither in Marchandise time of peace, and when the way is open, musk, rubarbe, of Cathay. satten, damaske, with divers other things. At my being at Boghar, there came Caravans out of all these foresaid Countries, except from Cathay: and the cause why there came none from thence was the great warres that had dured 3 yeres before my comming thither, and yet dured betwixt 2 great Countries & cities of Tartars, that are directly in the way betwixt the said Boghar and the said Cathay, and certaine barbarous fielde people, as well Gentiles as Mahometists bordering to the said Cities. The cities are called Taskent and Caskar, and the people that warre against Taskent & Taskent are called Cassaks of the law of Mahomet: Cascar-and they which warre with the sayd countrey of Caskar are called Kings, Gentiles & idolaters. These 2 barbarous nations are of great force living in the fields without house or towne, & have almost subdued the foresaid cities, & so stopped up the way, that it is impossible for any Caravan to passe unspoiled : so that 3 yeres before our being there, no Caravan had gone, or used trade betwixt the countries of Cathay and Boghar, and when the way is cleare, it is 9 moneths journey.

He returneth the eight of March 1559.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES

To speake of the said countrey of Cathay, and of such newes as I have heard thereof, I have thought it best to reserve it to our meeting. I having made my solace at Boghar in the Winter time, and having learned by much inquisition, the trade thereof, as also of all the other countries thereto adjoyning, and the time of the yeere being come, for all Caravans to depart, and also the king being gone to the warres, and newes come that he was fled, and I advertised by the Metropolitan himselfe, that I should depart, because the towne was like to bee besieged : I thought it good and meete, to take my journey some way, and determined to have gone from thence into Persia, and to have seene the trade of that countrey, although I had enformed my selfe sufficiently thereof, as well at Astracan, as at Boghar: and perceived well the trades not to be much unlike the trades of Tartaria : but when I should have taken my journey that way, it was let by divers occasions : the one was, the great wars that did newly begin betwixt the Sophie, and the kings of Tartaria, whereby the waies were destroyed : and there was a Caravan destroied with rovers & theeves, which came out of India and Persia, by safe conduct : and about ten daies journey from Boghar, they were robbed, and a great part slaine. Also the Metropolitan of Boghar, who is greater then the king, tooke the Emperors letters of Russia from me, without which I should have bene taken slave in every place : also all such wares as I had received in barter for cloth, and as I tooke perforce of the king, & other his Nobles, in paiment of money due unto me, were not vendible in Persia: for which causes, and divers others, I was constrained to come backe againe to Mare Caspium, the same way I went : so that the eight of March 1559, we departed out of the said Citie of Boghar, being a Caravan of 600 Camels : and if we had not departed when we did, I and my company had bene in danger to have lost life and goods. For ten daies after our departure, the king of Samarcand came

474

with an armie, & besieged the said Citie of Boghar, the king being absent, and gone to the wars against another prince, his kinsman, as the like chanceth in those Countries once in two or three yeres. For it is mar-veil, if a King reigne there above three or foure yeres, to the great destruction of the Countrey, and marchants.

The 25 of March, we came to the foresayd towne of Urgence, and escaped the danger of 400 rovers, which Urgence. lay in waite for us backe againe, being the most of them of kindred to that company of theeves, which we met with going foorth, as we perceived by foure spies, which were taken. There were in my company, and committed to my charge, two ambassadors, the one from the king of Boghar, the other from the king of Balke,	king of

and were sent unto the Emperor of Russia. And after °r having taried at Urgence, and the Castle of Sellysure, ag ' eight daies for the assembling, and making ready of our Caravan, the second of Aprill we departed from thence, having foure moe Ambassadors in our companie, sent from the king of Urgence, and other Sol tans, his brethren, unto the Emperor of Russia, with answere of such letters as I brought them : and the same Ambassadors were also committed unto my charge by the sayde Kings and princes : to whome I promised most faithfully, and swore by our law, that they should be well used in Rusland, and suffered to depart from thence againe in safetie, according as the Emperor had written also in his letters : for they somewhat doubted, because there had none gone out of Tartaria into Russia, of long time before.

The 23 of Aprill, we arrived at the Mare Caspium againe, where we found our barke which we came in, but neither anker, cable, cocke, nor saile : neverthelesse wee brought hempe with us, and spunne a cable our selves, with the rest of our tackling, and made us a saile of cloth of cotton wooll, and rigged our barke as well as we could, but boate or anker we had none. In the meane time being devising to make an anker of wood 475

of a cart wheele, there arrived a barke, which came from Astracan, with Tartars and Russes, which had 2 ankers, with whom I agreed for the one : and thus being in a readines, we set saile and departed, I, and the two Johnsons being Master and Mariners our selves, having in our barke the said sixe ambassadors, and 25 Russes, [I. 334.J which had bene slaves a long time in Tartaria, nor ever had before my comming, libertie, or meanes to get home, and these slaves served to rowe when neede was. Thus sailing sometimes along the coast, and sometimes out of sight of lande, the 13. day of May, having a contrary winde, wee came to an anker, being three leagues from the shoare, & there rose a sore storme, which continued 44. houres, and our cable being of our owne spinning, brake, and lost our anker, and being off a lee shoare, and having no boate to helpe us, we hoysed our saile, and bare roomer with the said shoare, looking for present death : but as God provided for us, we ranne into a creeke ful of oze, and so saved our selves with our barke, & lived in great discomfort for a time. For although we should have escaped with our lives the danger of the sea, yet if our barke had perished, we knew we should have bene, either destroyed, or taken slaves by the people of that Countrey, who live wildly in the field, like beasts, without house or habitation. Thus when the storme was seased, we went out of the creeke againe : and having set the land with our Compasse, and taken certaine markes of the same, during the time of the tempest, whilest we ridde at our anker, we went directly to the place where we ridde, with our barke againe, and found our anker which wee lost: whereat the Tartars much marveiled, how we did it. While we were in the creeke, we made an anker of wood of cart wheeles, which we had in our barke, which we threw away, when wee had found our yron anker againe. Within two dayes after, there arose another great storme, at the Northeast, and we lay a trie, being driven far into the sea, and had much ado to keepe

476

1559-our barke from sinking, the billowe was so great: but at the last, having faire weather, we tooke the Sunne, and knowing howe the land lay from us, we fel with the River Yaik, according to our desire, wherof the Tartars were very glad, fearing that wee should have bene driven to the coast of Persia, whose people were unto them great enemies.

Note, that during the time of our Navigation, wee The English set up the redde crosse of S. George in our flagges, for '5 honour of the Christians, which I suppose was never p ' seene in the Caspian sea before. We passed in this voyage divers fortunes : notwithstanding the 28. of May we arrived in safetie at Astracan, and there remained till the tenth of June following, as well to prepare us small boates, to goe up against the streame of Volga, with our goods, as also for the companie of the Ambassadours of Tartarie, committed unto me, to bee brought to the presence of the Emperour of Russia.

This Caspian sea (to say some thing of it) is in length about two hundred leagues, and in breadth 150. without any issue to other seas : to the East part whereof, joyneth the great desert countrey of the Tartars, called Turkemen : to the West, the countreyes of the Chyr-casses, the mountaines of Caucasus, and the Mare Euxinum, which is from the said Caspian Sea a hundred leagues. To the North is the river Volga, and the land of Nagay, and to the South part joyne the countreys of Media and Persia. This sea is fresh water in many notable deplaces, and in other places as salt as our great Ocean, tcription of the It hath many goodly Rivers falling into it, and it avoideth Casfian sea-not it selfe except it be under ground. The notable Rivers that fall into it, are first the great River of Volga, called in the Tartar tongue Edell, which springeth out of a lake in a marrish or plaine ground, not farre from the Citie of Novogrode in Russia, and it is from the spring to the Sea, above two thousande English miles.

It hath divers other goodly Rivers falling into it, as out of Siberia, Yaic, and Yem : Also out of the moun-477

taines of Caucasus, the Rivers of Cyrus and Arash, and divers others.

As touching the trade of Shamaky in Media and Tebris, with other townes in Persia, I have enquired, and do well understand, that it is even like to the trades of Tartaria, that is little utterance, and small profite : and I have bene advertised that the chiefe trade of Persia is into Syria, and so transported into the Levant sea. The fewe shippes upon the Caspian Seas, the want of Mart and port Townes, the povertie of the people, and the ice, maketh that trade naught.

At Astracan there were merchants of Shamaky, with whom I offered to barter, and to give them kersies for their wares, but they would not, saying, they had them as good cheape in their countrey, as I offred them, which was sixe rubbles for a kersie, that I asked : and while I was at Boghar, there were brought thither out of Persia, Cloth, and divers commodities of our countries, which were sold as good cheape, as I might sell ours.

The tenth day of June, we departed from Astracan towards the Mosco, having an hundred gunners in our company at the Emperors charges, for the safe conduct of the Tartar Ambassadors and me. And the eight and twentieth day of July folowing, wee arrived at the citie of Cazan, having bene upon the way from Astracan thither, sixe weekes and more, without any refreshing of victuals : for in all that way there is no habitation.

The seventh of August folowing, wee departed from Cazan, and transported our goods by water, as farre as the citie of Morum, and then by land : so that the [I. 335.] second of September, we arrived at the ci tie of Mosco, His arrival at and the fourth day I came before the Emperours September Majestie, kissed his hand, and presented him a white Cowes taile of Cathay, and a drumme of Tartaria, which he well accepted. Also I brought before him all the Ambassadors that were committed to my charge, with all the Russe slaves: and that day I dined in his 478

Majesties presence, and at dinner, his Grace sent me meate by a Duke, & asked me divers questions touching the lands and countreis where I had bene. And thus I remained at the Mosco about your affaires, until the 17. day of February that your wares were sent downe : and then having licence of the Emperors Majestie to depart, the 21. day I came to your house at Vologhda, and there remained until the breaking up of the yere : and then having seene all your goods laden into your boates, I departed with the same, and arrived withall in safetie at Colmogro the 9. of May 1560. And here I cease for this time, intreating you to beare with this my large discourse, which by reason of the varietie of matter, I could make no shorter, and I beseech God to prosper all your attempts.
