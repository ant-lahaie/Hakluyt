[III. 194.] The voyage of the Grace of Bristol of M. Rice Jones, a Barke of thirty five Tunnes, up into the Bay of Saint Laurence to the Northwest of Newefoundland, as farre as the Isle of Assumption or Natiscotec, for the barbes or fynnes of Whales and traine Oyle, made by Silvester Wyet, Shipmaster of Bristoll.



Ee departed with the aforesaid Barke manned with twelve men for the place aforesaid from ----- Bristoll the 4 of Aprill 1594. and fell with Cape dâ€™Espere on the coast of Newefoundland the nineteneth of May in the height of 47. We went thence for Cape Raz, being distant from thence 18 or 19 leagues, the very same day.

*594-The 20. day we were thwart of Cape Raz.	Cape Raz.



Then we set our course Northwest for Cape S. Marie, Cape S.



which is distant from Cape Raz 19 leagues, and is on the Marie-Eastside of the great Bay of Placentia almost at the entrie thereof.



From thence we shaped our course for the Islands of



S. Pedro passing by the broken Islands of the Martyers: The Islands of and when we were thwart of the said Isles of the Martyers the Martym-our course to the Isles of S. Pedro was West and by The Isles of North. In these Isles of S. Pedro there is a faire harbour, s- Peter' which we went into with our barke, and found there 2 ships of Sibiburo fishing for Cod: where we stayed 2 dayes, and tooke in balest for our ship. There are as faire and tall firre trees growing therein, as in any other part of Newfoundland. Then wee departed thence, and as we came out of the harbours mouth we laid the ship upon the lee, and in 2 houres space we tooke with our hookes 3 or 4 hundred great Cods for our provision of our ship.



Then we departed from the Isle of S. Pedro to enter into the gulffe of S. Laurence betwene Cape Briton and the said Isle, and set our course West North West, and fel with Cape de Rey which wee found to be distant from Cape de Rey. the Isles of S. Pedro 42 leagues. From Cape de Rey to



Cape de Angullie we set our course Northnorthwest being Cape de An-distant thence 12 or 13 leagues. From the Cape de Angullie into the Bay of S. George we ran Northeast The bay of and by East some 18 or 19 leagues.	5amt GeorSe-



In this bay of Saint George, we found the wrackes of 2 great Biskaine ships, which had bene cast away three yeeres before: where we had some seven or eight hundred Whale finnes, and some yron bolts and chaines of their mayne shrouds & fore shroudes: al their traine was beaten out with the weather but the caske remained still. Some part of the commodities were spoiled by tumbling downe of the clifts of the hils, which covered part of the caske, and the greater part of those Whale finnes, which we understood to be there by foure Spaniards which escaped, & were brought to S. John de Luz. Here we

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



found the houses of the Savages, made of firre trees bound together in the top and set round like a Dovehouse, and covered with the barkes of firre trees, wee found also some part of their victuals, which were Deeres flesh roasted upon wooden spits at the fire, & a dish made of a ryne of a tree, sowed together with the sinowes of the Deere, wherein was oile of the Deere. There were also foules called Cormorants, which they had pluckt and made ready to have dressed, and there we found a wooden spoone of their making. And we discerned the tracks of the feete of some fortie or fiftie men, women and children.



When we had dispatched our businesse in this bay of S. George and stayed there ten dayes, wee departed for the Northren point of the said bay, which is nine or ten leagues broade. Then being enformed, that the Whales which are deadly wounded in the grand Bay, and yet escape the fisher for a time, are woont usually to shoot themselves on shore on the Isle of Assumption, or Natis-cotec, which lieth in the very mouth of the great river that runneth up to Canada, we shaped our course over to that long Isle of Natiscotec, and wee found the distance of the way to the Estermost ende thereof to be about forty foure leagues: and it standeth in the latitude of 49. Here we arrived about the middest of June at the East end, and rode in eighteene fadome water in faire white sand and very good ankerage, and for tryall heaved a lyne overboorde and found wonderfull faire and great Cod fish: we went also seven of us on shore and found there exceeding fayre great woods of tall firre trees, and heard and sawe store of land and sea foules, and sawe the footing of divers beastes in the sand when we were on shore. From the Easter end we went to the Norther side of the Island, which we perceived to be but narrow in respect of the length thereof. And after wee had searched two dayes and a night for the Whales which were wounded which we hoped to have found there, and missed of our purpose, we returned backe to the South-

warde, and were within one league of the Island of Penguin, which lyeth South from the Eastermost part of Natiscotec some twelve leagues. From the Isle of Penguin wee shaped our course for Cape de Rey and had sight of the Island of Cape Briton: then returned wee by the Isles of Saint Pedro, and so came into the Bay of Placentia, and arrived in the Easterside thereof some ten leagues up within the Bay among the fishermen of Saint [III. 195.] John de Luz and of Sibiburo and of Biskay, which were to the number of threescore and odde sayles, whereof eight shippes onely were Spaniardes, of whom we were very well used and they wished heartily for peace betweene them and us. There the men of Saint John and Sibiburo men bestowed two pinnesses on us to make up our voyage with fish. Then wee departed over to the other side of the Bay, where we arrived in an harbour which is called Pesmarck, and there made our stage and fished so long, that in the ende the Savages came, and in the night, when our men were at rest, cut both our pinnesse and our shippes boate away to our great hinderance of our voyage, yet it was our good fortune to finde out our pinnesses and get them againe. Then for feare of a shrewder turne of the Savages, we departed for Cape Saint Marie, and having passed Cape Raz, we passed Northwarde fourteene leagues and arrived in Farrillon, and finding there two and twentie sayles of Englishmen, wee made up our fishing voyage to the full in that harborough the twentieth foure of August to our good content: and departing thence we arrived first in Combe and staied there a seven night, and afterward in Hungrod in the river of Bristoll by the grace of God the 24 of September. 1594.
