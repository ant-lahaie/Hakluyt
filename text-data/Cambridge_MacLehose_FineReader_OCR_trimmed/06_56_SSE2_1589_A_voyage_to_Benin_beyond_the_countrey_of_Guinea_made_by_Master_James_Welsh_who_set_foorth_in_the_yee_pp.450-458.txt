A voyage to Benin beyond the Countrey of Guinea, set foorth by Master Bird and Master Newton Marchants of London, with a shippe called the Richard of Arundell, and a Pinesse; Written by James Welsh, who was chiefe Master of the said voyage, begunne in the yeere 1588.



Pon the twelft of October wee wayed our ankers at Ratcliffe and went to Blackwall. And the next day sayling from thence, by reason of contrary winde and weather, wee made it the 25. of October before wee were able to reach Plimouth, and there we stayed (to our great expense of



victuals) for lacke of winde and weather unto the 14. of December.



On Saturday the said 14. of December we put from thence, and about midnight were thwart of the Lizart. Rio del on is	Thursday the second of January wee had sight of the

The thirde of January wee had sight of Cavo de las Barbas, and it bare Southeast five leagues ofF.



The 4. we had sight of the Crosiers in the morning.



Tuesday the 7. day we had sight of Cavo verde, and I finde this place to be in latitude 14. degrees, and 43. minutes, being 4. leagues from the shoare.



Friday the 17. Cavo de Monte bare off us North Northeast, we sounded and had 50. fathom blacke oase, and at 2. of the clocke it bare North Northwest 8. leagues off. And Cavo Mensurado bare of us East and by South, and wee went Northeast with the maine: here the currant setteth to the East Southeast alongst the shoare, and at midnight wee sounded and had 26. fathome blacke oase.



The 18. in the morning we were thwart of a land much like Cavo verde, and it is as I judge 9. leagues from Cavo Mensurado; it is a hill sadlebacked, and there are 4. or 5. one after another: and 7. leagues to the Southward of that, we saw a row of hils sadlebacked also, and from Cavo Mensurado are many mountaines.



The 19. we were thwart Rio de Sestos, and the 20. Cavo dos Baixos was North & by West 4. leagues ofF the shoare, and at afternoone there came a boate from the shoare with 3. Negroes, from a place (as they say) called Tabanoo. And towards evening we were thwart of an Island, and a great many of small Islands or rockes to the Southward, and the currant came out of the Souther-boord: we sounded and had 3 5 fathomes.



The 21. wee had a flat hill that bare North Northeast ofF us, and wee were from the shoare 4. leagues, and at 2. a clocke in the afternoone we spake with a Frenchman riding neere a place called Ratire, and another place hard by called Crua. This Frenchman caried a letter from us to M. Newton: wee layd it on hull while wee were writing of our letter; and the current set us to the Southward a good pase alongst the shoare South Southeast.



The 25. we were in the bight of the bay that is to the Westward of Capo de Tres puntas: the currant did set East Northeast.

Cavo de tres The last of January the middle part of Cape de tres funtas.	puntas was thwart of us three leagues at seven of the



clocke in the morning: and at eight the pinesse came to an anker: and wee prooved that the current setteth to the Eastward: and at sixe at night the uttermost lande bare East and by South 5. leagues, and we went Southwest, and Southwest and by South.



Saturday the first of February 1588. we were thwart of a Round foreland, which I take to be the Eastermost part of Capo de tres puntas: and within the said Round foreland was a great bay with an Island in the said bay.



The Castle of The second of February wee were thwart of the Castle Mtna- of Mina, and when the thirde glasse of our Looke-out was spent, we spied under our Larbord-quarter one of their Boates with certaine Negroes, and one Portugale in [II. ii. 127.] the Boate, wee would have had him to come aboord, but he would not. And over the castle upon the hie rockes Two white we did see as it might be two watch-houses, and they did watch-houses. shew very white: and we went eastnortheast.



The 4 in the morning we were thwart a great high hill, and up into the lande were more high ragged hilles, Monte Re- and those I reckoned to be but little short of Monte dondo. Redondo. Then I reckoned that we were 20 leagues Southeast-ward from the Mina, and at 11 of the clocke I sawe two hilles within the land, these hils I take to be 7 leagues from the first hils. And to sea-ward of these hilles is a bay, and at the east end of the bay another hill, and from the hils the landes lie verie low. We went Eastnortheast, and East and by North 22 leagues, and then East along the shore.



Villa longa. The 6 we were short of Villa longa, and there we met with a Portugall Caravell.



The 7 a faire temperate day, and all this day we road before Villa longa.



The 8 at noone we set saile from Villa longa, and 452



1589-ten leagues from thence we ankered againe and stayed all that night in ten fadom water.



The 9 we set saile, and all alongst the shore were very thicke woodes, and in the afternoone we were thwart a river, & to the Eastward of the river a litle way off Rio de Lagos, was a great high bush-tree as though it had no leaves, and at night we ankered with faire and temperate weather.



The 10 we set sayle and went East, and East and by South 14 leagues along the shoare, which was so full of thicke woods, that in my judgement a man should have much to doe to passe through them, and towards night we ankered in 7 fadome with faire weather.



The 11 we sayled East and by South, and three leagues from the shore we had but 5 fadome water, and all the wood upon the land was as even as if it had beene cut with a paire of gardeners sheeres, and in running of two leagues we descerned a high tuft of trees upon the brow of a land, which shewed like a Porpose head, and when wee came at it, it was but part of the lande, and a league further we saw a head-land very low and full of trees, and a great way from the land we had very shallow water, Very shallow then we lay South into the sea, because of the sands for water-to get into the deepe water, and when we found it deepe, we ankered in five fadom thwart the river of Jaya, in the rivers mouth.



The 12 in the morning we road still in the rivers mouth. This day we sent the pinnesse and the boat on land with the marchants, but they came not againe untill the next morning. The shallowest part of this river is toward the West, where there is but 4 fadom and a halfe, and it is very broad. The next morning came the boate aboord, and they also said it was Rio de Jaya. Rio de Jaya. Here the currant setteth Westward, and the Eastermost land is higher then the Westermost.



Thursday the 13 we set saile, and lay South Southeast along the shore, where the trees are wonderfull even, and the East shore is higher then the West shore, and when wee had sayled 18 leagues we had sight of a great river,



453

The 15 we sent the boat and pinnesse into the river with the marchants, and after that we set saile, because we road in shallow water, and went Southsoutheast, and the starbord tacke aboord untill we came to five fathom A currant water, where we road with the currant to the Westward: Westward. then came our boat out of the harbour and went aboord the pinnesse. The West part of the land was high browed much like the head of a Gurnard, and the Easter-most land was lower, and had on it three tufts of trees like stackes of wheate or corne, and the next day in the morning we sawe but two of those trees, by reason that we went more to the Eastward. And here we road still from the 14 of Februarie untill the 14 of Aprill, with the winde at Southwest.



The 16 of Februarie we rode still in 5 fadome, and the currant ranne still to the Westward, the winde at Southwest, and the boat and pinnesse came to us againe Tenfoote out of the river, and told us that there was but ten foote ^t^b^Tof water uPon the barre. All that night was drowsie, and Rio de Benin. reasonable temperate.



The 17 a close day the winde at Southwest. Our marchants wayed their goods and put them aboord the pinnesse to goe into the river, and there came a great currant out of the river and set to the Westward.

The 30 our pinnesse came from Benin, and brought sorowfull newes, that Thomas Hemsted was dead and our Captaine also, and she brought with her 159 Cerons or sackes of pepper and Elephants teeth.



Note that in all the time of our abiding here, in the mouth of the river of Benin, and in all the coast hereabout it is faire temperate weather, when the winde is at Southwest. And when the winde is at Northeast and Northerly, then it raineth, with lightning and thunder, and is very intemperate weather.



The 13 of Aprill 1589 we set saile homewards in the name of Jesus. In the morning we sayled with the winde at Southwest, and lay West and by North, but it prooved calme all that night, and the currant Southeast.



The 14 the river of Benin was Northeast 7 leagues from the shore, and there was litle winde and towards night calme.



The 17 a faire temperate day the winde variable, and we had of latitude foure degrees and 20 minutes.

The 8 of May we had sight of the shore, which was part of Cavo de Monte, but we did not thinke we had beene so farre, but it came so to passe by reason of the currant. In this place M. Towrson was in like maner deceived with the currant.

The commodities that we caried in this voyage were cloth both linnen & wollen, yron worke of sundry sorts, 456



. . . 15891 Manillios or bracelets of copper, glasse beades, and corrall.



The commodities that we brought home were pepper and Elephants teeth, oyle of palme, cloth made of Cotton wooll very curiously woven, and cloth made of the barke of palme trees. Their money is pretie white [II. ii. 129.] shels, for golde and silver we saw none. They have also great store of cotton growing: their bread is a kind of roots, they call it Inamia, and when it is well sodden Inamla,akind I would leave our bread to eat of it, it is pleasant in °fbrfa<lin eating, and light or digestion, the roote thereof is as bigge as a mans arme. Our men upon fish-dayes had rather eate the rootes with oyle and vineger, then to eate good stockfish. There are great store of palme trees, out of the which they gather great store of wine, Wine °f which wine is white and very pleasant, & we should buy tiees' two gallons of it for 20 shels. They have good store of sope, and it smelleth like beaten violets. Also many pretie fine mats and baskets that they make, and spoones of Elephants teeth very curiously wrought with divers proportions of foules and beasts made upon them. There is upon the coast wonderfull great lightning and thunder, in so much as I never hard the like in no Countrey, for it would make the decke or hatches tremble under our feete, and before we were well acquainted with it, we were fearefull, but God be thanked we had no harme.



The people are very gentle and loving, and they goe naked both men and women untill they be married, and then they goe covered from the middle downe to the Abundance of knees. They would bring our men earthen pottes of hony. the quantitie of two gallons, full of hony and hony Thispreser-combes for 100 shelles. They would also bring great va11™6 ™ store of Oranges and Plantans which is a fruit that casting into an groweth upon a tree, and is very like unto a Cucumber hogshead of but very pleasant in eating. It hath pleased God of water an his merceifull goodnesse to give me the knowledge how to preserve fresh water with little cost, which did serve the author told us sixe moneths at the sea, & when we came into Plim- me.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES mouth it was much wondered at, of the principal men of the towne, who said that there was not sweeter water in any spring in Plimouth. Thus doth God provide for his creatures, unto whom be praise now and for evermore, Amen.
