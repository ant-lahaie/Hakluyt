Certaine reasons to disswade the use of a trade to the Narve aforesaide, by way through Sweden.



THe merchandise of the Narve are grosse wares, viz. flaxe, hempe, waxe, tallow and hides.



The traffique at that place standeth upon the agreement and liking of the Emperour of Russia, with the king of Sweden : for all these merchandises that are brought thither come from Plescove, Novogrod, and other parts of the Emperours dominions.



For transporting those merchandises from Narve to Stockholm, or what other place shall bee thought convenient in Sweden, it must be in vessels of those countries, which wilbe of smal force to resist Freebooters, or any other that shall make quarel or offer violence against them.



When the goods are brought into Sweden, they must be discharged, and new laden into smaller vessels, to cary the same by river or lake a part of the way, and againe to be unladen and transported by land to Newles.



So as the ordinary charges for transporting of goods from Narve to Newles by way as aforesaid, besides the spoile by so often lading and unlading, cariage by land, and the dangers of the seas, pirats, &c. will be such as when it shalbe so brought to Newles it wil be as deare to the merchants in that place as it shall be worth to be sold in London, wherefore the trade that wayes cannot be profitable to our nation.



Moreover, when the goods shall be in Newles, it may Note. bee thought doubtfull to bring it thence quietly without disliking or forcible resistance of the king of Denmarke, forasmuch as he maketh quarell, and alleageth damage unto him in his toiles of the Sound by our trade to S. Nicholas, how much more will he now doe by this way, and with how much greater advantage may he

performe it ? The danger that may grow in our trade to Russia by way of S. Nicholas, through the displeasure that the Emperour may conceive by our trade with the Sweden to Narve is also to be considered.
