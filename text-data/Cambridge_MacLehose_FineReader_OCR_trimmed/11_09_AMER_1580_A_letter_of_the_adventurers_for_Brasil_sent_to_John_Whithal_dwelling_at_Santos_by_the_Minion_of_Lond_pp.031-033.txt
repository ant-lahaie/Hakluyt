A copie of the letters of the Adventurers for Brasill sent to John WhithalL dwelling in Santos, by the Minion of London. Anno 1580. the 24. of October in London.



Aster Whithall, as unacquainted wee commend us unto you, &c. understanding by your friends, M. John Bird, M. Robert Walkaden, and your brother James Whithall of certaine letters that they have received of yours from Santos, which wee have seene and



read, wherein from time to time you doe require, and desire them to send a good ship to Santos, with such wares and commodities: as you did write for, whereby you did not onely promise that they should have good intertainment, but also should sell the saide commodities to make three of one outward at the least in every thing, and that for to relade their ship backe, they should have of the best, finest, & whitest drie sugars 32. pound of our weight for a ducket at the most. The premises considered, with the great credit that they and we doe give to your writing & promise, have caused us, whose names be hereunder written, to joyne our selves in company together, & to be at great charges purposely to send this good ship the Minion of London, not onely with such marchandizes as you wrote for, but also with as many other things as we thought might any wayes pleasure you, or profit the country. And we crave of you, that we and our factors may have so much credite of you, as we have in you and of your letters, which is to beleeve us that we have taken this voyage upon us, with no other minde or purpose, then to deale faithfully and truely in the trade by sea and land, so as you shall not onely have cause to rejoyce, and deserve thanks for our comming, but also you wil procure the magistrates 31



there to be bound, as they use in Galicia, that we may be preserved and defended from all reprisals and imbargments of princes or subjects for any causes or matters whatsoever, whereby wee may bee incouraged by them, giving us this securitie of good intertain-ment, to continue the trade yeerely henceforth: and for our parts we promise upon our credits and fidelities, to commit no outrage at the sea nor land, nor suffer any to be done in our company that we may let, but rather to defend and protect all other such peaceable marchants as we are, with their ships and goods.



[III. 704.] And to the ende that you and others shall know that wee meane as we say, we have given order to our factours to give you good hostages for your assurance of our good fidelities: and further we have sent a testimoniali of our owne true meaning in writing under the seales of this honourable Citie of London, which we wil not discredite by our behaviours for all the treasure that you have: and so we have written to your magistrates of your port, and others in Spanish, the copy whereof we send you herewith enclosed in English. And if the time should fal out so contrary to our expectations, that there should not be fine white sugar sufficient to lade our said ship in due time at Santos, then we pray you direct our factours where they may goe with the shippe in safetie to supply their want, and helpe them to a good sure Pilot for that purpose, and write your letters to your friends where the best sugar is made in their favours, and helpe our factours to have a testimoniali from Santos, that they and you traded together friendly, and so departed in good and perfect amitie, and shew them that the just cause of our com-ming is to trade as marchants peaceably, and not as Pirats to commit any offence to one or other.



Also we pray you, if there be any store of waxe, or salt-peeter, whereby the price there may yeeld us as 32



much profit as the white sugars at a ducket the rove, or any other commodity of like profile, then to procure that we may lade it without danger of lawe, be it oare of golde or silver or whatsoever else.

Wee have sent you copper cauldrons for your Ingenios, with iron and all other necessaries for your purpose, and artificers to set the same: and as wee have at your request bene at great charges in sending these men, so we pray you let us have lawful favour in like courtesie to further all our causes. And if any of our Mariners or passengers in any respect of displeasure against their company, or in hope of preferment of mariage or otherwise would procure to tary and dwell there, and leave his charge and office, that then you will be a meane to the Justice that such fugitives should bee sent abord the ship as prisoners: for as you know, without our men wee cannot bring home our ship.



Wee have given order to our factours to use your counsell and helpe in their affaires, and to gratifie you for the same as to your courtesie and faithfull friendship shall appertaine to your good liking: and in the meane time for a token of our good willes toward you, we have sent you a fieldbed of walnut tree, with the canopy, valens, curtaines, and gilt knops. And if there be any com-moditie else that may pleasure you or your friends, wee have given order that they shall have the refusing of it before any other, giving for it as it is worth.



And thus to conclude, promising to performe all the foresaide things on our parts in every condition, we commit you to God, who ever preserve you with all his



blessings.



Your loving friends
