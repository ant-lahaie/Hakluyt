[I. 303.] A Letter of Master Richard Gray one of the first Agents of the Moscovie companie to Master Henrie Lane at Mosco, written in i558-	Colmogro the 19. of Februarie 1558.



WOrshipfull Sir, after heartie commendations &c.



You shall understand that this Lent commeth Lampas a to Lampas such a number of men of divers nations great mart fir wÂ£th wareS} as hath not bene seene these ten yeeres. tk^North Thither come many out of Ugori : therefore I would have bene there my selfe, and also have received such money as is owing us in wares by Kerill his brother and Osep Boscovo. For as you well know, thence they will goe with their wares to the Mosco, and make us payment with delayes, as they have done these other yeeres past. Colobone and his partner be departed towards Lampas with seven sleddes laden with victuals. Others also are gone to that Mart. As touching the bringing of money with you, it will bee good, for I assure you since our comming to this countrey have not so many persons gone to the Sea, as will doe this yeere. Trusting that God will send good store of traine oyle, I will cause as much caske to bee in a readinesse as I can, if you shall thinke it meete to send some money before. All

our olde hempe is spunne and wrought in tenne cables from fifteene ynches to ten the least, and thirteene Hausers from sixe ynches to three ynches: and all may weigh white eight and twenty thousande pounde weight and upwarde. There is in hempe ockam five thousand pound two hundred weight in twelve sackes at the least: the flaxe that came downe in the Nassadaes with those seven podes that came last is all spunne with a good part of that hempe that came last. God send more shortly, for all that is here and that is comming in the three other sleddes, will bee dispatched by the fourth weeke in Lent. Within these few dayes I bought thirteen podes, seven pound of hempe that cost two robles, twenty eight altines, foure pence, which together with that that was bought before, shall bee laide in dipping and sounding lines, for it is very good. There are spent above fiftie barrels of tarre alreadie: you shall What quanti-understand that these eight workemen will spinne ^afhempeZ. and lay above fourescore and tenne thousand pound of hempe, so it bee dressed readie to their hands, yeere. having two to turne the wheeles, and two to winde up. Therefore I have agreed with these two boyes to serve the worshipfull companie foure yeeres a piece. One of them windeth up and is very apt to spinne: therefore I will have two other young men Russes to spinne, if they can finde good sureties for their trueth. I have bene in hand with these two yong men that came out of the Trinitie, and they with me, but under seven pound a yeere they will not serve, nor Thomas Bunting that was Roger Bunting his servant. Therefore I would have three Russes at the least to spinne, five of them will be as good as these three, and will not be so chargeable all, as one of these would be. I thinke it were good that our Nassada were somewhat strengthened in her floore on both sides with plankes of five or sixe ynches thicke, from the stemme to the sterne, as I have written to Thomas Hawtrey at

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



Vologda. Also if you shall so thinke meet, your waxe and tallowe shall bee laden in two Dosnickes, for they bee meete to goe aboord the shippes: I doe intend to set up an house at Boroseva over against the place whereas the shippes shall ride, your advise therein I expect, it shall not cost above three robles, and yet if we will, there shall be two warme roomes in it. As for other matter at this present I have not to trouble you withall, and if it would please you I would be glad to heare some good newes of Master Jenkinson. Thus Jesus be with you and be his guide.



Postscriptum.



As for these our Hawkes they bee not white, but white and mayled, but indeede are Jarfawkons. These dayes past our Olen died. So this yeere our Masters of the companie are like to have none, nor any white beares. Neither may any passe out of the realme without a special licence from the Emperour.



I intend God willing to goe to Lampas, if I doe I will take foure or five kerseys with me, but as for money there is small store here to carie.



Yours, Richard Gray.
