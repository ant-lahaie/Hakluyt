A letter of directions of the English Ambassadour to M. Richard Forster, appointed the first English Consuli at Tripolis in Syria.



Ousin Forster, these few words are for your remembrance when it shall please the Almighty to send you safe arrivall in Tripolis of Syria. When it shall please God to send you thither, you are to certifie our Nation at Tripolis of the certaine day of your landing, to the end



they both may have their house in a readinesse, and also meet you personally at your entrance to accompany you, being your selfe apparelled in the best maner. The next, second, or third day, after your comming, give it out that you be crazed and not well disposed, by meanes of your travell at Sea, during which time, you and those there are most wisely to determine in what maner you are to present your selfe to the Beglerbi, Cadi, and other officers : who every of them are to be presented according to the order accustomed of others formerly in like office : which after the note of John Blanke, late Vice-consull of Tripolis for the French, delivered you 261



heerewith, is very much : and therefore, if thereof you can save any thing, I pray you doe it, as I doubt not but you will. They are to give you there also another Janizarie according as the French hath ; whose outward proceedings you are to imitate and follow, in such sort as you bee not his inferiour, according as those of our Nation heeretofore with him resident can informe you. Touching your demeanour after your placing, you are wisely to proceede considering both French and Venetian will have an envious eye on you : whome if they perceive wise and well advised, they will feare to offer you any injurie. But if they shall perceive any insufficiencie in you, they will not omitte any occasion to harme you. They are subtile, malicious, and dissembling people, wherefore you must alwayes have their doings for suspected, and warily walke in all your actions : wherein if you call for Gods divine assistance, as doth become every faithfull good Christian, the same shall in such sort direct you as he shall be glorified, your selfe preserved, your doings blessed, and your enemies confounded. Which if contrarywise you omit and forget, your enemies malice shalbe satisfied with your confusion, which God defend, and for his mercies sake keepe you. Touching any outlopers of our nation, which may happen to come thither to traffike, you are not to suffer, but to imprison the chiefe officers, and suffer the rest not to traffike at any time, and together enter in such bonds as you thinke meete, that both they shall not deale in the Grand Signiors dominions, and also not harme, during their voyage, any his subjects shippes, vessels, or whatsoever other, but quietly depart out of the same country without any harme doing. And touching those there for the company, you are to defend them according to your priviledge & such commandements as you have had hence, in the best order you may. In all and every your actions, at any hand, beware of rashnesse and anger, after both which repentance followeth. Touching your dealings in their affaires of marchandise, you are not to deale 262



otherwise then in secret and counsell. You are carefully to foresee the charge of the house, that the same may be in all honest measure to the companies profit and your owne health through moderation in diet, and at the best hand, and in due time to provide things needfull, to save what may be : for he that buyeth every thing when he needeth it, harmeth his owne house, and helpeth the retailer. So as it is, in mine opinion, wisdome to foresee the buying of all things in their native soile, in due time, and at the first hand every yeere, as you are to send the company the particular accounts of the same expenses. Touching your selfe, you are to cause to be employed fifty or threescore ducats, videlicet, twenty in Sope, and the rest in Spices, whereof the most part to be Pepper, whereof we spend very much. The Spices are to be provided by our friend William Barrat, and the Sope buy you at your first arrivall, for that this shippe lading the same commodity will cause it to amount in price. From our mansion Rapamat, the fift of September 1583.
