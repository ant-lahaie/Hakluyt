To the most renowmed prince and mighty Lord, Henrie king of England &c. our gracious Lord.



OUr humble recommendations, with our most instant and continuall prayers for you being graciously by your Majestie taken in good part 8cc. Most soveraigne king, mighty prince, gratious lord, and unto us most unfaynedly beloved, we received of late your gracious letters by your Majesties liege subject John Brown, the contents wherof seemed to be these following: first that of long time heretofore, there have bene between the marchants of your realm & of our lands, not only quiet & peaceable accesse one unto another, but also mutual participation, & common traffique of their wares, being right commodious & availeable for them both: howbeit, that now the foresaid profitable conversation, by reason of certain notorious robberies, committed upon the sea by pyrates against both parts, 8c the wonted accesse also of your subjects unto our dominions, were altogether forbidden. Moreover, you call to remembrance the ancient amity 8c friendship betweene both our lands, with the invaluable commodity of sweet amiable peace, which are by al faithful Christians, to the utmost of their endevour to be imbraced. Wherupon you of your exceeding clemency, do offer your Majesties fill consent, that the foresaid prohibition being released until the feast of Easter next ensuing, the said marchants of your dominions may in our territories, and our marchants likewise may in your realms (al molestations ceasing) exercise their woonted traffique: especially sithens in the mean season your royall wisdome hath determined to direct unto us your hono: ambassadors in friendly sort to treat and parle with us as touching the pretended injuries, so far forth as they may concerne your subjects. Adding moreover in particular that when your people shall repayre unto the parts of Sconia to fish for herrings, having consideration & regard unto



your majestie, we would have them especially recommended unto our protection &c. Most soveraigne lord & king, & gracious prince, wee doe with unfained and hearty affection embrace the oracles of your majesties most courteous & acceptable offer : wherein you have used most diligent & effectuall perswasions, that complement of justice should be done unto the parties injuried, & that peace & friendship should take place, making no doubt of your own royall person, nor of our selves or of any appertayning unto us, but that our inclinations and desires in this regarde are all one and the same : neither would we lightly transgresse the limits of your perswasions without some just, weighty, & reasonable cause, forasmuch as the matters perswaded are in very [I. 161.J deede most happy preservatives of a common weale, yea 8c of nature it selfe. Moreover whereas your highnes hath farther requested us, that the prohibition of your subjects accesse unto our dominions might, untill the feast of Easter next ensuing, be released : we answere (under correction of your majesties more deliberate counsell) that it is farre more expedient for both parts to have the sayd prohibition continued then released, until such time as satisfaction be performed on both sides unto the parties endamaged, not in words only, but actually 8c really in deeds, or by some course of law or friendly composition. For there is no equall nor indifferent kinde of consort or trade between the impoverished party and him that is inriched, betweene the partie which hath obtayned justice and him that hath obtayned none between the offender and the party offended : because they are not mooved with like affections. For the remembrance of injuries easily stirreth up inconsiderate motions of anger. Also, such a kind of temperature or permixtion, as it were, by way of contrariety breedeth more bitternes then sweetnes, more hate then love : whereupon more grievous complaints aswel unto your highnes as unto our selves, might be occasioned. The lord knoweth, that even now we are too



much wearied and disquieted with the importunate and instant complaints of our subjects, insomuch that wee cannot at this present by any convenient meanes release or dissolve the sayd prohibition, before wee be sufficiently informed by your majesties ambassadors, of the satisfaction of our endamaged subjects. Furthermore, whereas your majesties request, concerning your subjects that shal come unto the parts of Sconia, is that we would defend them under our protection : be it knowen unto your highnes, that for divers considerations us reasonably Margaret moving, being provoked by the queene of Denmarke ^Denm an^ ber PeoP^e> being also urged thereunto full sore ' against our wils, for the repelling and avoiding of injuries, we have sent forth our armie against them. Howbeit for a certaine time a truce is concluded on both parts, so that our people are actually returned home. Farre be it from us also, that our subjects being occupied in warres, should in any sort willingly molest or reproch any strangers, of what landes or nations soever, not being our professed enemies. For this should be to oppresse the innocent in stead of the guilty, to condemne the just for the unjust : then which nothing can be more cruel, nor a revenge of greater impietie. In very deede (most gracious prince and lorde) we are moved with right hearty sympathy and compassion for any inconvenience which might happen in your regiment: wishing from the bottome of our hearts, that all affayres may right prosperously and happily succeede, about the royall person and regiment of your most excellent Majestic, and that continually. The like whereof wee hope from you : most humbly commending our selves, and our whole Order unto your highnes. Given at our castle of Marienburgh, the 16. day the moneth of July, in the yere of our Lord 1404.
