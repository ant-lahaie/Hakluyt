Bidem tunc affuere etiam Henrici Regis Angliae missi, varia & preciosa donaria multo lepore verborum adornata praestantes. Inter quae papilionem unum quantitate maximum, qualitate optimum perspeximus. Cujus si quantitatem requiris, non nisi machinis & instru-



mentorum genere & adminiculo levari poterat: si qualitatem, nec materia nec opere ipsum putem aliquando ab aliquo hujusce apparatu superatum iri. Literas quoque mellito sermone plenas pariter direxerat, quarum hic tenor fuit. Praecordiali amico suo, Frederico Dei gratia Romanorum imperatori invictissimo, Henricus Rex Angliae, dux Normanniae, & Aquitania?, & Comes Andegavensis, salutem, & verae dilectionis concordiam. Excellentiae vestrae quantas possumus referimus grates, dominantium optime, quod nos nunciis vestris visitare, salutare literis, muneribus praevenire, & quod his charius amplectimur, pacis & amoris invicem dignatus estis foedera inchoare. Exultavimus, & quodammodo animum nobis crescere, & in majus sensimus evehi dum vestra promissio, in qua nobis spem dedistis, in disponendis Regni nostri negociis, alacriores nos reddidit, & promptiores. Exultavimus inquam, & tota mente magnificentiae vestrae assurreximus, id vobis in sincero cordis affectu respondentes, quod quicquid ad honorem vestrum spectare noverimus, pro posse nostro effectui mancipare 316



parati sumus. Regnum nostrum, & quicquid ubique nostras subjicitur ditioni vobis exponimus & vestrae committimus potestati, ut ad vestrum nutum omnia disponantur, & in omnibus vestri fiat voluntas imperii. Sit igitur inter nos & populos nostros dilectionis & pacis unitas indivisa, commercia tuta : Ita tamen ut vobis, qui dignitate praeminetis, imperandi cedat authori-tas, nobis non deerit voluntas obsequendi. Et sicut vestrae Serenitatis memoriam vestrorum excitat in nobis

Commercia inter Germanos W Anglos.



munerum largitio, sic vos nostri quoque reminisci praeoptamus, mittentes quae pulchriora penes nos erant, & vobis magis placitura. Attendite itaque dantis affectum, non data, & eo animo quo dantur accipite. De manu beati Jacobi, super qua nobis scripsistis, in ore magistri Hereberti & Guilielmi Clerici nostri verbum posuimus. Teste Thoma Cancellario apud Northanton.



The same in English.



THere were present also the same time, the messengers of Henry king of England presenting divers rich and precious gifts, and that with great learning & eloquence of speech. Amongst the which we saw a pavilion, most large in quantity, & most excellent in quality. For if you desire to know the quanti tie therof, it could not be erected without engines and a kinde of instruments, and maine force : if the qualitie, I thinke there was never any furniture of the same kinde, that surpassed the same either in stuffe or workemanship. The said king directed his letters also, full of sugred speeches, the tenour whereof was this that folioweth.



To his entirely beloved friend Frederick by the grace of God Emperour of the Romanes most invincible, Henry king of England, duke of Normandie and Aquitaine, Earle of Anjou wisheth health and concord of sincere amitie. We doe render unto your highnes (most renowmed and peerelesse Prince) exceeding great thanks for that you have so graciously vouchsafed by your messengers to visite us, in your letters to salute 3r7



us, with your gifts to prevent us, and (which wee doe more highly esteeme of then all the rest) to beginne a league of peace and friendship betweene us. We rejoyced, and in a maner sensibly felt our selves to bee greatly emboldened, and our courage to encrease, whilest your promise, whereby you put us in good comfort, did make us more cheerefull and resolute, in managing the affaires of our kingdome. We rejoyced (I say) & in our secret cogitations did humble obeisance unto your Majestie, giving you at this time to understand from the sincere 8c unfained affection of our heart, that whatsoever we shal know to tend unto your honour, we are, to our power most ready to put in practise. Our kingdome, and whatsoever is under our jurisdiction we doe offer unto you, and commit the same unto your highnesse, that all matters may be disposed according to your direction, and that your pleasure may in all things be fulfilled. Let there be therefore betweene our selves and our subjects, an indivisible unitie of friendship and peace, and safe trade of Marchandize: yet so, as that unto you (who excell in dignitie) authoritie in commanding may bee ascribed, and diligence in obeying shall not want in us. And as the liberalitie of your rewards doeth often put us in remembrance of your Majestie, even so in like maner sending unto [I. 129.] your Highnesse the most rare things in our custodie, and which we thought should be most acceptable unto you, wee doe most heartily wish that your selfe also would not altogether bee unmindefull of us. Have respect therefore not unto the gifts, but unto the affection of the giver, and accept of them with that minde, wherewith they are offered unto you.



Concerning the hand of S. James, about which you wrote unto us, we have sent you word by M. Herbert, and by William the Clerke. Witnes Thomas our Chancelour at Northanton.
