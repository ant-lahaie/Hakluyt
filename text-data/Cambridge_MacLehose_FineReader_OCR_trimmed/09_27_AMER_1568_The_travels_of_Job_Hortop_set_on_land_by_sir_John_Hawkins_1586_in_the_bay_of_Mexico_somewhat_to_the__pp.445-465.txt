The travailes of Job Hortop, which Sir John Hawkins set on land within the Bay of Mexico, after his departure from the Haven of S. John de Ullua in Nueva Espanna, the 8. of October 1568.



Ot untruely nor without cause said Job the faithfull servant of God (whom the sacred Scriptures tell us, to have dwelt in the land of Hus) that man being borne of a woman, living a short time, is replenished with many miseries : which some know by reading of histories, many



by the view of others calamities, and I by experience in my selfe, as this present Treatise insuing shall shew. It is not unknowen unto many, that I Job Hortop pouder-maker was borne at Bourne, a towne in Lincolnshire, from my age of twelve yeeres brought up in Red-riffe neere London, with M. Francis Lee, who was the Queenes Majesties powder-maker, whom I served, until I was prest to go on the 3. voyage to the West Indies, with the right worshipful Sir John Hawkins, who appointed me to be one of the Gunners in her Majesties ship called the Jesus of Lubeck, who set saile from Plimmouth in the moneth of October 1567. having with him another ship of her Majesties, called the Minion, and foure ships of his owne, namely the Angel, the Swallow, the Judith, and the William and John. He directed his Vice-admiral, that if foule weather did separate them, to meete at the Hand of Tenerif. After which by the space of seven dayes and seven nights, we had such storm es at sea, that we lost our long boats and a pinnesse, with some men: comming to the Isle of 445

Tenerif, there our general heard that his Vice-admirall with the Swallow, and the William and John were at the Hand called Gomera, where finding his Vice-admirall, he anchored, tooke in fresh water, and set saile for Cape Blank, where in the way wee tooke a Portugal caravel, laden with fish called Mullets: from thence we sailed to cape Verde. In our course thither we met a Frenchman of Rochel called captaine Bland, who had taken a Portugal caravel, whom our vice admiral chased and tooke. Captaine Drake, now Sir Francis Drake was made master & captaine of the Caravel, and so we kept our way till we came to Cape Verde, and there we anchored, tooke our boates, & set souldiers on shore. Our general was the first that leapt on land, & with him Captaine Dudley: there we tooke certaine Negroes, but not without damage to our selves. For our general, Captaine Dudley, & 8. other of our company were hurt with poysoned arrowes: about nine dayes after, the 8. that were wounded died. Our general was taught by a Negro, to draw the poyson out of his wound with a clove of garlike, whereby he was cured. From thence wee went to Sierra leona, where be monstrous fishes called Sharkes, which will devoure men. I amongst others was sent in the Angell with two Pin-nesses into the river called Calousa, to seeke two Caravels thaf were there trading with the Negros: wee tooke one of them with the Negros, and brought them away.



In this river in ye night time we had one of our pin-nesses bulged by a sea-horse, so that our men swimming about the river, were all taken into the other pinnesses, except two that tooke hold one of another, and were caried away by the sea-horse. This monster hath the just proportion of a horse, saving that his legs be short, his teeth very great, and a span in length: hee useth in the night to goe on land into the woods, seeking at unawares to devoure the Negroes in their cabbins, whom they by their vigilancie prevent, and kill him in this maner. The Negroes keepe watch, and diligently attend their comming, and when they are gone into the woods, 446



they forthwith lay a great tree overthwart the way, so that at their returne, for that their legs be so short, they cannot goe over it: then the Negroes set upon them with their bowes, arrowes and darts, and so destroy them.



From thence we entred the river called the Casserroes, where there were other Caravels trading with the Negroes, and them we tooke. In this Hand betwixt the river and the maine, trees grow with Oisters upon them. There grow Palmito trees, which bee as high as a ships maine mast, and on their tops grow nuts, wine and oyle, which they call Palmito wine and Palmito oyle. The Plantan tree also groweth in that countrey; the tree is as bigge as a mans thigh, and as high as a firre pole, the leaves thereof be long and broad, and on the top grow the fruit which are called Plantanos: they are crooked, and a cubite long, and as bigge as a mans wrist, they growe on clusters: when they be ripe they be very good and daintie to eate: Sugar is not more delicate in taste then they be.



From thence with the Angel, the Judith, and the two pinn esses, we sailed to Sierra leona, where our general at that time was, who with the captaines and souldiers went up into the river called Taggarin, to take a towne of The river of the Negroes, where he found three kings of that countrey Taggarin. with fiftie thousand Negroes besieging the same towne, which they could not take in many yeeres before, when they had warred with it. Our General made a breach, entred & valiantly tooke the towne, wherein were found five Portugals which yeelded themselves to his mercy, and hee saved their lives: we tooke & caried thence for traffique to the West Indies 500. Negroes. The three 5°°- Negroes kings drove 7000. Negroes into ye sea at low water, ta^en' at the point of the land, where they were all drowned in the Oze, for that they could not take their canoas to save themselves. Wee returned backe againe in our pinnesses to the ships, and there tooke in fresh water, and made ready sayle towards Rio grande. At our comming thither Rio grande. we entred with the Angel, the Judith, and the 2 pinnesses,

Burboroata.



THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



and found there seven Portugal Carvels, which made great fight with us. In the ende by Gods helpe wee wonne the victory, and drove them to the shore, from whence with the Negroes they fled, and we fetcht the carvels from the shore into the river. The next morning M. Francis Drake with his carvel, the Swallow, and the William and John came into the river, with captaine Dudley and his souldiers, who landed being but a hundred souldiers, and fought with seven thousand Negroes, burned the towne, and returned to our general with the losse of one man.



In that place there be many muske-cats, which breed in hollow trees: the Negroes take them in a net, & put them in a cage, & nourish them very daintily, & take the muske from them with a spoone.



Now we directed our course from Guinea towards the West Indies.



And by the way died Captaine Dudley.



In sayling towards the Indies, the first land that we escryed, was the Hand called Dominica, where at our comming we ancored, & tooke in fresh water and wood for our provision: which done, we sayled towards the Hand called Margarita, where our general in despite of the Spaniards anchored, landed, & tooke in fresh victuals. A mile ofF the Hand there is a rocke in the sea, wherein doe breede many fowles like unto Barnacles: in the night we went out in our boates, and with cudgels we killed many of them, and brought them with many of their egs aboord with us: their egges be as bigge as Turkies egges, and speckled like them. We did eate them, and found them very good meate.



From thence wee sayled to Burboroata, which is in the maine land of the West Indies: there we came in, mored our ships, and taried two moneths trimming and dressing our ships, and in the meane time traded with certaine Spanyards of that countrey. There our general sent us unto a towne called Placencia, (which stood on a high hil) to have intreated a Bishop that dwelt there for 448



i56& his favour & friendship in their lawes, who hearing of our comming, for feare forsooke ye town.



In our way up the hil to Placencia, wee found a Placencia in monstrous venemous worme with two heads: his body the maine, was as bigge as a mans arme, and a yard long: our master Robert Barret did cut him in sunder with his sword, and it made it as blacke as if it were coloured with ynke.



Heere be many Tygers, monstrous and furious beasts, which by subtiltie devoure and destroy many men: they use the traded wayes, & wil shew themselves twise or thrise to the travellers, and so depart secretly, lurking till they be past, then suddenly & at unawares they leape upon them and devoure them: they had so used two of our [III. 489.] company, had not one of them looked behind. Our general sent three ships unto the Hand called Coragao, to make provision for the rest, where they remayned untill his comming. Hee sent from thence the Angel and the Judith to Rio de Hacha, where we anchored before the town. The Spaniards shot three pieces at us from the shore, whom we requited with two of ours, and shotte through the Governours house: we wayed anchor, & anchored againe without shot of the towne, where wee rid five dayes in despite of the Spanyards and their shot. In the mean space there came a Carvel of advise from S. Domingo, whom with the Angel, and the Judith wee chased and drove to the shore: we fetcht him from thence in spite of 200. Spaniards hargubush shot, and anchored againe before the towne, and rid there with them, till our Generals comming, who anchored, landed his men, and valiantly tooke the Towne, with the losse of one man, Rio de la whose name was Thomas Surgeon: wee landed and ^acJia taken, planted on the shore for our safeties, our field ordinance: we drove the Spaniards up into the country above two leagues, whereby they were inforced to trade with our General, to whom he sold most part of his Negros.



In this river we killed a monstrous Lagarto or Crocodile in this port at sunne set: seven of us went in the

pinnesse up into the River, carying with us a dogge, unto whom with ropeyarne we bound a great hooke of steele, with a chaine that had a swivel, which we put under the dogs belly, the point of the hooke comming over his back fast bound, as aforesaid: we put him over boord, and vered out our rope by litle and litle, rowing away with our boate: the Lagarto came & presently swallowed up the dogge, then did we rowe hard, till we had choked him: he plunged and made a wonderful stirre in the water: we leapt on shore, and haled him on land: he was 23. foote by the rule, headed like a hogge, in body like a serpent, full of scales as broad as a sawcer: his taile long and full of knots as bigge as a fawcon shotte: he hath foure legs, his feete have long nailes like unto a dragon: we opened him, tooke out his guts, flayed him, dried his skinne, and stuffed it with straw, meaning to have brought it home, had not the ship bin cast away. This monster will cary away and devoure both man and horse.



From hence we shaped our course to Santa Martha, where we landed, traded, and sold certaine Negroes: there two of our company killed a monstrous adder, going towards his cave with a Conie in his mouth: his body was as bigge as any mans thigh, and seven foote long: upon his tayle he had sixteene knottes, every one as bigge as a great walnut, which they say, doe shew his age: his colour was greene and yellow: they opened him, and found two conies in his belly.



From thence wee sayled to Cartagena, where we went in, mored our Shippes, and would have traded with them, but they durst not for feare of the King: wee brought up the Minion against the Castle, and shotte at the Castle and Towne: then we landed in an Hand, where were many gardens : there in a cave we found certaine Botijos of wine, which wee brought away with us, in recompence whereof, our general commanded to be set on shore woollen and linnen cloth, to the value thereof. From hence by foule weather wee were forced to seeke the Port of Saint John de Ullua. In our way thwart of Campeche 45°



we met with a Spaniard, a small ship, who was bound for Santo Domingo: he had in him a Spaniard called Augustin de villa nueva, who was the man that betrayed all the Noble men in the Indies, and caused them to be beheaded, wherefore he with two Friers fled to S. Domingo: them we tooke and brought with us into the Port of S. John de Ullua. Our general made great account of him, and used him like a Noble man: howbeit in the ende he was one of them that betrayed us. When wee had mored our ships, and landed, wee mounted the Ordinance that wee found there in the Ilande, and for our safeties kept watch and warde. The next day after wee discovered the Spanish fleete, whereof Lu^on a Spanyard was general: with him came a Spanyard called Don Martin Henriquez, whom the king of Hon Martin Spaine sent to be his Vice-roy of the Indies. He sent Henriquez. a Pinnesse with a flagge of truce unto our general, to knowe of what Countrey those Shippes were that rode there in the King of Spaines Port; who sayd, they were the Queene of Englands ships, which came in there for victuals for their money: wherefore if your general will come in here, he shall give me victuals and all other necessaries, and I will goe out on the one side of the Port, and he shall come in on the other side. The Spanyard returned for answere, that he was a Vice-roy, and had a thousand men, & therefore he would come in. Our general sayd, If he be a Vice-roy, I represent my Queenes person, & I am a Vice-roy as well as he: and if he have a thousand men, my powder and shot will take the better place. Then the Vice-roy after counsell among themselves, yeelded to our Generals demaund, swearing by his King and his Crowne, by his commission and authority that he had from his King, that hee would performe it, and thereupon pledges were given on both parts. Our general bearing a godly and Christian minde, voyde of fraude and deceit, judged the Spanyards to have done the like, delivered to them sixe gentlemen, not doubting to have received the like from [III. 490.]

them: but the faithlesse Spanyardes, in costly apparell gave of the basest of their company, as afterwardes it was well knowen. These things finished, proclamation was made on both sides, that on payne of death no occasion should be given, whereby any quarel should grow to the breach of the league, and then they peaceably entred the port, with great triumph on both sides.



The Spaniards presently brought a great Hulke, a ship of sixe hundred, and mored her by the side of the Minion, and they cut out ports in their other ships, planting their ordinance towards us, in the night they filled the Hulke with men, to lay the Minion aboord, as the sequel did shew, which made our General doubtful of their dealings: wherefore, for that he could speake the Spanish tongue, he sent Robert Barret aboord the Vice-roy, to knowe his meaning in those dealings, who willed him with his company to come in to him, whom he commanded presently to be set in the bilbowes, and forthwith a Cornet (for a watchword among the false Spaniards) was sounded for the enterprising of their pretended treason against our general, whom Augustine de villa nova sitting at dinner with him, should then presently have killed with a poynado which hee had privily in his sleeve, which was espyed and prevented by one John Chamberlayne, who tooke the poynado out of his sleeve. Our General hastily rose up, and commanded him to be put prisoner in the Stewards roome, & to be kept with two men. The faithlesse Spanyards, thinking all things to their desire had bene finished, suddenly sounded a Trumpet, and therewith three hundred Spaniards entred the Minion, whereat our General with a loude and fierce voyce called unto us, saying, God and Saint George, upon those traiterous villaines, and rescue the Minion, I trust in God the day shalbe ours : and with that the Mariners & souldiers leapt out of the Jesus of Lubeck into the Minion, and beat out the Spanyards, and with a shot out of her fiered the Spaniards Vice admirall, where the most part of 300. Spanyards were 45 2



spoyled, and blowen over boord with powder. Their Admirall also was on fire halfe an houre: we cut our cables, wound off our ships, and presently fought with them: they came upon us on every side, and continued the fight from ten of the clocke until it was night: they killed all our men that were on shore in the Hand, saving three, which by swimming got aboord the Jesus of 0« of those Lubeck. They sunke the Generals ship called the Angel,	was



and tooke the Swallow: the Spaniards Admirall had	^reof'



above threescore shot through her: many of his men were spoyled: foure other of their ships were sunke. Foure Spanish There were in that fleete, and that came from the shore su”ko-to rescue them, fifteene hundred: we slew of them five hundred and fourtie, as we were credibly informed by a note that came to Mexico. In this fight the Jesus of Lubeck had five shotte through her mayne Mast: her fore-mast was strooke in sunder under the hounds with a chayne shotte, and her hull was wonderfully pearced with shotte, therefore it was unpossible to bring her away. They set two of their owne Shippes on fire, intending therewith to have burnt the Jesus of Lubeck, which we prevented by cutting our cables in the halse, and winding off by our sternefast.



The Minion was forced to set saile and stand off from us, and come to an anker without shot of the Island. Our general couragiously cheered up his souldiers and gunners, and called to Samuel his page for a cup of Beere, who brought it him in a silver cup, and hee drinking to all men willed the gunners to stand by their Ordinance lustily like men. He had no sooner set the cup out of his hand, but a demy Culverin shot stroke away the cup and a Coopers plane that stoode by the maine mast, and ranne out on the other side of the ship: which nothing dismaid our general, for he ceased not to incourage us, saying, feare nothing, for God, who hath preserved me from this shot, will also deliver us from these traitours and villaines. Then Captaine Bland meaning to have turned out of the port, had his maine



453

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



mast stroke over boord with a chaine shot that came from the shore, wherefore he ankered, fired his ship, tooke his pinnesse with all his men, and came aboord the Jesus of Lubek to our general, who said unto him, that he thought he would not have runne away from him: he answered, that he was not minded to have run away from him, but his intent was to have turned up, and to have laid the weathermost ship of the Spanish fleete aboord, and fired his ship in hope therewith to have set on fire the Spanish fleete, hee said if he had done so he had done well. With this, night came on. Our general commanded the Minion, for safegard of her masts to be brought under the Jesus of Lubecks lee : he willed M. Francis Drake to come in with the Judith, and to lay the Minion aboord, to take in men and other things needefull, and to goe out, and so he did.



At night when the wind came off the shore, wee set sayle, and went out in despite of the Spanyards and their shot, where wee ankered, with two ankers under the Island, the wind being Northerly, which was wonderfull dangerous, and wee feared every houre to be driven with the lee shore. In the end when the wind came larger, we waied anker, and set saile, seeking the river of Panuco for water, whereof we had very little, and victuals were so scarce, that we were driven to eate hides, cats, rats, parrats, munkies, and dogges: wherefore our general was forced to divide his company into two parts, for there was a mutinie among them for want of victuals: and some said that they had rather be on the shore to shift for themselves amongst the enemies, then to sterve on ship-boord. He asked them who would go on shore, and who would tarry on ship-boord, those that would goe on shore, he willed to goe on foremast, and those that would tarrie, on baft mast: fourescore and sixteene of us were willing to depart. Our general gave unto every one of us sixe yards of Roane cloth, and money to them that demanded it. When we were landed, he came unto us, where friendly imbracing every one of



454



us, he was greatly grieved that he was forced to leave us behind him, he counselled us to serve God, and to love one another, and thus courteously he gave us a sorowfol farewell, and promised if God sent him safe home, he would do what he could, that so many of us as lived should by some means be brought into England, & so he did.



Since my returne into England I have heard that many misliked that he left us so behind him, and brought away Negroes: but the reason is this, for them he might have had victuals, or any other thing needfull, if by foule weather hee had bene driven upon the Islands, which for gold nor silver he could not have had.



And thus our general departed to his ship, and we remained on land, where for our safeties, fearing the wild Indians that were about us, we kept watch all night, and at Sunne rising wee marched on our way, three and three in a ranke, untill that we came into a fielde under a grove, where the Indians came upon us, asking us what people we were, and how we came there. Two of our company, namely Anthony Goddard and John Cornish, for that they could speake the Spanish tongue, went to them, and said wee were Englishmen, that never came in that countrey before, and that we had fought with the Spaniards, and for that we lacked victuals, our general set us on shore: they asked us whither we intended to goe, we said to Panuco. The Captaine of the Indians willed us to give unto them some of our clothes & shirts, which we did: then he bad us give them all, but we would not so doe, whereupon John Cornish was then slaine with an arrow, which an Indian boy that stoode by the Captaine shot at him, wherefore he stroke the boy on the necke with his bow, that he lay for dead, and willed us to follow him, who brought us into a great fielde, where we found fresh water: hee bad us sit downe about the pond and drinke, and he with his company would goe in the meane space to kill five or sixe Deere, and bring them 455

us. We taryed there till three of the clocke, but they came not: there one of our company whose name was John Cooke, with foure other departed from us into a grove to seeke reliefe, where presently they were taken by the Indians, and stript as naked as ever they were borne, and so returned to us.



Then we divided our selves into two parts, halfe to Anthony Goddard, and the rest to James Collier, and thus severally we sought for Panuco. Anthony Goddard with his company, bid us farewell, they passed a river, where the Indians robbed many of them of their clothes, and so passing on their way, came to a stony hill, where they stayed. James Collier with his company that day passed the same river, and were also robbed, and one of them slaine by chance: wee came that night unto the hill, where Anthony Goddard and his company rested, there we remained til morning, and then we marched altogether from thence, entring betweene two groves, where the Indians robbed us of all our clothes, and left us naked, they hurt many, and killed eight of us. Three dayes after we came to another river, there the Indians shewed us the way to Panuco, and so left us: we passed the river into the wildernes, where we made wreaths of greene grasse, which we wound about our bodies, to keepe us from the Sunne, and gnats of that Countrey. We travelled there seven dayes, and seven nights, before wee came to Panuco, feeding on nothing but roots, and Guiavos, a fruit like figs. At our comming to the river of Panuco two Spanish horsemen came over unto us in a Canowe: they asked us how long we had bene in the wildernesse, and where our general was, for they knewe us to be of the company that had fought with their countrimen: we told them seven dayes and seven nights, and for lacke of victuals our general set us on shore, & he was gone away with his ships. They returned to their Governour, who sent them with five Canowes to bring us all over, which done, they set us in aray, where a hundred horsemen with their lances, 456



came forceably upon us, but did not hurt us, they carried us prisoners to Panuco, where we remained one night. In the river of Panuco there is a fish like a calfe, the Spanyards call it a Mallatin, hee hath a stone in his head, which the Indians use for the disease of the Collicke, in the night he commeth on land, and eateth grasse. I have eaten of it, and it eateth not much unlike to bacon. From thence we were sent to Mexico, which is 90 leagues from Panuco. In our way thither, 20 leagues from the sea side, I did see white Crabs running up & downe the sands, I have eaten of them, and they be very good [III. 492.] meat. There groweth a fruit which the Spanyards call Avocottes, it is proportioned like an egge, and as blacke as a cole, having a stone in it, and it is an excellent good fruit. There also groweth a strange tree which they



call Magueis, it serveth them to many uses, below by A manifold use the root they make a hole, wherat they do take out of tfMagueis. it twise every day a certaine kind of licour, which they seeth in a great kettle, till the third part be consumed, & that it wax thick, it is as sweet as any hony, and they do eat it. Within 20. daies after that they have taken al the licour from it, it withereth, & they cut it down, & use it as we use our hempe here in England, which done, they convert it to many uses: of some part they make mantles, ropes, and threed: of the ends they make needles to sow their saddles, panneis, & other furniture for their horses: of the rest they make tyles to cover their houses, and they put it to many other purposes.



And thus we came to Mexico, which is seven or eight miles about, seated in a great fen, invironed with 4 hils, it hath but two wayes of entrance, and it is full of creeks, in the which in their Canowes they passe from place to place, & to the Islands there within. In the Indies ordinarily three times a yeere bee wonderfull earthquakes, which put the people in great feare and danger: during the time of two yeeres that I was in Mexico, I saw them sixe times: when they come they throw downe trees,



457



houses, and Churches. There is a citie 25. leagues from Mexico, called Tlaxcalla, which is inhabited with a hundred thousand Indians, they goe in white shirts, linnen breeches, and long mantles, and the women weare about them a garment much like unto a flannell petticote. The kings pallace was the first place wee were brought unto in Mexico, where without we were willed to sit downe. Much people, men, women, and children came wondring about us, many lamented our misery, & some of their clergy asked us if we were Christians, we said, we praised God, we were as good Christians as they: they asked how they might know that, we said, by our confessions. From thence we were carried in a Canow to a Tanners house, which standeth a little from the citie: the next morning two friers and two priests came thither to us, and willed us to blesse our selves, and say our prayers in the Latin tongue, that they might understand us, many of our company did so, whereupon they returned to the viceroy, and told him that we were good Christians, and that they liked us well, and then they brought us much reliefe, with clothes, our sicke men were sent to their Hospitals, where many were cured, and many died. From the Tanners house we were led to a gentlemans place, where upon paine of death we were charged to abide, and not to come into the citie, thither we had all things necessary brought us: on Sundayes and holy dayes much people came, and brought us great reliefe.



The viceroy practised to hang us, and caused a paire of new gallowes to be set up, to have executed us, wherunto the noblemen of that countrey would not consent, but prayed him to stay until the ship of advise brought newes from the king of Spaine, what should be done with us, for they said they could not find any thing by us, whereby they might lawfully put us to death.



The viceroy then commanded us to be sent to an Island there by, and he sent for the Bishop of Mexico, 4S8



who sent foure priests to the Island, to examine and confesse us, who said, that the viceroy would burne us, when wee were examined and confessed according to the lawes of the countrey. They returned to the Bishop, and told him that we were very good Christians. The Bishop certified the viceroy of our examinations and confessions, and said that wee were good Christians, therefore he would not meddle with us. Then the viceroy sent for our master, R. Barret, whom he kept prisoner in his pallace, untill the fleete was departed for Spayne. The rest of us he sent to a towne seven leagues from Mexico called Tescuco, to card wooll among the Indian slaves, which drudgery we disdained, and concluded to beat our masters, and so wee did: wherefore they sent to the viceroy, desiring him for Gods sake and our Ladies, to send for us, for they would not keepe us any longer, they said that we were devils and no men.



The viceroy sent for us, and imprisoned us in a house in Mexico, from thence he sent Anthony Goddard, & some other of our company with him into Spaine, with Lu?on, the General that tooke us: the rest of us staied in Mexico two yeres after, and then were sent prisoners into Spaine, with Don Juan de Velasco de Varre, admirall and general of the Spanish fleet, who caried with him in his ship, to be presented to the K. of Spaine, the anatomie of a giant, which was sent from China to Mexico, to the viceroy Don Martin Henriquez, to bee sent to the king of Spaine for a great wonder. It did appere by the anatomie, that he was of a monstrous size, the skull of his head was neere as bigge as halfe a bushel, his necke-bones, shoulder-plates, arme-bones, and all other lineaments of his other partes, were huge and monstrous to behold, the shanke of his legge from the ankle to the knee was as long as from any mans ankle up to his wast, and of bignesse accordingly.



At this time, and in this ship, were also sent to be presented to the king of Spaine, two chestes full of earth 459

with ginger growing in them, which were also sent from China, to be sent to the king of Spaine. The ginger runneth in the ground like to liccoras, the blades grow out of it in length and proportion like unto the blades of wild garlicke, which they cut every fifteene dayes, they use to water them twise a day, as we doe our herbes here in England, they put the blades in their pottage, and use them in their other meates, whose excellent savour and tast is very delightfull, and procureth a good appetite.



When we were shipped in the Port of S. John de Ullua, the general called our master Robert Barret and us with him into his cabbin, & asked us if wee would fight against Englishmen if we met them at the sea, we said that we would not fight against our Crowne, but if we met with any other, we would do what we were able. He said if we had said otherwise he would not have beleeved us, and for that we should be the better used, and have allowance as other men had: and he gave a charge to every one of us, according unto our knowledge, Robert Barret was placed with the pilote, I was put in the gunners roome, William Cawse with the boat-swaine, John Beare with the quarter-masters, Edward Rider, & Geffrey Giles, with the ordinary mariners, Richard the masters boy attended on him and the pilote: shortly after we departed from the port of S. John de Ullua with all the fleete of Spaine, for the port called Havana: wee were 26. dayes sayling thither. There wee came in, ankered, tooke in fresh water, and stayed 16. dayes for the fleete of Nombre de Dios, which is the fleet that brings the treasure from Peru.



The general of that fleet was called Diego Flores de Valdes. After his comming, when he had watred his ships, both the fleetes joyned in one, and Don Juan de Velasco de Varre was the first fifteen daies general of both the fleets, who turning through the chanell of Bahama, his pilote had like to have cast away all the fleet upon the Cape called Cannaveral, which was prevented by me John Hortop, & our master Robert Barret: for I 460



being in the second watch escried land, and called to Robert Barret, bidding him looke over boord, for I saw land under the lee-bow of the ship: he called to the boat-swaine, & bid him let flie the fore saile sheat, and lay the helm upon the lee, and cast the ship about. When we were cast about, we were but in seven fathome water: we shot off a piece, giving advice to the fleet to cast about, and so they did. For this we were beloved o the general, and all the fleet. The general was in a great rage, and swore by the king, that he would hang his pilote: for he said, that twise before he had almost cast away the Admirall. When it was day, he commanded a piece to be shot ofF, to call to councill: the other Admirall in his ship came up to him, and asked what the matter was, he said, that his pilote had cast away his ship and all the fleet, had it not bene for two of the Englishmen, and therefore he would hang him. The other Admirall with many faire words perswaded him to the contrary.



When we came in the height of Bermuda, we dis- A sea-monster covered a monster in the sea, who shewed himselfe three ™ ttesliafe times unto us from the middle upwards, in which parts °^a man' hee was proportioned like a man, of the complection of a Mulato, or tawny Indian. The general did commaund one of his clearks to put it in writing, and hee certified the King and his Nobles thereof. Presently after this, for the space of sixteene dayes we had wonderful foule weather, and then God sent us a faire wind, untill such time as we discovered the Hand called Faial.



On S. James day we made rackets, wheeles, and other fire-workes, to make pastime that night, as it is the order of the Spanyards. When we came neere the land, our master R. Barret conferred with us, to take the pinnesse one night, when we came on the Hand called Ter? era, to free our selves from the danger and bondage that we were going into, whereunto we agreed: none had any pinnesse asterne then but our ship, which gave great courage to our enterprise: we prepared a bagge of bread, and a Botijo of water, which would have served us nine dayes, and 461



provided our selves to goe: our Master borrowed a small compasse of the Master gunner of the ship, who lent it him, but suspected his intent, and closely made the general privy to it, who for a time dissembled the matter. In the ende seeing our pretense, he called R. Barret, commanding his head to bee put in the stocks, and a great payre of yron bolts on his legs, & the rest of us to be set in the stocks by the legs. Then he willed a peece to be shot off, and hee sent the pinnesse for the other Admirall, and all the captaines, masters and pilots of both fleetes to come aboord of him. He commanded the mayne-yard to be strooke downe, and to put 2. pullies, on every yard-arme one; the hangman was called, and we were willed to confesse our selves, for he swore by the king that he would hang us.



When the other Admiral, and the rest were come aboord, he called them into his counsel-chamber, and told them that he would hang the master of the Englishmen, and all his company. The Admirall, whose name was Diego Flores de Valdes, asked him wherefore: he sayd, that we had determined to rise in the night with the pinnesse, and with a ball of fireworke to set the ship on fire, and goe our wayes: therefore, sayd he, I will have you the Captaines, Masters, and Pilotes, to set your hands unto that, for I sweare by the king that I will hang them, [III. 494.] Diego Flores de Valdes answered, I nor the Captaines, Masters, and Pilotes wil not set our hands to that, for hee said, if he had bin prisoner as we were, he would have done the like himselfe. He counselled him to keepe us fast in prison, till he came into Spaine, & then send us to the Contratation house in Sivil, where, if we had deserved death the law would passe on us, for hee would not have it said that in such a fleet as that was, sixe men and a boy should take the pinnesse, and goe away, and so he returned to his ship againe.



When he was gone, the general came to the maine mast to us, and swore by the king, that we should not come out of the stocks til we came into Spaine: within 462



16 dayes after we came over the bar of S. Lucar, and came up to the Hurcados, then he put us into a pinnesse in the stocks, and sent us prisoners to the Contratation house in Sivill. From thence after one yere we brake prison, on S. Stevens day at night, 7. of our company escaped, Robert Barret, I Job Hortop, John Emerie, Humphrey Roberts, and John Gilbert were taken, and brought backe to the contratation house, where we remained in the stocks till twelfe tide was past. Then our keeper put up a petition to the Judge of the contratation house, that we might be sent to the great prison house in Sivill, for that we broke prison, whereupon we were presently led thither, where we remained one moneth, and then from thence, to the castell of the Inquisition house in Triana, where wee continued one yere: which expired, they brought us out in procession, every one of us having a candle in his hand, and the coate with S. Andrewes crosse on our backs: they brought us up on an high scaffold, that was set up in the place of S. Francis, which is in the chiefe street of Sivill: there they set us downe upon benches, every one in his degree, and against us on another scaffold sate all the Judges, and the Clergy on their benches: the people wondered, and gazed on us, some pittying our cases, other said, burne those heretikes. When we had sit there two houres, we had a sermon made to us : after which one called Bresinia, secretarie to the Inquisition, went up into the pulpit with the processe, and called Robert Barret and John Gilbert, whom two familiars of Robert Barret the Inquisition brought from the scaffold before the Judges, where the secretarie read the sentence, which	'



was that they should be burnt, and so they returned to the scaffold, and were burnt.



Then I Job Hortop, and John Bone were called, and Job Hortop brought to the place, as before, where we heard our hls cmdm-sentence, which was, that we should go to the Games, and there row at the oares ende ten yeeres, and then to be brought backe to the Inquisition house, to have the coate with S. Andrewes crosse put on our backs, and



463



from thence to goe to the everlasting prison remedilesse, and so we were returned from the scaffold from whence we came. Thomas Marks, & Thomas Ellis were called, and had sentence to serve in the Galleys eight yeeres, and Humphrey Roberts, and John Emery to serve five yeeres, & so were returned to the benches on the scaffold, where we sate till foure of clocke in the afternoone. Then we were led againe to the Inquisition house, from whence we were brought. The next day in the morning Bresinia the treasurer came thither to us, and delivered to every one of us his sentence in writing. I with the rest were sent to the Gallies, where we were chained foure and foure together: every mans daily allowance was 26. ounces of course blacke bisket and water, our clothing for the whole yeere two shirts, two paire of breeches of course canvas, a red coat of course cloth, soone on, and soone off, and a gowne of haire with a friers hood: our lodging was on the bare boords, and banks of the Gallies, our heads and beards were shaven every month, hunger, thirst, cold, and stripes we lacked none, til our several times expired. And after the time of 12. yeeres, for I served two yeeres above my sentence, I was sent backe to the Inquisition house in Sivill, and there having put on the coat with S. Andrewes crosse, I was sent to the everlasting prison remedilesse, where I wore the coat 4. yeres, & then upon great suit, I had it taken off for 50 duckets, which Hernando de Soria treasurer of the kings mint lent me, whom I served for it as a drudge 7. yeres, and until the moneth 1590. of October last, 1590, and then I came from Sivill to



S. Lucar, where I made meanes to come away in a flie-boat, that was laden with wines and salt, which were Flemings goods, the king of Spaines subjects, dwelling in Sivil, maried to Spanish women, and sworne to their king. In this moneth of October last, departing from S. Lucar, at sea, off the southermost Cape, we met an English ship, called the Galeon Dudley, who took the Flemming, & me out of him, & brought me to Ports-464



1590. mouth, where they set me on land, the 2. day of December last past, 1590. From thence I was sent by 1590.



M. Muns the lieutenant of Portsmouth, with letters to the R. honorable the Earle of Sussex, who commanded his secretary to take my name and examination, how long I had bene out of England, and with whom I went, which he did. And on Christmas even I took my leave of his honor, and came to Redriffe.

Thus having truely set downe unto you my travels, misery and dangers, endured the space of 23. yeeres, I ende.
