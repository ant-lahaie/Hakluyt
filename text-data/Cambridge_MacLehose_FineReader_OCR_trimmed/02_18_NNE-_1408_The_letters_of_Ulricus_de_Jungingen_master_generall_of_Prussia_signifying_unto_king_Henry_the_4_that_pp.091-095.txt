Nto your highnes pleasure at all assaies humbly recommending my voluntarie service &c. Most renowmed king, mighty prince, and gracious lord, we received of late with great reverence as it becommeth us, by our welbeloved Arnold de Dassel the bearer of these presents,

Here relation is had unto ye king of the Romans.



THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



John Crolow citizen of the same citie, for our parte. And for our more perfect knowlege in this behalfe, our sayd commissioners made relation unto us and unto our whole counsell, that associating unto themselves our messengers of Livonia, namely, Tidman Myeul, and John Epensheid, together with your foresaid ambassa-dours and messengers, they there finally appoynted and concluded, of and about the above mentioned summes of money due on both partes, of the which mention is made in your letters aforesayd. With this special! proviso, that in like manner satisfaction be made in all points, both unto other of our damnified subjects of Prussia, namely such whose goods or the true value thereof have bene finally adjudged by the judges or professors of our lawes, and unto such who having brought their articles of complaints unto the audience of the most dread and mighty prince and lorde, our lord Rupertus king of the Romans alwayes most soveraigne, were in conclusion to have the estimations of their goods to be adjudged by the sentence of the sayd lord, with the advise of two of his counsellers, and also unto other of our subjects who have brought in sufficient proofe of damages unjustly inflicted upon them by your subjects, over and besides the premisses. So that in like maner satisfaction be made unto the common societie of the Hans marchants : and by the arbitrament set downe in the conferences had at Marien-burgh, of the which it was above provided and enacted on their behalfe, namely if they will rest contented with our subjects in the courses and meanes then concluded. If not, we intend not at all to adhere unto them in this behalfe. Afterward our messengers aforesayd, both they of Prussia and of Livonia demanded convenient, just, and speedy satisfaction, with the payment of all and singular the summes above mentioned, due unto both parts (so farre foorth as equity and reason would yeeld unto, for the recompense of the parties injuried and endamaged on both sides) to be made within one whole



yere accompting from the feast of Easter now last expired unto the very same feast next to come in the yere immediatly following, & that in three several termes of payment, by three portions of the said summes equally to be divided, at the towne of Bruges in Flanders as being a place indifferent for all parties, in maner and forme as it was before at Marienburgh required and stoode upon: namely that reformation, reparation, and amendement of all unjust attempts committed on both parts ought to bee performed within one yere. Howbeit contrariwise your ambassadors aforesayd decreed that the sayd satisfaction should be performed unto the parties injuried of both parts within three yeeres, beginning to accompt from the feast of Easter last past. And when your ambassadours were not contented with the maner of satisfaction set downe by our men, nor our commissioners were willing in any sort to consent unto that course which was thought convenient by your ambassadors, the honorable messengers of the sea-townes of the Hans being there at that time present, made a motion that the foresayd satisfaction might be performed within two yeeres and an halfe, accompting from the feast of Easter last past, often before mentioned: yet under a certaine protestation, namely if both parties should agree unto [I. 179.] that forme of satisfaction, and if they should thinke good finally and conclusively to yeeld their consent unto it. Which kind of satisfaction also conceived by the messengers, your sayd ambassadours without giving notice therof unto your royall Majestie, refused finally to approve; being rather desirous to make a true & faithfull report of the sayd forme of satisfaction last above mentioned unto your kingly highnesse, and that in such sorte, that (as they hoped) efFectuall satisfaction and payment of all and singuler the summes due and to bee due on both partes should more conveniently and speedily bee performed. Whereupon we might be put in good hope, that more speedy and convenient



appointments of termes, for the sayd satisfaction friendly on both parts to be performed in, would have proceeded from your bountifull and gracious clemencie. And in very deede (most mighty prince) albeit it was never the meaning of our foresayd predecessor, so far foorth as these affayres concerned him, to protract and delay the execution of the sayd busines so many and such long distances of time, and that for divers respects, both because restitution unto the parties robbed consisted herein, and also because the sayd restitutions and satisfactions are to be made unto poore people, widowes, orphanes, and other miserable creatures, diversly and miserably slaine and oppressed: notwithstanding we being moved with hearty & fervent zeale and speciali affection unto your royall crowne of England, and having due regard and consideration of your most excellent Majestie, upon the advise of our honourable brethren our counsellers, doe thankfully receive, & by the tenour of these presents totally ratifie and approve such satisfactions of the foresayd summes howsoever due unto our subjects both Prussians and Livonians, in friendly sorte to be performed at such times and seasons limited and prefixed by your highnes as are expressed in your majesties letters, and also of other summes which within one yeare immediately ensuing after the feast of Easter last past, by sufficient proofes to be made on their part before your chancelour at your citie of London shall be found due unto them. Conditionally that without inconvenience of delay and impediment they be performed as they ought to be, according to the premisses. In like maner also we our selves within the termes of payment above mentioned will procure satisfaction to be without fayle perfourmed unto your subjects endamaged, with the summe of 766. nobles, being in regard of their losses, of the which they have given up sufficient informations, due unto them: and with other like summes also which are by sufficient proofes, within the yeare



1408. aforesayd, and in maner and forme prescribed to be exhibited before our treasurer at our citie of Dantzik.



The almighty vouchsafe prosperously and long time to preserve your majesties royal person. Given at Sept. 27., our castle of Marienburgh the 27. of September, in I+Â°8, the yeare of our Lord 1408.



Fr. Ulricus de Jungingen master general of the order of the Dutch knights of S. Maries hospital of Jerusalem.
