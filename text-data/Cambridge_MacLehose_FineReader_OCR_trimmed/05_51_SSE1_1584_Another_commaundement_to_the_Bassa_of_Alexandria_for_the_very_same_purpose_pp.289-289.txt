A commandement to the Bassa of Alexandria.



THe Embassadour for the Queenes most excellent



Majesty of England by supplication certified us, how that notwithstanding our privilege granted them to make Consuls in al parts of our dominions to governe their nation according to their owne custome & law, to defend them against all wrongs and injuries whatsoever : yet that the French Consuli affirming to thee that art Bassa, that they were under his banner, and that he should governe them, and oversee their businesse, and having got a new privilege, mentioning therein the English men to be under his banner, did by all meanes molest 8c trouble them, insomuch that their Consuli oppressed with many injuries fled away, and that thou which art Beglerbie didst maintaine the French Consul herein ; whereupon the Embassadour required our commandement, that they might have justice for these injuries : wherefore we command thee that having received this our commandement, you examine diligently that his privilege, and send the copie thereof hither, and if it be found that the French Consuli Vento hath by subtiltie got the aforesaid privilege written, that you then see him punished, and suffer not hereafter the French or Venetian Consuls to intermeddle with their businesse. Obey this our commaundement, and give credite to the seale.
