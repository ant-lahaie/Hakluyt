Another testimony taken out of the 60 chapter of the foresayd history of Ferdinando Columbus, concerning the offer that Bartholomew Colombus made to king Henry the seventh on the behalfe of his brother Christopher.



Ornato adunque 1’ Ammiraglio dallo scoprimento di Cuba & di Giamaica, trond nella Spagnuola Bartolomeo Colon suo fratello, quello, che era gia andato a trattare accordo col Re d’ Inghilterra sopra lo scoprimento delle Indie, come di sopra habiam detto. Questo poi,



ritornando sene verso Castiglia con capitoli conceduti, haveva inteso a Parigi dal re Carlo di Francia 1’ Ammiraglio suo fratello haver gia scoperte 1’ Indie : per che gli sovenne per poter far il Viaggio di cento scudi. Et, Avenga che per cotal nuova egli si fosse molto affrettato, per arrivar 1’ Ammiraglio in Spagna, quando non dimeno giunse a Siviglia, egli era gia tornato alle Indie co’ 17 navigii. Perche, per asseguir quanto ei gli havea lasciato, di subito al principio dell’ anno del 1494 sen’ ando a i Re Catholici, menando seco Don Diego Colon, mio fratello, & me ancora, accioche servissimo di paggi al serenissimo principe Don Giovanni, il qual viva in gloria, si come havea commandato la Catholica Reina donna Isabella, che alhora era in Vagliadolid. Tosto adunque che noi giungemmo, i Re chiamarono Don Bartolomeo, & mandaronlo alia Spagnuola contre navi, &c.



The same in English.



CHristopher Columbus the Admirall being returned from the discovery of Cuba and Jamayca, found in Hispaniola his brother Bartholomew Columbus, who before had beene sent to intreat of an agreement with the king of England for the discovery of the Indies, as we 139



[III. 4.} have sayd before. This Bartholomew therefore returning unto Castile, with the capitulations granted by the king of England to his brother, understood at Paris by Charles the king of France, that the Admirall his brother had already performed that discovery: whereupon the French king gave unto the sayd Bartholomew an hundred French crownes to beare his charges into Spaine. And albeit he made great haste upon this good newes to meet with the Admirall in Spaine, yet at his comming to Sivil his brother was already returned to the Indies with seventeene saile of shipps. Wherefore to fulfill that which he had left him in charge in the beginning of the yeere 1494 he repaired to the Catholike princes, taking with him Diego Colon my brother and me also, which were to be preferred as Pages to the most excellent Prince Don John, who now is with God, according to the commandement of the Catholike Queene Lady Isabell, which was then in Validolid. Assoone therefore as we came to the Court, the princes called for Don Bartholomew, and sent him to Hispaniola with three ships, &c.
