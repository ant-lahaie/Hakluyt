A testimonie of the sending of Sighelmus Bishop of Shirburne, by King Alphred, unto Saint Thomas of India in the yeare of our Lord 883, recorded by William of Malmesburie, in his second booke and fourth Chapter de gestis regum Anglorum.



Leemosynis intentus privilegia ecclesiarum, sicut pater statuerat, roboravit; & trans mare Romam, & ad sanctum Thomam in Indiam multa munera misit. Legatus in hoc missus Sighelmus Shirburnensis Episcopus cum magna prosperitate, quod quivis hoc seculo miretur, Indiam pene-



travit; inde rediens exoticos splendores gemmarum, & liquores aromatum, quorum illa humus ferax est, reportavit.



The same in English.



King Alphred being addicted to giving of almes, confirmed the privileges of Churches as his father had determined; and sent also many giftes beyond the seas unto Rome, and unto S. Thomas of India. His messenger in this businesse was Sighelmus bishop of Schir-burne; who with great prosperitie (which is a matter to be wondered at in this our age) travailed thorough India, and returning home brought with him many strange and precious unions and costly spyces, such as that countrey plentifully yeeldeth.
