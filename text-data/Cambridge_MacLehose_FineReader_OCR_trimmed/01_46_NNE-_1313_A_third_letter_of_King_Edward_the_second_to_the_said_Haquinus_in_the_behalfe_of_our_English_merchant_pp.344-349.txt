A third letter of King Edward the second, to Haquinus King of Norway in the behalfe of certaine English Marchants.



AAgnifico Principi Domino Haquino Dei gratia Regi IVI Norwegiae illustri, amico suo charissimo, Edwardus eadem Dei gratia Rex Angliae, dominus Hyberniae, & dux Aquitaniae, salutem cum dilectione sincera. Pro mercatoribus nostris Lennae, & partium vicinarum, quos Ballivus & Officiarii vestri civitatis vestrae Bergen dudum 344



. . . 13131 ceperunt, & stricto carceri manciparunt, quorum multi ut jam intelleximus, propter alimentorum subtractionem & duritiam, ac asperitatem carceris perierunt, ut ipsorum & bonorum suorum deliberationem praecipere curaretis, vestrae serenitati Regiae nostras nuper transmisimus literas speciales. Sed vos, retentis adhuc in carcere nostris mercatoribus sicut prius, nobis per literas vestras quas audivimus & intelleximus diligenter, inter caetera rescripsistis, quod quidam mercatores de regno vestro de injuriis, violentiis & arrestationibus, quibus in regno nostro his diebus sunt, ut asserunt, contra justitiam aggravati, multipliciter conqueruntur, adjiciendo in vestris literis memoratis, quod quidam iniquitatis filii in villa Lennae, ad piscandum ut dicebant halecia venientes, quendam militem Ballivum vestrum, in Vikia una cum decem aliis subditis vestris, in vestris & regni vestri negotiis existentibus crudeliter occiderunt. Super quibus mens nostra gravatur quamplurimum & turbatur, praesertim quum nunquam nostrae fuerit voluntatis, quod injuriae, violentiae, seu arrestationes aliquae mercatoribus, vel aliis de regno vestro per aliquos de regno & potestate nostris fierent indebite vel injuste: nec adhuc intelligere possumus, quod mercatoribus vestris per aliquem vel aliquos de subditis nostris huc usque aliter factum fuerit: Scientes pro certo quod si nobis per inquisitiones legitimas constare poterit hujusmodi gravamina subditis vestris infra regnum nostrum illata fuisse, nos sufficientes emendas, & satisfactiones debitas super illis, celerisque justitiae complementum fieri faciemus. Et insuper si malefactores praedicti, qui praefatum militem, & alios secum existentes, ut praemittitur, occiderunt, de regno, seu potestate nostra sint, vel infra idem regnum vel potestatem poterunt inveniri, de ipsis judicium & justitiam fieri praecipiemus, secundum Leges & consuetudines regni nostri. Et quia inter nos & vos, nostrosque & vestros subditos hinc inde foveri desideramus mutuam concordiam & amorem; ita quod mercatores nostri & vestri mercandisas suas in nostris &

Antiquitas vestris regnis & dominiis libere, & absque impedimento commerctt in- vajeant exercere, prout temporibus progenitorum nosy NOrwe- trorum fieri consuevit, & ex dictarum Iiterarum vestrarum gian. serie collegimus evidenter vos promptos esse similiter, & paratos ad omnia & singula, quae pro vobis & vestris subditis super discordiis, contentionibus, aut gravaminibus inter nostros & vestros subditos qualitercunque suscitatis pro bono pacis & justitiae fuerint aequanimiter facienda: Nos consimilia pro nobis & nostris, quantum ad nos & ad ipsos attinet, illius amore, qui pacis author fore dinoscitur, & pro quiete & commodo populi utriusque regnorum nostrorum, quatenus jus & ratio dictitaverint, promittimus nos facturos: Vestram amicitiam requirentes obnixius & rogantes, quatenus mercatores nostros praedictos, qui adhuc superstites relinquuntur, quos etiam tempore, quo dicta felonia committi dicebatur, interclusos tenebat custodia carceralis, jubere velitis nostri contemplatione, zeloque justitiae ab hujusmodi custodia liberari, bona ab ipsis capta eis prout justum fuerit restitui faciendo. Et ut deliberatio mercatorum nostrorum praedictorum, & bonorum suorum ed facilius concedatur, placeat vobis cum diligentia debita ponderare, quod Galfridus Drewe, & quidam alii mercatores nostri de Lenne, quibusdam mercatoribus de regno vestro occasione ejusdem gravaminis ipsis mercatoribus vestris, [I. 141.] ad sectam Tidemanni Lippe infra regnum nostrum, ut dicebatur, illati, centum libras sterlingorum persolverunt, sicut in quodam scripto indentato inter Ingelramum Lende de Thorenden, & quosdam alios mercatores vestros ex parte una, & praefatum Galfridum, & quosdam alios de regno nostro similiter ex altera confecto, vidimus contineri. Si qui vero de subditis vestris de aliquibus subditis nostris, de aliqua injuria ipsis facta querelas in curia nostra deponere voluerint, & prosequi cum effectu, ipsorum subditorum vestrorum petitiones admitti, & eis super querelis hujusmodi plenam & celerem justitiam fieri faciemus. Ita quod iidem subditi vestri exinde reputare debebunt merito se contentos.



346



Et interim de excessibus & gravaminibus subditis vestris infra regnum nostrum qualitercunque illatis inquiri faciemus cum diligentia veritatem. Vestrae igitur voluntatis beneplacitum in praemissis nobis rescribere velitis per praesentium portitorem. Datae apud Westminster tertio die Aprilis.

TO the mightie Prince king Haquinus, by the grace of God the famous king of Norway, his most deare friend Edward by the same grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, Duke of Aquitaine, greeting and sincere love. We sent of late unto your royall majestie our special letters, for the behalfe of our late marchants of Lenne, and of the coast adjoyning (whome your baily and officers of the citie of Bergen lately apprehended, committing them to close prison, many of whome, as we understand, are, for want of due nourishment, and by reason of the extremitie & loath-somnesse of the prison, quite perished) that you would cause them and their goods to bee released. Howbeit, you reteining as yet our marchants in durance as before, in your letters, which we have diligently heard, and throughly understood, have, amongst other matters, returned this answere unto us: that certaine marchants of your kingdome doe make sundrie complaints of injuries, violences and arrests, whereby they have lately (as themselves avouch) contrary to justice bene aggrieved and oppressed in our dominions : adding moreover in your sayde letters, that certaine sonnes of iniquitie of the towne of Lenne, comming, as they saide, to fish for herrings, cruelly murthered a certaine Knight, who was in times past your bayliffe of Vikia, together with ten others of your subjects, being imployed about the affaires of your kingdome. In consideration whereof our minde is exceedingly and above measure grieved and troubled, especially sithence it was never any part of our intent, that any injuries, violences, or arrests

should unjustly be inflicted upon any marchants, or any others of your realme by any of our kingdomes: neither can we as yet have any intelligence, that any such hard measure hath bene offered unto any of your marchants, by any one or moe of our subjects: giving you for a certaintie to understand, that if upon lawfull inquisition we shalbe advertised of any such grievances, which have bene offered unto your subjects within our realme, we will cause speedie justice to be administred, and sufficient recompence, and due satisfaction to be made in regarde thereof. And moreover, if the saide malefactors, which, as it is aforesaid, slewe the forenamed Knight, and others of his companie, either be appertaining unto our kingdome and dominion, or may at any time be found within our saide kingdome or dominion, we will command justice and judgement to be executed upon them, according to the lawes and customes of our realme. And forasmuch as our desire is, that mutuall concord and amitie should be mainteined and cherished between your and our subjects on both parts: so that our and your marchants may, in both our Realmes and dominions, freely and without impediment exercise their traffique, as in the times of our progenitors it hath bene accustomed: Whereas also we evidently gathered out of the contents of your letter, that you are in like sort readie and willing to put all things in practise, which are by you and your subjects (for the taking away of discords, contentions, and molestations howsoever occasioned, and sprung up betweene your and our subjects) lovingly to be performed: we also doe promise for our selves, and our subjects, so much as in us and them lieth, for his sake who is knowen to be the author of peace, and for the benefite & tranquilitie of both our Realmes (as justice and reason shall move us) to doe the like. Desiring and earnestly requesting at your hands, that of your love and friendship, having regard of us, and consideration of justice, you would commaund that our foresaide

marchants, who as yet remaine alive, and who also at the time of the saide felonie committed, were shut up in close prison, be delivered out of the saide thraldome, causing their goods which have bene taken from them, to bee, according unto justice, restored to them again. And that the deliverie of our foresaide marchants and goods, may be the more easily yeelded unto, may it please you with diligent observation to consider, that Gefferey Drew, and certaine other of our marchants of Lenne, upon occasion of the greivances offered unto your marchants within our Realme, (as the report goeth) at the suite of Tidman Lippe, paide unto the same your marchants an hundreth pound sterling : even as in a certain Indenture made betweene [I. 142.] Ingelram Lende of Thorenden, and some other of your marchants on the one part, and betweene the foresaide Geffrey, and certaine of our marchants on the other part, wee sawe conteined. Moreover, if any of your subjects be minded to exhibite, and effectually to prosecute their complaints in our Court, concerning any of our subjects, or of any injury done unto them, we will cause the petitions of those your subjects to be admitted, and also full and speedie justice to be administred, upon any such like complaints of theirs. Insomuch, that those your subjects shal thinke themselves right well and sufficiently contented therewithal!. And in the meane space we will cause diligent inquisition of the trueth to be made, of all excesses and grievances howsoever offered unto your subjects within our dominions. May it please you therfore, by the bearer of these presents, to returne an answere unto us, what you are determined to doe in the premisses.



Given at Westminster, the third day of April.
