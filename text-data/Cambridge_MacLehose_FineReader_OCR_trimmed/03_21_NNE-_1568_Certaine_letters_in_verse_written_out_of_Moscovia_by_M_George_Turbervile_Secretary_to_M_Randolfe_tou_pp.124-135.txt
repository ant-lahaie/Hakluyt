Certaine letters in verse, written by Master George Turbervile out of Moscovia, which went as Secretarie thither with Master Tho. Randolph, her Majesties Ambassadour to the Emperour 1568, to certeine friends of his in London, describing the maners of the Countrey and people.



To his especiall friend Master Edward Dancie.



MY Dancie deare, when I recount within my brest, My London friends, and wonted mates, and thee above the rest:



I feele a thousand fits of deepe and deadly woe, To thinke that I from land to sea, from blisse to bale did go.



I left my native soile, full like a retchlesse man, And unacquainted of the coast, among the Russes ran:



A people passing rude, to vices vile inclinde,



Folke fit to be of Bacchus traine, so quaffing is their kinde.



Drinke is their whole desire, the pot is all their pride, The sobrest head doth once a day stand needfull of a guide.



If he to banket bid his friends, he will not shrinke On them at dinner to bestow a douzen kindes of drinke:



124



Such licour as they have, and as the countrey gives, But chiefly two, one called Kvas, whereby the Mousike lives.



Small ware and waterlike, but somewhat tart in taste, The rest is Mead of honie made, wherewith their lips they baste.



And if he goe unto his neighbour as a guest, He cares for title meate, if so his drinke be of the best. No wonder though they use such vile and beastly trade, Sith with the hatchet and the hand, their chiefest gods be made.



Their Idoles have their hearts, on God they never call, Unlesse it be (Nichola Bough) that hangs against the wall.



The house that hath no god, or painted Saint within, Is not to be resorted to, that roofe is full of sinne. Besides their private gods, in open places stand Their crosses unto which they crooche, and blesse themselves with hand.



Devoutly downe they ducke, with forehead to the ground,



Was never more deceit in ragges, and greasie garments found.



Almost the meanest man in all the countrey rides,



The woman eke, against our use, her trotting horse bestrides.	'



In sundry colours they both men and women goe, In buskins all, that money have on buskins to bestoe. Ech woman hanging hath a ring within her eare, Which all of ancient use, and some of very pride doe



[I- 385J



weare.



Their gate is very brave, their countenance wise and



sadde,



And yet they follow fleshly lustes, their trade of living badde.



It is no shame at all accompted to defile



Anothers bedde, they make no care their follies to concile,



i25



Is not the meanest man in all the land but hee,



To buy her painted colours doeth allow his wife a fee, Wherewith she deckes her selfe, and dies her tawnie skinne,



She pranks and paints her smoakie face, both brow, lip, cheeke, & chinne.



Yea those that honest are, if any such there bee



Within the land, doe use the like: a man may plainely see



Upon some womens cheekes the painting how it lies,



In plaister sort, for that too thicke her face the harlot dies.



But such as skilfull are, and cunning Dames indeede,



By dayly practise doe it well, yea sure they doe ex-ceede.



They lay their colours so, as he that is full wise, May easly be deceiv’d therein, if he doe trust his eyes.



I not a little muse, what madnesse makes them paint



Their faces, waying how they keepe the stoove by meere constraint.



For seidome when, unlesse on Church or marriage day A man shall see the Dames abroade, that are of best aray.



The Russie meanes to reape the profit of her pride,



And so he mewes her to be sure, she lye by no mans side.



Thus much, friend Dancie, I did meane to write to thee,



To let thee weete in Russia land, what men and women bee.



Hereafter I perhaps of other things will write



To thee, and other of my friends, which I shall see with sight:



And other stuffe besides, which true report shall tell, Meane while I ende my loving lines, and bid thee now farewell.



126



IF I should now forget, or not remember thee, Thou Spencer might’st a foule rebuke, and shame impute to mee.



For I to open shew did love thee passing well,



And thou wert he at parture, whome I loathde to bid farewell.



And as I went thy friend, so I continue still,



No better proofe thou canst then this desire of true good will.



I doe remember well when needes I should away,



And that the Poste would licence us, no longer time to stay :



Thou wrongst me by the fist, and holding fast my hand,



Didst crave of me to send thee newes, and how I liked the land.



It is a sandie soile, no very fruitfull vaine,	[I. 38&]



More waste and wooddie grounds there are, then closes fit for graine.



Yet graine there growing is, which they untimely take,



And cut or eare the corne be ripe, they mowe it on a stacke.



And laying sheafe by sheafe, their harvest so they dry,



They make the greater haste, for feare the frost the corne destroy.



For in the winter time, so glarie is the ground,



As neither grasse, nor other graine, in pastures may be found.



In coms the cattell then, the sheepe, the colt, the cowe,



Fast by his bed the Mowsike then a lodging doth allowe,



Whom he with fodder feeds, and holds as deere as life :



And thus they weare the winter with the Mowsike and his wife.



127



Seven months the Winter dures, the glare it is so great, As it is May before' he turne, his ground to sowe his wheate.



The bodies eke that die unburied lie they then,



Laid up in coffins made of firre, as well the poorest men,



As those of greater state : the cause is lightly found, For that in Winter time, they cannot come to breake the ground.



And wood so plenteous is, quite throughout all the land,



As rich, and poore, at time of death assurd of coffins stand.



Perhaps thou musest much, how this may stand with reason,



That bodies dead can uncorrupt abide so long a season. Take this for certaine trothe, as soone as heate is gone, The force of colde the body binds as hard as any stone,



Without offence at all to any living thing:



And so they lye in perfect state, till next returne of Spring.



Their beasts be like to ours, as farre as I can see



For shape, and shewe, but somewhat lesse of bulke, and bone they be.



Of watrish taste, the flesh not firme, like English beefe,



And yet it serv’s them very well, and is a good releefe :



Their sheepe are very small, sharpe singled, handfull long,



Great store of fowle on sea and land, the moorish reedes among.



The greatnes of the store doeth make the prices lesse, Besides in all the land they know not how good meate to dresse.



They use neither broach nor spit, but when the stove they heate,

GEORGE TURBERVILE’S LETTERS a.d. .	.	J 5^8.



They put their victuals in a pan, and so they bake their meate.



No pewter to be had, no dishes but of wood,



No use of trenchers, cups cut out of birche are very good.



They use but wooden spoones, which hanging in a case



Eache Mowsike at his girdle ties, and thinkes it no disgrace.



With whitles two or three, the better man the moe,



The chiefest Russies in the land, with spoone and knives doe goe.



Their houses are not huge of building, but they say,



They plant them in the loftiest ground, to shift the snow away,



Which in the Winter time, eache where full thicke doth lie:



Which makes them have the more desire, to set their houses hie.



No stone worke is in use, their roofes of rafters bee, One linked in another fast, their wals are all of tree.



Of masts both long, and large, with mosse put in betweene,



To keepe the force of weather out, I never earst have seene



A grosse devise so good, and on the roofe they lay



The burthen barke, to rid the raine, and sudden showres away.



In every roome a stove, to serve the Winter turne,



Of wood they have sufficient store, as much as they can burne.



They have no English glasse, of slices of a rocke



Hight Sluda they their windowes make, that English glasse doth mocke.



They cut it very thinne, and sow it with a thred In pretie order like to panes, to serve their present need.



No other glasse, good faith doth give a better light:



And sure the rocke is nothing rich, the cost is very [I. 3 8 7. J slight, in	129	i



The chiefest place is that, where hangs the god by it, The owner of the house himselfe doth never sit, Unlesse his better come, to whom he yealds the seat: The stranger bending to the god, the ground with brow must beat.



And in that very place which they most sacred deeme, The stranger lies: a token that his guest he doth esteeme.



Where he is wont to have a beares skinne for his bed, And must, in stead of pillow, clap his saddle to his head.



In Russia other shift there is not to be had,



For where the bedding is not good, the boalsters are but bad.



I mused very much, what made them so to lie,



Sith in their countrey Downe is rife, and feathers out of crie:



Unlesse it be because the countrey is so hard,



They feare by nicenesse of a bed their bodies would be mard,



I wisht thee oft with us, save that I stood in feare



Thou wouldst have loathed to have layd thy limmes upon a beare,



As I and Stafford did, that was my mate in bed:



And yet (we thanke the God of heaven) we both right well have sped.



Loe thus I make an ende: none other newes to thee, But that the countrey is too colde, the people beastly bee.



I write not all I know, I touch but here and there,



For if I should, my penne would pinch, and eke offend I feare.



Who so shall read this verse, conjecture of the rest, And thinke by reason of our trade, that I do thinke the best.



But if no traffique were, then could I boldly pen



The hardnesse of the soile, and eke the maners of the men.



130



They say the Lions paw gives judgement of the beast:



And so may you deeme of the great, by reading of the least.



To Parker.



MY Parker, paper, pen, and inke were made to write,



And idle heads, that little do, have leisure to indite: Wherefore, respecting these, and thine assured love, If I would write no newes to thee, thou might’st my pen reprove.



And sithence fortune thus hath shov’d my shippe on shore:



And made me seeke another Realme unseene of me before:



The maners of the men I purpose to declare,



And other private points besides, which strange and geazon are.



The Russie men are round of bodies, fully fac’d,



The greatest part with bellies bigge that overhang the waste,



Flat headed for the most, with faces nothing faire,



But browne, by reason of the stove, and closenesse of the aire:



It is their common use to shave or els to sheare



Their heads, for none in all the land long lolling locks doth weare,



Unlesse perhaps he have his sovereigne prince displeas’d,



For then he never cuts his haire, untill he be appeas’d.



A certaine signe to know who in displeasure be,



For every man that viewes his head, will say, Loe this is he.



And during all the time he lets his locks to grow, Dares no man for his life to him a face of friendship show.



Their garments be not gay, nor handsome to the eye, 131



A cap aloft their heads they have, that standeth very hie, Which Colpack they do terme. They weare no ruffes at all:



The best have collers set with pearle, which they Rubasca call.



Their shirts in Russie long, they worke them downe before,



And on the sleeves with coloured Silks, two inches good and more.



Aloft their shirts they weare a garment jacket wise Hight Onoriadka, and about his burlie waste he tyes [I. 388.J His portkies, which in stead of better breeches be:



Of linnen cloth that garment is, no codpiece is to see. A paire of yarnen stocks to keepe the colde away, Within his boots the Russie weares, the heeles they underlay



With clouting clamps of steele, sharpe pointed at the toes, And over all a Shuba furd, and thus the Russie goes. Well butned is the Shube, according to his state, Some Silke, of Silver other some: but those of poorest rate



Do weare no Shubs at all, but grosser gownes to sight, That reacheth downe beneath the calfe, and that Armacha hight:



These are the Russies robes. The richest use to ride From place to place, his servant runnes, and followes by his side.



The Cassacke beares his felt, to force away the raine: Their bridles are not very brave, their saddles are but plaine.



No bits but snaffles all, of birch their saddles be, Much fashioned like the Scottish seates, broad flakes to keepe the knee



From sweating of the horse, the panneis larger farre



And broader be then ours, they use short stirrups for the warre:



For when the Russie is pursued by cruel foe,



He rides away, and suddenly betakes him to his boe,



132



And bends me but about in saddle as he sits, And therewithal! amids his race his following foe he hits. Their bowes are very short, like Turkie bowes outright,



Of sinowes made with birchen barke, in cunning maner dight.



Small arrowes, cruel heads, that fell and forked bee,



Which being shot from out those bowes, a cruel way will flee.



They seidome use to shoo their horse, unlesse they ride



In post upon the frozen flouds, then cause they shall not slide,



He sets a slender calke, and so he rides his way.



The horses of the countrey go good fourescore versts a day,



And all without the spurre, once pricke them and they skippe,



But goe not forward on their way, the Russie hath his whippe



To rappe him on the ribbes, for though all booted bee, Yet shall you not a paire of spurres in all the countrey see.



The common game is chesse, almost the simplest will



Both give a checke and eke a mate, by practise comes their skill.



Againe they dice as fast, the poorest rogues of all



Will sit them downe in open field, and there to gaming fall.



Their dice are very small, in fashion like to those



Which we doe use, he takes them up, and over thumbe he throwes



Not shaking them a whit, they cast suspiciously,



And yet I deeme them voyd of art that dicing most apply.



At play when Silver lacks, goes saddle, horse and all,



And eche thing els worth Silver walkes, although the price be small.



Because thou lovest to play friend Parker other while,



133



I wish thee there the weary day with dicing to beguile. But thou weart better farre at home, I wist it well, And wouldest be loath among such lowts so long a time to dwell.



Then judge of us thy friends, what kinde of life we had, That neere the frozen pole to waste our weary dayes were glad.



In such a savage soile, where lawes do beare no sway, But all is at the king his will, to save or els to slay. And that sans cause, God wot, if so his minde be such. But what meane I with Kings to deale ? we ought no Saints to touch.



Conceive the rest your selfe, and deeme what lives they lead,



Where lust is Lawe, and Subjects live continually in dread.



And where the best estates have none assurance good



Of lands, of lives, nor nothing falles unto the next of blood.



But all of custome doeth unto the prince redowne, [I. 389.] And all the whole revenue comes unto the King his crowne.



Good faith I see thee muse at what I tell thee now, But true it is, no choice, but all at princes pleasure bow. So Tarquine ruled Rome as thou remembrest well, And what his fortune was at last, I know thy selfe canst tell.



Where will in Common weale doth beare the onely sway,



And lust is Lawe, the prince and Realme must needs in time decay.



The strangenesse of the place is such for sundry things



1 see,



As if I woulde I cannot write ech private point to thee.



The colde is rare, the people rude, the prince so full of pride,



The Realme so stored with Monks and nunnes, and priests on every side :



T34



The maners are so Turkie like, the men so full of guile, The women wanton, Temples stuft with idols that defile The Seats that sacred ought to be, the customes are so quaint,



As if I would describe the whole, I feare my pen would feint.



In summe, I say I never saw a prince that so did raigne,



Nor people so beset with Saints, yet all but vile and vaine.



Wilde Irish are as civill as the Russies in their kinde, Hard choice which is the best of both, ech bloody, rude and blinde.



If thou bee wise, as wise thou art, and wilt be ruld by me, Live still at home, and covet not those barbarous coasts to see.



No good befalles a man that seeks, and findes no better place,



No civill customes to be learnd, where God bestowes no grace.



And truely ill they do deserve to be belov’d of God, That neither love nor stand in awe of his assured rod : Which though be long, yet plagues at last the vile and beastly sort



Of sinfull wights, that all in vice do place their chiefest sport.



A dieu friend Parker, if thou list, to know the Russes well,



To Sigismundus booke repaire, who all the trueth can tell :



For he long earst in message went unto that savage King,



Sent by the Pole, and true report in ech respect did bring,



To him I recommend my selfe, to ease my penne of paine,



And now at last do wish thee well, and bid farewell againe.
