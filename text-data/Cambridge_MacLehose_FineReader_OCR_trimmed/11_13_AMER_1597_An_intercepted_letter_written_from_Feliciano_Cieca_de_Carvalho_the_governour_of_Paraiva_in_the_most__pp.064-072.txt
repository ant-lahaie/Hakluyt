A speciali letter written from Feliciano Cieza de Carvalsho the Governour of Parajua in the most Northerne part of Brasil, 1597, to Philip the second king of Spaine, answering his desire touching the conquest of Rio Grande, with the relation of the besieging of the castle of Cabodelo by the Frenchmen, and of the discoverie of a rich silver mine and diverse other important matters.



Received your Majesties letter bearing date the ninth of November 1596. whereby I understande that your Majestie doth determine to proceede in



the discoverie and conquest of Rio Grande, according to the relation which was sent your Majestie by Don Francisco de Sousa, Governour general of this realme of Brasilia:



together with a copie of a letter, which your Majestie sent unto us, bearing date the two and twentieth of March 1596. Moreover I received another letter from your Majestie bearing date the 15 of March 1597. Both which letters were to one effect. It may please your Majestie to understand that there are diverse Gentlemen in these countreys of as good abilitie as my selfe, which seeke to live at home onely for their ease and pleasure, and are not wont to hazard nor venture their bodies, lives, and goods so often times in your Majesties service as I have done and commonly doe ; and can keepe their goods and riches, and not spend nor wast them as I have done, and dayly doe so wilfully: yet neverthelesse being spent in your Majesties service, I am very glad thereof. For I and they are alwayes readie at your Majesties com-mandement.



And as concerning your Majesties commandement in commanding me that I should put to my helping hand in the conquest of Rio Grande: although this Captaineship of Parajua and countrey where I doe TheCaptaine-governe doth want abilitie for that purpose, yet never- °f thelesse your Majestie shall alwayes finde me readie to s^^h-tn doe your Majestie the best service I can: for it is sixe degr. 45 very well knowen how forward I have bene alwayes min. of and am in this conquest, and still doe put to my s°u&erly lati-helping hand, as pardy your Majestie doth under- u e' stand by a letter which I wrote to your Majesty by my sonne, bearing date the 19 of March 1596 wherein your Majestie may understand what good service I have alreadie done therein, and alwayes will be readie to my power to doe the like in furthering of the said enterprise.



It may please your Majestie to understand that the third of July there was brought unto me a Frenchman a prisoner, who presented himselfe unto me. And I examining of him, he tolde me that he came running away from certaine French ships men xi	65	E



of warre, which came upon this coast: and he tolde me that he had served your Majestie in the warres of France. Likewise he told me that he left me seven great ships Frenchmen of warre riding at an anker in Rio Grande, and that there were 13 french ships of warre more, which had given battery to the The castle of castle of Cabodelo, and landed 3 50 soldiers all in ^'u^b ^the w^xte armour> and the battery continued from Friday French. untill the Munday following both by sea and land, and great store of Frenchmen were slaine, and two Captaines of the French. On our side the Captaine of the castle was slaine,	and other	two	Portugal»



hurt: other harme they had none. There were but twentie Portugals in the	castle,	and	five	pieces of



ordinance. They ment to have kept the castle, and to have traded with the	Indian	people.	So seeing



they could not take the	castle,	they	hoysed sayles,



and went from thence to Rio Grande: and being altogether they are in number 20 saile at an anker in Rio Grande. And some of them determine after they be new trimmed and drest, and have taken in fresh victuals, and stayed there untill Easter, then to depart from thence to the Honduras, and so to burne and spoyle some townes thereabout.



I certified Manuel Mascarenhas of these informations, by my letters, requesting him to send me with all expedi-The garison tion those souldiers which were in garison in Fernambuck of Femam- to ayje me> and to defende this Captaineship from the ’ enemie. But the Friers of The Covent would not consent thereunto, nor suffer them to be sent unto me. So I was forced to make shift with those souldiers only which I had in my government and tooke them with me, and marched to the place where the enemies were entrenched, and upon Whitsunday in the evening about The countrey three of the clocke, having in my company a Negro of ofPetig^ar countrey of Petiguar, which was our guide, he against the brought us where the enemies campe was; and presently Portugals. I did assault them, and slew great store of them, burning 66



T597-the villages and countrey of those rebels, which did joine with the Frenchmen, and tooke many of them prisoners.



So they told me that there were ten great French ships of warre which were at an anker in Rio Grande.



Likewise I was informed, that there is a Frenchman called Daurmigas, which hath discovered and found great store	of silver in a place	called	Copaoba. The	A rich silver

from this Captaineship.



Furthermore this Frenchman told me that one Monsieur Mifa a french Captaine, and a kinsman of the governour and Viceadmirall of Diepe in Normandie, had one of his armes strooken off at the siege of the castle of Cabodelo; who is departed from Rio Grande, with determination to come backe hither againe the next yeere in the moneth of Januarie following, and to inhabite in this countrey of Paraiba, which is 20 leagues from Fernambuck, because of the great store of silver, which they have alreadie found here.



Moreover I am enformed that a noble man of France called The earle of Villa Dorca doth intend to come upon this coast with a great fleete from Rochel. It were good that your Majestie would send into France to knowe the certainetie thereof.



The Frenchman likewise told me that all the Canibals All the Cani-of Petiguar have ioyned themselves in companie with bals rfPett-certaine Frenchmen, which were cast away in two with Jt^ ships upon this coast. The one of these ships which Frenchmen were cast away was one Rifoles, and the other ship against the was this mans.	And those Frenchmen which came PortuSals-



upon this coast did joyne themselves with those Canibals which did rebell, and did divide themselves into two squadrons. So I sent presently to Manuel



French ships laden with great store oj silver oare.

Mascarenhas that he should send me aide and munition. But he sent me word againe, that he had none to spare, and that he did purpose with all speede to goe himselfe to Rio Grande; and that he was not able to furnish himselfe so well as he could wish, nor to bring his souldiers into the field, for lacke of shot, powder, and other munition, which he did want.



Hereupon once more the 29 of July I with my souldiers marched to the enemies campe, and there joyning battell with the Indian rebels, which were joyned with the Frenchmen that were their leaders, I did set upon them, and slew great store of them, and tooke foureteene of them prisoners. They doe report the very same newes, which the other Frenchmen did tell me as touching the ships which were in the harbour of Rio Grande; and how their pretence was to have come and have taken us, and spoyled the countrey.



But now being put to flight and having received the overthrow, they can get no victuals to victuali their shippes: which hath bene the cause that they are mightily hindered in their intent, and dare not come any more to attempt us. And the Indians are so dismayed, that in haste they will have no more helpe nor aide of the Frenchmen. So by these meanes of necessitie the Indians must submit themselves unto us, considering they are quite spoyled and overthrowen for a long time. Likewise they have enformed me touching the silver mines which are found, that it is most true. For those french shippes which were in Rio Grande have laden great store of the oare. Wherefore I certified Manuel de Mascarenhas of the Frenchmens newes, and howe every thing did stand; wishing him to make readie foure ships and three hundred souldiers, and so to take the harbour of Rio Grande, being now cleered and voyde of the enemie: and to search out the situation of the place, and where were best to fortifie and to build some fortes for the defence of



this river, where neede shall require. Hereunto Mascarenhas sent me word, that when he went himselfe, and found it true which hath beene reported touching the silver mines, that then he would send both men and ships. Therefore your Majestie must give order, that the rest of the Governours shall ayde and assist me in these warres: otherwise of my selfe I am not able to doe more then I have alreadie done in defending of this countrey against our enemies which are many.



It may please your Majestie to be advertised, that from time to time I have written unto Don Francisco de Sousa Governor general of this realme, who is in Baia, as concerning these Frenchmen of warre: but he will not answere me to any purpose, because I do write unto him for such things as I doe want, which are shot, powder, men, and munition requisite for your Majesties service & safegard of this captaineship. For here are neither shot, powder, nor any thing els to defend us from our enemies; nor any that wil put to their helping hands for the defence of this countrey, & the service of your Majestie. And therefore it were needful that your Majesty should commit the charge and government into the hands of Diego Sierva, with expresse charge that all the captaines & commanders upon paine of death obey him and be readie at all times to aide and assist him in your service. Otherwise this countrey cannot be kept and maintained, having so great warres continually as we have, and are troubled withall. For this Diego Sierva is a very good souldier, and hath good experience; and is fit to governe this ;countrey. Your Highnesse is also to send him Commission with expresse commandement to follow these wars; otherwise this countrey cannot be kept, but daily they will rebell. For here are none that will serve your Majestie so justly as he will do: who wil have a great care in any thing which shal concerne your Majesties service touching the [III. 718.] estate of this countrey. For the Governour Sousa doth

spend your Majesties treasure in building his owne Ingenios or sugar-milles.



And those Captaines which your Majestie intendeth to send hither must bring with them shot, powder, and all kind of weapons, furniture, and munition for the defence and safegarde of this countrey, and for the conquest of Rio Grande. For there is no kind of munition in al this countrey to be had, if occasion should serve. It were also good that your Majestie should send order for the building of a couple of Forts or Castles at Cabodelo, for they be very needefull for the defence of the enemie, which dayly doth warre against this Captaineship. For that man which shall governe this countrey, if he be no more fortunate than I have bene hitherto, shall not misse one time or another, but he shall . . loose all the countrey. If Don Francisco de Sousa had danger Jdayly sent mee t^086 two hundred and fiftie souldiers which I to be lost.	did send for, which were in garison in the castle of



Arrecife, which doe nothing but spend your Majesties victuals and treasure, and had not sent them to Baiha, The warres where there was no neede, these warres of Petiguar had of etiguar. bene ended long agone, and had saved your Majesty a great deale of charges which you had spent in folowing of A new cap- this conquest of Rio Grande. I have chosen one Cap-taine John de Matas Cardoso to be Governour of Cabodelo, who is a very sufficient man.



A great con- Furthermore, it may please your Majestie to under-^cUn6the stand> that the chiefest Friers of this Monasterie of S. government of Antonie have complained on me to the lord Governour the Indian general, and have caused great strife and debate betweene townes. him anj me touching the government and rule of these Indian townes. For the Friers would command and governe both the Indians and their townes as well in Ecclesiasticall as Temporali causes, as touching the punishment of the bodies of such as are offenders. But I have resisted them in your Majesties name, and have alleaged, that none but your Majestie must rule and governe them and their countrey, and that the townes appertaine 70



to your Majestie, and not unto the Friers. But the Governour hath written a letter unto me, signifying that he hath pronounced a sentence against me in the Friers behalfe, which is this. The King our master hath sent a decree and certaine statutes touching the good government and orders to be executed and kept in those Indian townes: and that upon sight hereof I shall presently banish all the Mamalukes and white men which dwell in any of those Indian townes with all speede, and that none of them from hence forward shall enter into the said villages, without commandement and consent of the said Friers. So this sentence was presented unto me by the Reverend father Custodio, Prior of Sant Anton of Brasil, with a further postscript of the governour importing these words; I doe likewise charge and commaund you the Governour of Parajua, that presently upon sight hereof you shall restore those villages and houses which you have burned and destroyed in the last warres, and likewise the towne of Thetowne of S. Augustine, and that you shall build them againe at & Au&ustine-your owne proper cost and charges: for the Friers alleage that these townes were given them, by a decree sent them from Pope Pius Quintus, that the said Friers should governe and rule them.



On the other side I have pronounced another sentence against the said Friers, in your Majesties name, and for your Majestie, alleaging that those townes, villages, and subjects appertaine and belong unto your Majestie, and that in temporali causes I am to punish those offenders, which shall rebell against your Majestie: and as touching ecclesiastical causes that the Vicar of this Cathedrall church shall rule, governe and instruct them in the Christian religion. So we both have appealed unto your Majestie herein, and your Majestie may peruse all our writings, and then determine that which shall be best and most profitable for your Majesties service and enlargement of your crowne. For through these broyles the inhabitants of this Parajua forsake their houses



& dwelling places, and so doe some of the Friers, because they cannot be suffered to rule & governe.



Also the Indians have complayned against me, because I have burned their villages in this last rebellion. Wherefore if your Majestie doe not send some order for this countrey and see into these cases, it will breed great dissention and rebellion among us, and we shall be readie to cut one anothers throat before it be long.



Thus I thought good, according to my humble bounden dutie, and for the service of your Majestie and quietnesse of this realme, to certifie your Majestie the truth of the whole matter ; hoping in short time that your Majestie will send some good order to qualifie these broyles: for there is great hatred and malice among us. Jesus Christ preserve and keepe the royall person of your Majestie with long health, as it pleaseth him. From the Captaineship of Parajua this present 20 of August. 1597.
