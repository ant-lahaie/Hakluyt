Ambassadors Allowances.



THe Ambassadour of the Emperor is allowed one thousand Aspers the day.



The Ambassadour of the French king heretofore enjoyed the like: but of late yeeres by meanes of 68



displeasure conceived by Mahumet then Viceroy, it was reduced to sixe crownes the day, beside the provision of his Esquier of his stable.



The Ambassadours of Poland, and for the state of Venice are not Ligiers as these two abovesaid. The said Polack is allowed 12. French crownes the day during his abode, which may be for a moneth. Very seidome do the state of Venice send any Ambassador otherwise, then enforced of urgent necessity: but in stead thereof keepe their Agent, president over other Marchants, of them termed a bailife, who hath none allowance of the Grand Signior, although his port & state is in maner as magnifical as the other aforesaid ambassadors. The Spanish Ambassador was equall with others in Janizaries: but for so much as he would not according to custome folow the list of other ambassadors in making presents to ye Grand Signior, he had none alowance. His abode there was 3. yeres, at the end wherof, having concluded a truce for 6. yeres, taking place from his first comming in November last past 1580. he was not admitted to the presence of the Grand Signior.
