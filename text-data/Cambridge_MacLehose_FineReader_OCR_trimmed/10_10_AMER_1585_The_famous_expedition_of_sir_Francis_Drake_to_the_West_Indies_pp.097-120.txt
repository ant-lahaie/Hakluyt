After our going hence, which was the foureteenth of September, in the yeere of our Lord 1585. and taking our course towards Spaine, wee had the winde for a fewe dayes somewhat skant, and sometimes calme. And being arrived neere that part of Spaine, which is called the Moores, wee happened to espie divers sailes, which kept their course close by the shore, the weather being faire and calme. The general caused the Viceadmirall to goe with the pinnesses well manned to see what they were, who upon sight of the said pinnesses approching neere unto them, abandoned for the most part all their ships (being Frenchmen) laden all with salt, and bound homewards into France, amongst which ships (being all of small burthen) there was one so wel liked, which also had no man in her, as being brought unto ye general, he thought good to make stay of her for the service, meaning to pay for her, as also accordingly he performed at our returne: which barke was called the Drake. The rest of these ships (being eight or nine) were dismissed without any thing at all taken from them. Who being after-wardes put somewhat farther off from the shore, by the contrariety of the wind, we happened to meet with some other French ships, full laden with Newland fish, being upon their returne homeward from the said Newfoundland: whom the general after some speech had with them (and seeing plainly that they were Frenchmen) dismissed, without once suffering any man to go aboord of them.



The day following standing in with the shore againe, we discried another tall ship of twelve score tunnes or thereaboutes, upon whom Master Carliel the Lieutenant 99



[HL 535-J



general being in the Tygar, undertooke the chase, whom also anon after the Admirall followed, and the Tygar having caused the said strange ship to strike her sailes, kept her there without suffering any body to go aboord untill the Admirall was come up: who forthwith sending for the Master, and divers others of their principali men, and causing them to be severally examined, found the ship and goods to be belonging to the inhabitants of S. Sebastian in Spaine, but the mariners to bee for the most part belonging to S. John de Luz, and the Passage. In this ship was great store of dry Newland fish, commonly called with us Poore John, whereof afterwards (being thus found a lawfull prize) there was distribution made into all the ships of the fleet, the same being so new and good, as it did very greatly bestead us in the whole course of our voyage. A day or two after the The Isles of taking of this ship, we put in within the Isles of Bayon, Bayona. for iacke of favourable wind: where wee had no sooner ankered some part of the fleete, but the general commanded all the pinnesses with the shipboats to be manned, and every man to be furnished with such armes as were needful for that present service; which being done, the general put himselfe into his gallie, which was also well furnished, and rowing towards the city of Bayon, with intent, and the favour of the Almighty to surprise it, before we had advanced one halfe league of our way, there came a messenger being an English merchant from the Governour, to see what strange fleet we were, who came to our General, conferred a while with him, and after a small time spent, our general called for Captaine Sampson, and willed him to go to the Governour of the citie, to resolve him of two points. The first, to know if there were any warres betweene Spaine and England. The second, why our marchants with their goods were embarged or arrested. Thus departed captain Sampson with the said messenger to the citie, where he found the governour & people much amazed of such a sudden accident.



100



The general with the advise and counsell of M. Carleil



his Lieutenant general, who was in the galley with him, thought not good to make any stand, till such time as they were within the shot of the citie, where they might bee ready upon the returne of Captaine Sampson, to make a sudden attempt if cause did require before it were darke.



Captaine Sampson returned with his message in this sort. First, touching peace or warres the Governour said he knew of no warres, and that it lay not in him to make any, hee being so meane a subject as he was. And as for the stay of the merchants with their goods, it was the kings pleasure, but not with intent to endomage any man. And that the kings counter-commandement was (which had bene received in that place some sevennight before) that English merchants with their goods should be discharged: for the more verifying wherof, he sent such merchants as were in the towne of our nation, who traffiqued those parts: which being at large declared to our General by them, counsell was taken what might best be done. And for that the night approched, it was thought needful to land our forces, which was done in the shutting up of the day, & having quartered our selves to our most advantage, with sufficient gard upon every strait, we thought to rest our selves for that night there. The Governour sent us some refreshing, as bread, wine, oyle, apples, grapes, marmalad and such like. About midnight the weather beganne to overcast, insomuch that it was thought meeter to repaire aboord, then to make any longer abode on land, and before wee could recover the Fleete, a great tempest arose, which caused many of our shippes to drive from their anker-hold, and some were forced to sea in great perill, as the barke Talbot, the barke Hawkins, and the Speedewell, which Speedewel was [III. 536.] onely driven into England, the others recovered us againe: the extremitie of the storme lasted three dayes, which no sooner began to asswage, but M. Carleil our Lieutenant general was sent with his owne shippe and three others: as also with the gallie and with divers



IOI



pinnesses, to see what he might doe above Vigo, where hee tooke many boates and some caravels, diversly laden with things of small value, but chiefly with houshold stufie, running into the high countrey, and amongst the rest, he found one boat laden with the principal church-stuffe of the high Church of Vigo, where also was their great crosse of silver, of very faire embossed worke, and double gilt all over, having cost them a great masse of money. They complained to have lost in all kind of goods above thirty thousand duckets in this place.



The next day the general with his whole fleete went from up the Isles of Bayon, to a very good harbour above Vigo, where M. Carleil stayed his comming, aswell for the more quiet riding of his ships, as also for the good commoditie of fresh watering, which the place there did afourd full well. In the meane time the Governour of Galicia had reared such forces as hee might, his numbers by estimate were some two thousand foot, and three hundred horse, and marched from Bayon to this part of the countrey, which lay in sight of our fleete, where making a stand, he sent to parley with our general, which was granted by our general, so it might bee in boats upon the water: and for safetie of their persons, there were pledges delivered on both sides: which done, the Governor of Galicia put himselfe with two others into our Viceadmirals skiffe, the same having bene sent to the shore for him, and in like sort our general went in his owne skifFe; where it was by them agreed, we should furnish our selves with fresh water, to be taken by our owne people quietly on the land, and have all other such necessaries, paying for the same, as the place would affburd.



When all our businesse was ended, wee departed, and tooke our way by the Islands of Canaria, which are esteemed some three hundred leagues from this part of Spaine, and falling purposely with Palma, with intention to have taken our pleasure of that place, for the full digesting of many things into order, and the better



102



furnishing our store with such severall good things as it affourdeth very abundantly, we were forced by the vile Sea-gate, which at that present fell out, and by the naughtinesse of the landing place, being but one, and that under the favour of many platformes well furnished with great ordinance, to depart with the receit of many of their Canon-shot, some into our ships, and some besides, some of them being in very deede full Canon high. But the only or chiefe mischiefe was the dangerous sea-surge, which at shore all alongst plainly threatned the overthrow of as many pinnesses and boates, as for that time should have attempted any landing at all.



Now seeing the expectation of this attempt frustrated by the causes aforesaid, we thought it meeter to fall with the Isle Hierro, to see if we could find any better fortune: and comming to the Island, we landed a thousand men in a valley under a high mountaine, where we stayed some two or three houres, in which time the inhabitants, accompanied with a yong fellow borne in England, who dwelt there with them, came unto us, shewing their state to be so poore, that they were all ready to starve, which was not untrue: and therefore without any thing gotten, we were all commanded presently to imbarke, so as that night wee put off to sea Southsoutheast along towards the coast of Barbary.



Upon Saturday in the morning, being the 13. of November, we fell with Cape Blanke, which is a low land and shallow water, where we catched store of fish, and doubling the Cape, we put into the Bay, where we found certaine French ships of warre, whom wee entertained with great courtesie, and there left them. This afternoone the whole fleet assembled, which was a little scattered about their fishing, and put from thence to the Isles of Cape Verde, sailing till the 16. of the same moneth in the morning, on which day we discried the Island of S. Iago, and in the evening we ankered the fleet between the towne called the Playa or Praya, and



103



S. Iago, where we put on shore 1000. men or more, under the leading of M. Christopher Carleil Lieutenant general, who directed the service most like a wise commander. The place where we had first to march did affourd no good order, for the ground was mountainous & full of dales, being a very stony and troublesome passage; but such was his industrious disposition, as he would never leave, untill wee had gotten up to a faire plain, where we made stand for the assembling of the army. And when we were al gathered together upon the plaine, some 2 miles from the town, the lieutenant general thought good not to make attempt til daylight: because there was not one that could serve for guid or giving knowledge at al of ye place. And therfore after having wel rested, even halfe an houre before day, he commanded the army to be divided into 3 speciali parts, such as he appointed, wheras before we had marched by several companies, being therunto forced by the badnesse of the way as is aforesaid.



Now by the time wee were thus ranged into a very brave order, daylight began to appeare, and being advanced hard to the wall, we saw no enemie to resist, whereupon the Lieutenant general appointed Captaine Sampson with thirtie shot, and Captaine Barton with other thirtie, to goe downe into the towne which stood in the valley under us, and might very plainely bee viewed all over from that place where the whole Army was now arrived: and presently after these Captaines was sent the great ensigne, which had nothing in it but the plaine English crosse, to be placed to-wardes the Sea, that our Fleet might see Saint Georges cross florish in the enemies fortresse. Order was given that all the ordinance throughout the towne and upon all the platformes, which were above fiftie pieces all ready charged, should be shot ofF in honour of the Queenes Majesties coronation day, being the seventeenth of November, after the yeerely custome of England, 104



which was so answered againe by the ordinance out of all the ships in the fleete which now was come neere, as it was strange to heare such a thundering noyse last so long together. In this meane while the Lieutenant general held still the most part of his force on the hill top, till such time as the towne was quartered out for the lodging of the whole Armie: which being done every captaine tooke his own quarter, and in the evening was placed such a sufficient gard upon every part of the towne that we had no cause to feare any present enemie.



Thus we continued in the citie the space of 14. The title of dayes, taking such spoiles as the place yeelded, which ta^en were for the most part, wine, oyle, meale, and some such like things for victuali, as vineger, olives, and some such other trash, as merchandise for their Indians trades.



But there was not found any treasure at all, or any thing else of worth besides.



The situation of S. Iago is somewhat strange, in forme like a triangle, having on the East and West sides two mountaines of rocke and cliffe, as it were hanging over it, upon the top of which two mountaines were builded certaine fortifications to preserve the towne from any harme that might bee offered, as in a plot is plainely shewed. From thence, on the South side of the towne is the maine sea, and on the North side, the valley lying betweene the foresayd mountaines, wherein the towne standeth: the said valley & towne both do grow very narrow, insomuch that the space betweene the two cliffes of this end of the towne is estimated not to be above 10. or 12. score over.



In the middest of the valley commeth downe a riveret, rill, or brooke of fresh water, which hard by the sea side maketh a pond or poole, whereout our ships were watered with very great ease and pleasure. Somewhat above the towne on the North side betweene the two mountains, the valley waxeth somewhat larger then at the townes end, which valley is wholly converted into iÂ°5



THE ENGLISH VOYAGES gardens and orchards well replenished with divers sorts of fruites, herbes and trees, as lymmons, orenges, sugar-canes, cochars or cochos nuts, plantans, potato-rootes, cucumbers, small and round onions, garlicke, and some other things not now remembered, amongst which the cochos nuts, and plantans are very pleasant fruites, the saide cochos hath a hard shell and a greene huske over it, as hath our walnut, but it farre exceedeth in great-nesse, for this cochos in his greene huske is bigger than any mans two fistes: of the hard shell many drinking cups are made here in England, and set in silver as I have often seene.



Next within this hard shell is a white rine resembling in shewe very much even as any thing may do, to the white of an egge when it is hard boyled. And within this white of the nut lyeth a water, which is whitish and very cleere, to the quantitie of halfe a pynt or thereaboutes, which water and white rine before spoken of, are both of a very coole fresh tast, and as pleasing as any thing may be. I have heard some hold opinion, that it is very restorative.



The plantan groweth in cods, somewhat like to beanes, but is bigger and longer, and much more thicke together on the stalke, and when it waxeth ripe, the meate which filleth the rine of the cod becommeth yellow, and is exceeding sweet and pleasant.



In this time of our being there hapned to come a Portugall to the Westerne fort, with a flag of truce, to whom Captaine Sampson was sent with Captaine Goring, who comming to the said messenger, he first asked them what nation they were, they answered Englishmen, hee then required to knowe if warres were betweene England and Spaine, to which they answered that they knew not, but if he would goe to their general he could best resolve him of such particulars, and for his assurance of passage and repassage, these Captaines made offer to ingage their credits, which he refused for that he was not sent from his Governor. Then they told him, if 106



his Governor did desire to take a course for the common benefit of the people and countrey, his best way were to come and present himselfe unto our noble and mercifull Governour sir Francis Drake, whereby hee might bee assured to find favour, both for himselfe and the inhabitantes. Otherwise within three dayes wee should march over the land, and consume with fire all inhabited places, and put to the sword all such living soules as wee shoulde chance upon: so thus much he tooke for the conclusion of his answere, and departing, hee promised to returne the next day, but we never heard more of him.



Upon the foure and twentieth of November, the general accompanied with the lieutenant general and sixe hundred men marched foorth to a village twelve miles within the land, called Saint Domingo, where the Governour and the Bishoppe with all the better sort were lodged, and by eight of the clocke wee came to it, finding the place abandoned, and the people fled into the mountaines: so we made stand a while to ease our selves, and partly to see if any would come to speake to us.



After we had well rested our selves, the general commaunded the troupes to march away homewards, in which retreat the enemie shewed themselves, both horse and foote, though not such force as durst encounter us: and so in passing sometime at the gase with them, it waxed late and towards night before we could recover home to S. Iago.



On Munday the sixe and twentieth of November, the general commaunded all the pinnesses with the boates, to use all diligence to imbarke the Annie into such shippes as every man belonged. The Lieutenant general in like sort commanded Captaine Goring and Lieutenant Tucker, with one hundred shot to make a stand in the market place, untill our forces were wholly imbarked, the viceadmiral making stay with his pinnesse & certaine boats in the harbour, to bring the sayd last

A wise course to be Imitated in all great actions.



THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



companie aboord the ships. Also the general willed forthwith the gallie with two pinnesses to take into them the company of Captaine Barton, and the company of Captaine Bigs, under the leading of captaine Sampson, to seeke out such munition as was hidden in the ground, at the towne of Praya or Playa, having bene promised to be shewed it by a prisoner, which was taken the day before.



The Captaines aforesayd comming to the Playa, landed their men, and having placed the troupe in their best strength, Captaine Sampson tooke the prisoner, and willed him to shewe that hee had promised, the which he could not, or at least would not: but they searching all suspected places, found two pieces of ordinance, one of yron, an other of brasse. In the after noone the general ankered with the rest of the Fleet before the Playa, comming himselfe ashore, willing us to burne the towne and make all haste aboord, the which was done by sixe of the clocke the same day, and our selves imbarked againe the same night, and so we put off to Sea Southwest.



But before our departure from the towne of S. Iago, wee established orders for the better government of the Army, every man mustered to his captaine, and othes were ministred to acknowledge her Majestie supreme Governour, as also every man to doe his uttermost endevour to advance the service of the action, and to yeeld due obedience unto the directions of the general and his officers. By this provident counsell, and laying downe this good foundation before hand, all things went forward in a 'due course, to the atchieving of our happy enterprise.



In all the time of our being here, neither the Governour for the king of Spaine, (which is a Portugall) neither the Bishop, whose authoritie is great, neither the inhabitants of the towne, or Island ever came at us (which we expected they should have done) to intreate us to leave them some part of their needfull provisions, 108



or at the least, to spare the ruining of their towne at our going away. The cause of this their unreasonable distrust (as I doe take it) was the fresh remembrance of the great wrongs they had done to old M. William Hawkins of Plimmouth, in the voyage he made 4. or 5. The treason of yeeres before, when as they did both breake their promise,the fortug.al5 and murthered many of his men, whereof I judge you have understood, & therefore it is needlesse to be re- Hawkins. peated. But since they came not at us, we left written in sundry places, as also in the spittle house, (which building was only appointed to be spared) the great discontentment & scorne we tooke at this their refraining to come unto us, as also at the rude maner of killing, & savage kind of handling the dead body of one of our boyes found by them stragling al alone, from whom they had taken his head and heart, and had stragled the other bowels about the place, in a most brutish and beastly maner.



In revenge whereof at our departing we consumed with fire all the houses, aswell in the countrey which we saw, as in the towne of S. Iago.



From hence putting off to the West Indies, wee were not many dayes at Sea, but there beganne among our people such mortalitie, as in fewe dayes there were dead above two or three hundred men. And until some seven or eight dayes after our comming from S. Iago, there had not died any one man of sicknesse in all the fleete: the sicknesse shewed not his infection wherewith so many were stroken, untill we were departed thence, and then seazed our people with extreme hot burning and continuall agues, whereof very fewe escaped with life, and yet those for the most part not without great alteration and decay of their wittes and strength for a long time after. In some that died were plainely shewed the small spots, which are often found upon those that [III. 539.] be infected with the plague: wee were not above eighteene dayes in passage betweene the sight of Saint Iago aforesaid, and the Island of Dominica, being the



109



first Island of the West Indies that we fell withall, the same being inhabited with savage people, which goe all naked, their skinne coloured with some painting of a reddish tawney, very personable and handsome strong men, who doe admit litle conversation with the Spanyards : for as some of our people might understand them, they had a Spaniard or twaine prisoners with them, neither doe I thinke that there is any safetie for any of our nation, or any other to be within the limits of their commandement, albeit they used us very kindly for those few houres of time which wee spent with them, helping our folkes to fill and carry on their bare shoulders fresh water from the river to our ships boates, and fetching from their houses great store of Tabacco, as also a kind of bread which they fed on, called Cassavi, very white and savourie, made of the rootes of Cassavi. In recompence whereof, we bestowed liberali rewards of glasse, coloured beades, and other things, which we had found at Saint Iago, wherewith (as it seemed) they rested very greatly satisfied, and shewed some sorowfull countenance when they perceived that we would depart.



From hence wee went to another Island Westward of it, called Saint Christophers Island, wherein we spent some dayes of Christmas, to refresh our sicke people, and to cleanse and ayre our ships. In which Island were not any people at all that we could heare of.



In which time by the General it was advised and resolved, with the consent of the Lieutenant general, the Vice-admiral, and all the rest of the Captaines to proceede to the great Islande of Hispaniola, aswell for that we knewe our selves then to bee in our best strength, as also the rather allured thereunto, by the glorious fame of the ci tie of S. Domingo, being the ancientest and chiefe inhabited place in all the tract of Countrey thereabouts. And so proceeding in this determination, by the way we mette a small Frigat, bound for the same place, the which the Vice-admirall tooke: and having duely examined the men that were in her,



IIO



there was one found, by whom wee were advertised, the Haven to be a barren Haven, and the shore or land thereof to bee well fortified, having a Castle thereupon furnished with great store of Artillerie, without the danger whereof was no convenient landing place within ten English miles of the Citie, to which the sayd Pilot tooke upon him to conduct us.



All things being thus considered on, the whole forces were commaunded in the Evening to embarke themselves in Pinnesses, boats, and other small barkes appoynted for this service. Our souldiers being thus imbarked, the general put himselfe into the barke Francis as Admirall, and all this night we lay on the sea, bearing small saile untill our arrivall to the landing place, which was about the breaking of the day, and so we landed, being Newyeeres day, nine or ten miles to the Westwards of that brave Citie of S. Domingo: for at that time nor yet is knowen to us any landing place, where the sea-surge doth not threaten to overset a Pinnesse or boate. Our general having seene us all landed in safetie, returned to his Fleete, bequeathing us to God, and the good conduct of Master Carliell our Lieutenant general: at which time, being about eight of the clocke, we began to march, and about noone time, or towards one of the clocke, we approched the towne, where the Gentlemen and those of the better sort, being some hundred and fiftie brave horses or rather more, began to present themselves ; but our small shot played upon them, which were so susteined with good proportion of pikes in all parts, as they finding no part of our troope unprepared to receive them (for you must understand they viewed all round about) they were thus driven to give us leave to proceed towards the two gates of the towne, which were the next to the seaward. They had manned them both, and planted their ordinance for that present, and sudden alarme without the gate, and also some troopes of small shot in Ambuscado upon the hie way side. We divided our whole force, being some thousand or twelve hundred



men into two partes, to enterprise both the gates at one instant, the Lieutenant general having openly vowed to Captaine Powel (who led the troope that entred the other gate) that with Gods good favour he would not rest untill our meeting in the market place.



Their ordinance had no sooner discharged upon our neere approch, and made some execution amongst us, though not much, but the Lieutenant general began forthwith to advance both his voice of encouragement, and pace of marching: the first man that was slaine with the ordinance being very neere unto himselfe: and thereupon hasted all that hee might, to keepe them from the recharging of the ordinance. And notwithstanding their Ambuscados, we marched or rather ran so roundly in to The citie of them, as pell mell wee entred the gates, and gave them S. Domingo more care every man to save himselfe by flight, then ' reason to stand any longer to their broken fight. Wee forthwith repayred to the market place: but to be more truely understood, a place of very faire spacious square ground, whither also came as had bene agreed Captaine [III. 540.] Powel with the other troope: which place with some part next unto it, we strengthened with Barricados, and there as the most convenient place assured our selves, the Citie being farre too spacious for so small and weary a troope to undertake to guarde. Somewhat after midnight, they who had the guard of the Castle, hearing us busie about the gates of the said Castle, abandoned the same: some being taken prisoners, and some fleeing away by the helpe of boates to the other side of the Haven, and so into the countrey.



The next day we quartered a litle more at large, but not into the halfe part of the towne, and so making substantiali trenches, and planting all the ordinance, that ech part was correspondent to other, we held this towne the space of one moneth.



In the which time happened some accidents, more then are well remembred for the present, but amongst other things, it chanced that the general sent on his message 112



to the Spanyards a Negro boy with a flagge of white, signifying truce, as is the Spanyards ordinarie maner to doe there, when they approch to speake to us: which boy unhappily was first mette withall by some of those, who had bene belonging as officers for the King in the Spanish Galley, which with the Towne was lately fallen into our hands, who without all order or reason, & contrary to that good usage wherewith wee had inter-tained their messengers, furiously strooke the poore boy thorow the body with one of their horsemens staves: with which wound the boy returned to the General, and after hee had declared the maner of this wrongfull crueltie, died foorthwith in his presence, wherewith the general being greatly passioned, commaunded the Provost Martiali, to cause a couple of Friers then prisoners, to be caried to the same place where the boy was stroken, accompanied with sufficient guard of our souldiers, and there presently to be hanged, dispatching at the same instant another poore prisoner, with this reason wherefore this execution was done, & with this message further, that until the party who had thus murdered the Generals messenger were delivered into our hands, to receive condigne punishment, there should no day passe, wherein there should not two prisoners be hanged, until they were all consumed which were in our hands.



Whereupon the day following, hee that had bene Captaine of the kings Galley, brought the offender to the townes end, offring to deliver him into our hands ; but it was thought to be a more honourable revenge to make them there in our sight, to performe the execution themselves : which was done accordingly.



During our being in this towne, as formerly also at S. Iago there had passed justice upon the life of one of our owne company for an odious matter, so heere likewise was there an Irishman hanged, for the murthering of his Corporali.



In this time also passed many treaties betweene their Commissioners and us, for ransome of their Citie; but



x	113	H



upon disagreements we still spent the early mornings in fiering the outmost houses : but they being built very magnificently of stone, with high loftes, gave us no small travell to ruine them. And albeit for divers dayes together we ordeined ech morning by day breake, until the heat began at nine of the docke, that two hundred Mariners did nought els but labour to fire and burne the said houses without our trenches, whilst the souldiers in a like proportion stood forth for their guard : yet did wee not, or could not in this time consume so much as one third part of the towne: which towne is plainely described and set forth in a certaine Map. And so in the end, what wearied with firing, and what hastened by some other respects, wee were contented to accept of five and twentie thousand Ducats of five shillings sixe pence the peece, for the ransome of the rest of the towne.



Amongst other things which happened and were found at S. Domingo, I may not omit to let the world know one very notable marke & token of the unsatiable ambition of the Spanish king and his nation, which was found in the kings house, wherein the chiefe governour of that Citie and Countrey is appoynted alwayes to lodge, which was this: In the comming to the Hall or other roomes of this house, you must first ascend up by a faire large paire of staires ; at the head of which staires is a handsome



spacious place to walke in, somewhat like unto a gallery : wherein upon one of the wals, right over against you as you enter the said place, so as your eye cannot escape the sight of it, there is described & painted in a very large Scutchion the armes of the king of Spaine, and in the lower part of the said Scutchion, there is likewise described



a Globe, conteining in it the whole circuit of the sea and the earth wherupon is a horse standing on his hinder part within the globe, and the other fore-part without the globe, lifted up as it were to leape, with a scroll painted in his mouth, wherein was written these words in Latin, Non sufficit orbis : which is as much to say, as the world sufficeth not. Whereof the meaning was required to be

1586. knowen of some of those of the better sort, that came in commission to treate upon the ransome of the towne, who would shake their heads, and turne aside their countenance in some smyling sort, without answering any thing, as greatly ashamed thereof. For by some of our company it was tolde them, that if the Queene of England [III. 541.] would resolutely prosecute the warres against the king of Spaine, hee should be forced to lay aside that proude and unreasonable reaching vaine of his : for hee should finde more then inough to doe to keepe that which hee had alreadie, as by the present example of their lost towne they might for a beginning perceive well inough.



Now to the satisfying of some men, who marvell greatly that such a famous and goodly builded Citie so well inhabited of gallant people, very brave in their apparell (whereof our souldiers found good store for their reliefe) should afoord no greater riches then was found there: herein it is to be understood that the Indian people, which were the naturals of this whole Island of Hispaniola (the same being neere hand as great as England) were many yeeres since cleane consumed by the tyrannic of the Spanyards, which was ye cause, that for lacke of people to worke in the Mines, the golde and silver Mines of this Island are wholy given over, and thereby they are faine in this Island to use Copper money, whereof was found very great quantitie. The chiefe trade of this place consisteth of Sugar and Ginger, which groweth in the Island, and of Hides of oxen and kine, which in this waste countrey of the Island are bredde in infinite numbers, the soyle being very fertile: and the sayd beasts are fedde up to a very large grouth, and so killed for nothing so much, as for their Hides aforesayd. Wee found heere great store of strong wine, sweete oyle, vineger, olives, and other such like provisions, as excellent Wheate-meale packed up in winepipes and other caske, and other commodities likewise, as Woollen and Linnen cloth, and some Silkes: all which provisions are brought out of Spaine, and served us for â5



great reliefe. There was but a little Plate or vessell of Silver, in comparison of the great pride in other things of this towne, because in these hotte Countreys they use much of those earthen dishes finely painted or varnished, which they call Porcellana, which is had out of the East India : & for their drinking, they use glasses altogether, whereof they make excellent good and faire in the same place. But yet some plate we found, and many other good things, as their houshold garniture very gallant and rich, which had cost them deare, although unto us they were of small importance.



From Saint Domingo we put over to the maine or firme land, and going all alongst the coast, we came at Cartagena, the last in sight of Cartagena, standing upon the sea side, so neere, as some of our barks in passing alongst, approched within the reach of their Culverin shot, which they had planted upon certaine platformes. The Harbour mouth lay some three miles toward the Westward of the towne, whereinto wee entred about three or foure of the clocke in the afternoone without any resistance of ordinance, or other impeachment planted upon the same. In the Evening we put our selves on land towards the harbour mouth, under the leading of Master Carliell our Lieutenant general, who after hee had digested us to march forwarde about midnight, as easily as foote might fall, expresly commanded us to keepe close by the sea-wash of the shore for our best & surest way, whereby we were like to goe through, and not to misse any more of the way, which once wee had lost within an houre after our first beginning to march, through the slender knowledge of him that tooke upon him to be our guide, whereby the night spent on, which otherwise must have bene done by resting. But as we came within some two miles of the towne, their horsemen which were some hundred, met us, and taking the alarme, retired to their townward againe upon the first volley of our shot that was given them: for the place where wee encountred being



116



wooddy and bushy even to the water side was unmeete for their service.



At this instant we might heare some pieces of Artillerie discharged, with divers small shot towards the harbour, which gave us to understand, according to the order set downe in the Evening before by our general, that the Vice-admirall accompanied with Captaine Venner, Captaine White, and Captaine Crosse, with other sea Captaines, and with divers Pinnesses and boates should give some attempt unto the litle Fort standing on the entrie of the inner Haven, neere adjoyning to the towne, though to small purpose, for that the was strong, and the entry very narrow was chained over: so as there could be nothing gotten by the attempt, more than the giving of them an alarme on that other side of the Haven being a mile and a halfe from the place we now were at. In which attempt the Vice-admirall had the rudder of his skiffe stroken through with a Saker shot, and a litle or no harme received elsewhere.



The troopes being now in their march, halfe a myle behither the Towne or lesse, the ground we were on grewe to bee streight, and not above fiftie paces over, having the maine Sea on the one side of it, and the harbour-water or inner sea (as you may tearme it) on the other side, which in the plot is plainely shewed. This streight was fortified cleane over with a stone wall and a ditch without it: the sayd wall being as orderly built with flanking in every part, as can be set downe. There was onely so much of this streight unwalled, as might serve for the issuing of the horsemen, or the passing of caryage in time of neede : but this unwalled part was not without a very good Barricado of wine-buts or pipes, filled with earth, full and thicke as they might stand on ende one by another, some part of them standing even within the maine sea.



This place of strength was furnished with sixe great peeces, Demi-culverins, and Sakers, which shotte



117



[HI. 542-]



directly in front upon us as wee approched. Now without this wall upon the inner side of the streight, they had brought likewise two great Galleis with their prowes to the shore, having planted in them eleven peeces of ordinance, which did beate all crosse the streight, and flanked our comming on. In these two Galleis were planted three or foure hundred small shot, and on the land in the guard onely of this place, three hundred shot and pikes.



They in this their full readinesse to receive us, spared not their shot both great and small. But our Lieutenant general, taking the advantage of the darke (the day light as yet not broken out) approched by the lowest ground, according to the expresse direction which himselfe had formerly given, the same being the sea-wash shore, where the water was somewhat fallen, so as most of all their shot was in vaine. Our Lieutenant general commanded our shot to forbeare shooting untill we were come to the wall side, and so with pikes roundly together we approched the place, where we soone found out the Barricades of pipes or buts, to be the meetest place for our assault, which, notwithstanding it was well furnished with pikes and shot, was without staying attempted by us : downe went the buts of earth, and pell mell came our swordes and pikes together, after our shot had first given their volley, even at the enemies nose. Our pikes were somewhat longer then theirs, and our bodies better armed; for very few of them were armed: with which advantage our swordes and pikes grew too hard for them, and they driven to give place. In this furious entry, the Lieutenant general slew with his owne hands the chiefe Ensigne bearer of the Spaniards, who fought very manfully to his lives end.



We followed into the towne with them, and giving them no leasure to breath, we wanne the Market-place, albeit they made head, and fought a while before we got it, and so wee being once seazed and assured of 118



1586. that, they were content to suffer us to lodge within their towne, and themselves to goe to their wives, whom they had caryed into other places of the countrey before our comming thither.



At every streetes end they had raised very fine Barricados of earth-workes, with trenches without them, as well made as ever we saw any worke done: at the entring whereof was some litle resistance, but soone overcome it was, with few slaine or hurt. They had joyned with them many Indians, whom they had placed in corners of advantage, all bowmen, with their arrowes most villanously empoysoned, so as if they did but breake the skinne, the partie so touched died without great marvell: some they slew of our people with their arrowes : some they likewise mischieved to death with certaine pricks of small sticks sharply pointed, of a foote and a halfe long, the one ende put into the ground, the other empoysoned, sticking fast up, right against our comming in the way, as we should approch from our landing towardes the towne, whereof they had planted a wonderfull number in the ordinarie way : but our keeping the sea-wash shore missed the greatest part of them very happily.



I overpasse many particular matters, as the hurting of Captaine Sampson at sword blowes in the first entring, unto whom was committed the charge of the pikes of the Vantguard by his lot and turne ; as also of the taking of Alonso Bravo the chiefe commander of Ahnto Bravo that place by Captaine Goring, after the said captaine had first hurt him with his sword : unto which Captaine was committed the charge of the shot of the sayd Vantguard.



Captaine Winter was likewise by his turne of the Vantguard in this attempt, where also the Lieutenant general marched himselfe: the said Captaine Winter through a great desire to serve by land, having now exchanged his charge by sea with Captaine Cecil for his band of footemen.



119



Captaine Powel the Sergeant maior had by his turne the charge of the foure companies which made the battaile.



Captaine Morgan, who at S. Domingo was of the Vantguard, had now by turne his charge upon the companies of the Rereward.



Every man as well of one part as of another, came so willingly on to the service, as the enemie was not able to endure the furie of such hot assault.



We stayed here sixe weekes, and the sicknesse with mortalitie before spoken of still continued among us, though not with the same furie as at the first: and such as were touched with the sayde sicknesse, escaping death, very few or almost none could recover their strength : yea, many of them were much decayed in their memorie, insomuch that it was growen an ordinarie judgement, when one was heard to speake foolishly, to say he had bene sicke of the Calenture, which is the [III. 543.] Spanish name of their burning Ague : for as I tolde you before, it is a very burning and pestilent ague. The originali cause thereof, is imputed to the Evening or first night ayre, which they tearme La serena, wherein they say and hold very firme opinion, that who so is then abroad in the open ayre, shall certainly be infected to the death, not being of the Indian or natural race of those countrey people: by holding their watch, our men were thus subjected to the infectious ayre, which at S. Iago was most dangerous and deadly of all other places.



With the inconvenience of continuall mortalitie, we were forced to give over our intended enterprise to goe with Nombre de Dios, and so overland to Panama, where we should have strooken the stroke for the treasure, and full recompence of our tedious travailes. And thus at Cartagena wee tooke our first resolution to returne home-wardes: the forme of which resolution I thought good here to put downe under the principali Captaines hands, as followeth.
