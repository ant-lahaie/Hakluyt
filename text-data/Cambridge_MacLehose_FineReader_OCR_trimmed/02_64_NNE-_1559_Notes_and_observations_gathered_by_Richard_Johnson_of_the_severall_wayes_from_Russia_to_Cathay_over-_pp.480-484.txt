Further, as he hath heard (not having bene in those parts himselfe) ships may saile from the dominions of Cathaia unto India. But of other waies, or how the seas lie by any coast hee knoweth not.



The instruction of another Tartarian merchant dwelling in the citie of Boghar, as he hath learned by other his countreymen which have bene there.

From Serachick to Urgence is 15 dayes.



From Urgence to Boghar also 15 dayes.

complexion. Their religion also, as the Tartars report, is Christian, or after the maner of Christians, and their language peculiar, differing from the Tartarian tongue.



There are no great and furious Beares in travelling through the wales aforesaid, but wolves white and blacke. And because that woods are not of such quantitie there, as in these parts of Russia, but in maner rather scant then plentiful, as is reported, the Beares breed not that way, but some other beasts (as namely one in Russe called Barse) are in those coasts. This Barse appeareth by a skinne of one seene here to sell, to be nere so great as a big lion spotted very faire and therefore we here take it to be a Leopard or Tiger.



Note that 20 daies journey from Cathay is a countrey named Angrim, where liveth the beast that beareth the best Muske, & the principali therof is cut out of the knee of the male. The people are taunie, & for that the men are not bearded nor differ in complexion from women, they have certaine tokens of iron, that is to say: the men weare the sunne round like a bosse upon their shoulders, and women on their privie parts. Their feeding is raw flesh in the same land, and in another called * Titay : the Duke there is called Can. They worship the fire, and it is 34 dayes journey from great Cathay, and in the way lyeth the beautifull people, eating with knives of golde, and are called Comorom, and the land of small people is neerer the Mosko then Cathay.

Here follow certaine countreys of the Samoeds which dwell upon the river Ob, and upon the sea coasts beyond the same, taken out of the Russe tongue word by word, and travailed by a Russe borne in Colmogro, whose name was Pheodor Towtigin, who by report, was slaine in his second voyage in one of the said countreys.
