Which liberty in all respects is granted unto the Prussians in England.

bene by way of articles exhibited and delivered unto the sayd English ambassadours in the land of Prussia, which for divers causes, could not as then be ended : therefore it is concluded and agreed upon betweene the ambassadours, and the commissioners aforesayd, that the saide citizens and marchants may in the towne of Dordract in Holland, upon the first day of the moneth of May next ensuing (at the which time and place, the continuation and prorogation of all other articles not fully declared in the partes of Prussia, shall be put in ure) by themselves or their lawfull procurators, make their appearance, for the obtayning of a convenient, just, and reasonable reformation of all injuries attempted against them, then, or at some other times within one whole yere next following, and not afterward, being effectually set downe and limited, at the place aforesaid, by the consent of the ambassadours and commissioners of either parte, all lawfull impediments ceasing.



Provided alwayes, that the value and price of all wares, goods, and marchandises, whereof the said citizens and marchants of Livonia, in their articles received by the sayde English ambassadours, as is aforesayd, doe make mention, shall be justly esteemed, prized, and approoved, not by any of England, or of Prussia, or of Livonia, but by some other indifferent marchants of good credite, valuing them at the true rate of marchants, which such [I- 163.] like marchandise would have amounted unto, if, at the time when they were taken, they had bene to be solde at the town of Bruges in Flanders.



Forasmuch also, as divers and sundry Prussians (who exhibited manifolde Articles of complaints, being received by the said English Ambassadours, at their abode in Prussia) made not their personali appearance, before the saide English Ambassadours, in the lande of Prussia aforesaide : The prorogation above-mentioned was made unto the first day of the moneth of May : and also it was agreed upon by the saide Ambassadours, Procurators, and Commissioners, that the saide parties which had not 50



appeared before shall have libertie graunted them, lawfully to make their appearance, upon the first of May aforesaide, at the towne of Dordract, either by themselves or by their Procurators, and also to bring with them the letters testimonial, and patents, sealed with the seale of the saide Lord the Master generail, (he having first of all received sound and sufficient information from the cities whereof the parties plaintife are citizens, of the damages and grievances any way unjustly inflicted upon them or any of them by the English) to the end that they may there by articles conveniently declare and prove, before the Ambas-sadours, Procurators, messengers, and Commissioners of both partes, the rate and value of their saide goods : and that in so doing they may obtaine convenient, just, and reasonable restitution, for all acts unjustly attempted against them, then, or at some other times effectually to bee set downe and limited at the foresaid place by the consent of the Ambassadors and Commissioners of both parts, even as it was above promised unto the marchants of Livonia.



But if they of Prussia last above-mentioned, shall not upon the first of May, and at the place appointed, for some cause, make their appearance, that then it shalbe lawfull for them, at any time within one whole yeere next following, to repaire unto the lord Chancelor of England, at the citie of London, and to insinuate and declare unto him their complaints before exhibited unto the saide English Ambassadours in the land of Prussia, or which complaints should have bene delivered at the foresaid terme and place, or els, the which were not then and there fully finished and dispatched : and also by articles as is aforesaide, to declare and prove the true worth and estimation of all damages and grievances any wayes unjustly offered by the English unto them or any of them : to the ende that they may (as it is above mentioned) effectually receive, and also speedily and easily obtaine convenient, just, and reasonable reformation and satisfaction, for al acts unjustly attempted against them,



which are contained in the complaints not as yet fully declared and finished.



Moreover, it is appointed and agreed upon betweene the foresaide Ambassadours and Commissioners : that the forenamed sovereign Lord & the said lord the Master general are to send and set forward their Ambassadours, messengers, and Commissioners, upon the first of May unto the place appointed, to treate, parle, agree, and conclude about those affaires, which shal then and there happen to be treated of and handled among them.



Furthermore, betweene the often mentioned Ambassadours, Procurators, and Commissioners, it is enacted and concluded : that unto all and singular lawfull statutes, Note well, ordinations, and prohibitions framed, made, and ordained, by the saide lorde the Master generail, in his land of Prussia, or by his Proconsuls and Consuls, and his gover-nours of cities, townes, villages, and of other places in the land of Prussia, unto the observation whereof, aswell the subjectes of the said Master general, as foreners and strangers, are tyed and bound: unto the very same statutes, ordinations, and prohibitions, al English marchants whatsoever resorting unto the land of Prussia, must be firmely bounden and subject.



Also it is ordained, that whatsoever sale-clothes are already transported, or at any time hereafter to bee transported out of England into Prussia by the English marchants, and shall there be offered to bee solde, whether they be whole cloathes or halfe cloathes, they must containe both their endes.



Lastly, that the matters above-mentioned fall not short and voyde of their wished effect; the treaty and conference about all and singular damages and grievances (whereof there is not as yet done, but there must be, by the vertue of these presents, performed, a reformation and amendment) must be continued and proroged untill the first of May next ensuing : as by these presents they are continued and proroged with the continuation of the dayes then immediately following, at the towne of



Dordract aforesaide : at the which time and place, or at other times and places, in the meane space, as occasion shall serve, by both parties to be limited and assigned, or else within one yeere after the said first day of the moneth of May next ensuing bee expired : the hurt and damaged parties generally before-mentioned, shall have performed unto them a convenient, just, and reasonable reformation on both partes. Provided alwayes, if within the terme of the saide yeere, some convenient, just, and reasonable reformation bee not performed unto the parties injuried, and endamaged, which are generally above [I. 164.] mentioned : that then, within three whole moneths after the foresaid yere shall expired, the Prussians shall depart out of the realmes and dominions of the saide Soveraigne Lorde the king of England, together with their mar-chandize, and with other goods which they shal have gotten or bought, within the space of the foresaide three moneths: and that the English men also are likewise in all respects bounden to avoid and (no lawfull impediment hindering them) to withdrawe themselves and to depart out of the territories and dominions of the saide Master generail, without all molestation, perturbation, and impediment whatsoever, none other intimation or admonition being necessarie in this regard.



Howbeit least that by the robberies and piracies of some insolent and perverse people, matter should be ministred unto the said lord the Master general, of swarving from the faithfull observation of the foresaide agreements, or (which God forbid) any occasion bee given him of not observing them : it is also decreed by the often above mentioned Ambassadours and messengers, that if the goods and marchandize of any of the saide lorde Master general his subjectes whatsoever shall be from hencefoorth unjustly taken upon the Sea, by any English Pirates, and shalbe caried into the realme of England, and there received, that the Governours and keepers of portes, and of other places (with whatsoever names they be called) at the which portes and places



such marchandises and goods shall chaunce to arrive, beeing onely informed of the saide goods and marchandises, by sole report, or (other proofes wanting) by probable suspition are bound to arrest and to keep them in safe custodie, favourably to be restored unto the owners therof, whensoever they shall be lawfully de-maunded : which if they shall omit or deny to perrorme, from thenceforth the saide governours and keepers are bound to make unto the parties endamaged, a recompense of their losses.



And for fault of justice to be executed, by the said governours and keepers, our soveraign lord the king above named, after he shall conveniently be requested by the parties damnified, is bound within three moneths next ensuing (all lawfull impediments being excepted) to make correspondent, just, and reasonable satisfaction, unto the saide parties endamaged. Otherwise, that it shal be right lawfull for the saide lorde the Master generail, to arrest, and after the arrest to keepe in safe custodie the goods of the English marchants being in the land of Prussia, to the condigne satisfaction of such injuries, as have bene offered unto his subjects, untill his said subjects be justly and reasonably contented.



Likewise also in all respects, the same justice is to be done unto the English by the said Lord the Master general and his subjects in Prussia, even as it hath bene enacted and decreed in the above written clause, beginning, Casterum ne per &c. In English. Howbeit least that &c. for the said Master general, and his subjects by the foresaide ambassadors of England, and the commissioners of the said lord the Master generail, that in like cases justice ought to be administred on the behalfe of himselfe, and of his subjects in the realme of England.



And that all and singular the covenants above written, may in time to come, by the parties whom they concerne, firmly and inviolably be observed; the forenamed ambassadors, messengers, and commissioners, all and



every of them, for the full credite, probation, and tes-timonie of all the premisses, have unto these present Indentures, made for the same purpose, caused everie one of their seales with their owne hands to be put. One part of the which indentures remaineth in the custodie of the English ambassadors, and the other part in the hands of the commissioners of Prussia. Given at the castle of Marienburgh in Prussia, in the yeere of our Lorde 1405. upon the 8. day of the moneth of October.
