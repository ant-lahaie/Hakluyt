A briefe description of the Hand of Cyprus : by the which not onely the Venetians title why they have so long enjoyed it, but also the Turks, whereby now he claimeth it, may plainly appeare.



ESTgjlHe Hand of Cyprus is invironed with divers seas : f°r Westward it is washed with the sea called SmhShI Pamphilium : Southward, with the sea TEgyptium: on the East part, with the sea Syrium : and Northward, with the sea called Cilicium. The which Hand in time past had divers names : called once Acamantis, as Sabellicus witnesseth. Philonides maketh mention, that it was called sometime Cerasis. Xenogoras writeth, that it was named Aspelia, Amathusa, & Macaria. There were in times past fifteene cities or famous townes in it, but now very few, amongst the which Famagusta is the chiefest & strongest, situated by the sea side. There is also Nicosia, which was woont, by the traffike 124



of Marchants, to be very wealthy : besides the city of Baffo, Arnica, Saline, Limisso, Melipotamo, & Episcopia. Timosthenes affirmeth, that this Hand is in compasse 429 miles : and Arthemidorus writeth the length of the same to be 162 miles, measuring of it from the East to the West, betwixt two promontories named Dinaretta and Acamanta. This Hand is thought to be very rich, abundant of Wine, Oile, Graine, Pitch, Rozin, Allum, Salt, and of divers precious stones, pleasant, profitable, and necessary for mans use, and much frequented of Marchants of Syria, unto the which it lieth very nere. It hath bene, as Plinie writeth, joyned sometime with Syria, as Sicilia hath beene also with Italy. It was a long time subject unto the Romans, after to the Persians, and to the Soldan of ./Egypt. The selfesame Hand was sometime also English, being conquered by king Richard the first, in his voyage to Hierusalem in the yeere of our Lord 1192. Who (as Polydore writeth in his fourteenth booke of our English historic) being prohibited by the Cypriottes from arrivall there, invaded and conquered the same soone after by force: and having left behinde him sufficient garrisons to keepe the same, departed from thence to Ptolemayda : who afterward exchanged the same with Guy of Lusignan, that was the last christened king of Hierusalem, for the same kingdome. For the which cause the kings of England were long time after called kings of Hierusalem. And last of all, the Venetians have enjoyed it of late a long time, in this order following. In the yeere of our Lord 1470, John king of the sayd Hand, sonne to Janus of Lusignan, had by Helen his wife, which was of the Emperiall house of Paleologus, one daughter only called Charlotta, and a bastard called James : the which James was afterward consecrated Bishop of Nicosia. This Charlotta was married first to the king of Portingall, of whom he had no issue, so that he being dead, Lewes Duke of Savoy (to whom shee was the second time married) sonne to Lewes the second of that name (unto



125



whom the said Hand by the right of this his wife Charlotta did appertaine) had the possession of the same. James the bastard assoone as his father was dead, of a Bishop became a souldiour, and with an army wanne the Hand, making it his owne by force. This Duke of Savoy hearing these newes, with a number of well appointed souldiers, arrived shortly after in Cyprus, and recovering againe the Hand, compelled the bastard to flie foorthwith over to the Soldan of /Egypt. Who making himselfe his subject, in time so wrought and tempered the matter, that the Soldan in person at his request passed over into Cyprus, besieged Duke Lewes in the castle of Nicosia, and at length compelled him to depart, leaving his kingdome. So that this Bishop became againe King of this Hand : who shortly after cleaving to the Venetians having made a league of friendship with them, married by their consent one Catherina the daughter of Marco Cornaro, which Catherin the Senate of Venice adopted unto them soone after as their daughter. This Bishop not long after sickened, and died, leaving this his wife with child, who lived not long after his fathers death. By the which meanes the Venetians making themselves the next heires to Catherina by the law of adoption, tooke unto them the possession of this kingdome, and have kept and enjoyed the same almost this hundred yeeres. Now this great Turke called Sultan Selim in the right of the Soldan of /Egypt, whom his grandfather (called also Sultan Selim) conquered, pretendeth a right title unto it, and now, as you may understand by reading of this short Treatise, hath by conquest obtained the same. Whom I pray the everliving God, if it be his holy will, shortly to root out from thence.

Am not ignorant (gentle Reader) how hard a matter it is for any one man to write that, which should please and satisfie all persons, we being commonly of so divers opinions and contrary judgements : againe Tully affirmeth it to be a very difficult thing, to finde out any



matter which in his owne kinde may be in all respects perfect. Wherefore I trust by your owne judgement I ought of reason to be the sooner pardoned (my translation being precisely tied to mine authours meaning) if any thing heerein besides be thought to be wanting : I have learned by the way how comberous a thing it is to turne the selfesame matter out of the Italian language into our countrey speech. But who so doeth what he possibly can is bound to no more. And I now at the request of others (who put me in minde, that I was not onely borne unto my selfe) have accomplished that in the ende, which I promised and was required. With what paine and diligence, I referre me [II. i. 121.] to them which are skilfull in the Italian tongue, or may the better judge, if it please them to trie the same, casting aside this exampier. I speake it not arrogantly, I take God to witnesse: but mens painefull travels ought not lightly to be condemned : nor surely at any time are woont to be of the learned, or discreet. By whose gentle acceptation if these my present doings be now supported, I will perswade my selfe that I have reaped sufficient fruit of my travell. Unto whome with all my heart I wish prosperous successe in all their affaires.

He sixteenth day of February, * 1571, the fleet which had brought the ayde unto Famagusta, departed from thence, whereas were found in all the army, but foure thousand footmen, eight hundred of them chosen souldiers, and three thousand (accounting the Citizens and other of

souldiers of Albania. After the arrivall of the which



succour, the fortification of the City went more diligently forward of all hands, then it did before, the whole gari-son, the Grecian Citizens inhabiting the Towne, the Governours and Captaines not withdrawing themselves from any kinde of labour, for the better incouragement and good example of others, both night and day searching the watch, to the intent with more carefull heed taking they might beware of their enemies, against whom they made no sally out of the City to skirmish but very seidome, especially to understand when they might learne the intent of the enemies. Whilest we made



this diligent provision within the Citie, the Turks without made no lesse preparation of all things necessary, fit to batter the fortresse withall, as in bringing out of Caramania and Syria with all speed by the Sea, many woollpacks, a great quantitie of wood and timber, divers pieces of artillery, engins, and other things expedient for their purpose.



At the beginning of April Halli Basha landed there



with fourscore gallies or thereabout in his company, who [II. i. 122.] brought thither that, which of our enemies was desired, who soone after departing from thence, and leaving behinde him thirty gallies, which continually transported souldiours, munition, fresh victuals, and other necessaries,

besides a great number of * Caramusalins, or Brigandines, great Hulkes called * Maones, and large broad vessels termed of them * Palandrie, which continually passed to and fro betweene Cyprus and Syria, and other places thereabout, which they did with great speed, standing in feare of the Christian army. And about the middest of the same moneth the Turkes caused to be brought out of the Citie of Nicosia, which they had woone a little before, fifteene pieces of artillery, and raising their army from whence they were before, making ditches and trenches necessary, incamped themselves in gardens, and toward the West part of Famagusta neere a place called Precipola.



The five and twentieth day of the same moneth they raised up mounts to plant their artillery upon, and caused trenches to be made for harquebuzers, one very nigh another, approching still very neere the Citie, in such order, as was almost impossible to stay the same, fortie thousand of their Pioners continually labouring there the most part of all the night. The intent of the enemie being then knowen, and in what part of the Citie he minded most to plant his battery, we tooke diligent heed on the other part, to repaire and fortifie all places necessary within. For the which cause wee placed a great watch in that way, which was covered with a counter-scharfe, and in the sallies of their privy Posternes, for the defence of the said counterscharfe, there were new flanckers made, also Traverses called Butterisses made upon the Cortaine, with one trench of Turves two foot high and broad, the which was made on that side of the wall of the Citie, which was already battered with the shot of the Turkes, with certaine loope holes for our Harquebuzers, by the which they defended the counterscharfe. Two noble personages Bragadino and Baglione personally tooke this charge on them, by the which meanes the Christian affaires passed in very good order. All the bread for our Souldiers was made in one storehouse, of the which the noble gentleman Lorenzo



130



Tiepolo captaine of * Baffo had charge, who refused no paine, where he thought his travell might prevaile. In the castle was placed that famous gentleman Andrea Bragadino, who with a diligent gard had charge on that part of the castle principally, next unto the sea side, trimming and digging out new flanckers for the better defence of the *Arsenall.



A valiant knight named Foito was appointed Master of the Ordinance, who was slain within few dayes after in a skirmish, whose garrison the noble Bragadino Provedi-tore before named presently delivered over to me. Three other captaines were appointed over the wilde-fire with twentie footmen for every one of them, chosen out of the armie, to use and execute the same as occasion should serve. The best pieces of Ordinance were brought foorth unto that side of the Towne, where the battery was looked for to be made : and they made privy fences to cover the better their cannon shot withall. There was no want in the Christians to annoy their enemies in issuing often out of every side against them, aswell to hinder their determinations, as to hurt them otherwise at divers times. They also rendered to us the like. For three hundred of the inhabitants of Famagusta one time issuing out of the citie, armed onely with their swords and targets, with so many Italian Harquebuzers also in their company, received great dammage, because the trenches of the enemies were made about so thicke, although at the same present wee compelled them to flie, and slew also many of them : yet they increased to such number, that they killed presently thirty, and hurt there threescore of our company. For the which cause order was taken, that our men should no more come forth of their holde, committing themselves to manifest perill to bid their enemies the base.



The Turkes in processe of time by little and little with their trenches, came at length to the toppe of the counter-scharfe, and having furnished their forts the nineteenth day of May, began their battery with ten forts, having

threescore and foureteene pieces of great artillary within their custody, amongst the which there were foure Basiliskes (for so they terme them) of an immeasurable greatnesse, and began to batter from the gate Limisso unto the Arsenall, and layed five batteries against the towne, the one against the great high Turret of the Arsenall, which was battered with five pieces of Ordinance mounted upon that fort of the rocke, the other against the Cortaine it selfe of the Arsenall, battered by one fort with eleven pieces : another against the Keepe of Andruzzi with two commanders, or cavaliers, which were above with one fort of eleven other pieces : another battery against the Turret of S. Nappa, the which was battered with foure Basilisks. The gate of Limisso, which had one high commander or cavalier alone, and a Brey and Cortaine without was battered by the forts with three and thirty pieces of artillery, whereas Mustafa himselfe general of the Turkes army tooke the charge in person. At the first they seemed not to care much to spoile the walles, but shot still into the city, [II. i. 123.] and against our Ordinance, which greatly galled them.



Whereupon they, who were within the city, aswell our souldiours, as the Grecians, assoone as the battery began, withdrawing themselves, came and dwelt by the walles of the citie, whereas they continued from that time to the end of the siege. The noble Bragadino lodged in the Keepe of Andruzzi, Baglioni in that ward of S. Nappa. The honourable Tiepolo in that which was called Campo Santo. Wherefore they being present at all that was done, both encouraged, and punished the souldiers according to their deserts. The right worshipfull Luigi Martiningo was appointed chiefe over the Ordinance, who answering all mens expectation of him, with great courage divided the charge thereof unto sixe other inferiour captaines, who tooke order and care for that company, and for the provision of things necessary for the gunners : one company of the Grecians being appointed to every gate of the Citie for to attend upon 132



the service of the artillery. The valiant captaine Francesco Bagone warded at the Keepe, and at the great Commander of the Arsenall. Captaine Pietro Conte attended upon the Cortaine, at the Commander of the Volti, and at the Keepe of Campo Santo. I for my part attended upon the Commander of Campo Santo, and upon the Commander of Andruzzi, and of the Cortaine, unto the Turret of Santa Nappa. The Earle Hercole Martiningo attended upon the Commander of Santa Nappa, and to the whole Cortaine, unto the gate of Limisso. Horatio Captaine of Veletri attended upon the Brey and Cortaine toward the Bulwarke. Upon the high Commander of Limisso, which was more troubled then all the rest, attended the Captaine Roberto Malvezzi. At the same time, when the battery began (by the commission of the honourable Bragadino) victuals were appointed, and given to all the souldiers, aswell Grecians, as Italians, and Gunners : namely Wine, Pottage, Cheese, and Bakon : all the which things were brought to the walles as need did require in very good order, so that no souldier there spent any more in bread then two souses a day. They were payed at the end of every thirty dayes with the great travell of that right worshipfull Venetian gentleman M. Giovanni Antonio Querini, who besides this his ordinary charge was found present in all weighty and dangerous affaires to the great incouragement of our souldiours. And wee made a counterbattery against our enemies for ten dayes space, with so great rage, that we choked and destroyed fifteene of their best pieces, also we killed and dispatched of them about thirty thousand at that season, so that they were disappointed at that time of their battery in that place, and were greatly dismayed. But we foreseeing that we had no great store of powder left, there was made a restraint, and such order taken, that thirty pieces should not shoot off but thirty shot a piece every day, and that in the presence of the Captaines, who were still present, because the Souldiers and Gunners should not shoot off in vaine.



133



Two Venetian souses or Soldi amount but to one peny English.



The nine and twentieth day of May there came towards us from Candia a Fregat or Pinnace, the which giving us great hope and lightening of ayde, encreased marvellously every mans courage. The Turks with great travell and slaughter of both sides, had woonne at the last the counterscharfe from us, with great resistance and mortalitie on both parts. Whereupon they began on the other side of the fift battery to fill up the ditch, with the earth that they threw downe, which was taken neere the wall of the counterscharfe. But all that earth and falling downe of the wall made by the shot of their artillery, was caried away of us within the city, all our company labouring continually aswell by night as day, untill our enemies had made certaine loope-holes in the wall, thorow the which they flancking and scouring all the ditch with their harquebus, stopped our former course of carying, or going that way any more, without certaine and expresse danger. But M. Giovanni Marmori, a fortifier, had devised a certaine kinde of joyned boords, the which being caried of the souldiers, defended them from the shot of the Harquebuzers, so that some other quantity of earth, but no great store, was caried also away : in the which place this foresayd fortifier was slaine, who had done especiall good service in all our necessary affaires. And our enemies having cast so much earth into the ditch, as filled it up againe, and made it a firme way to the wall of the counterscharfe, and casting before them the earth by little and little, they made one traverse even unto the wall on two sides in all their batteries, the which they made thicke and strong with woolpacks, and other fagots, to assure themselves the better of our flanckers.



When they had once possessed the ditch, that they could not be hurt of us but by chance, they began foorth-with to cast and digge out undermines to undermine the Brey, the Turret of Santa Nappa, the Commander of Andruzzi, the Keepe of Campo Santo, the Cortaine, and the Turrion of the Arsenall: so that being able no



134



longer to serve our turne injoy those fewe flanckers, we threw downe wilde-fire into our enemies campe, the which annoyed them very sore, because it fired their woolpacks, & also their fagots. And for the better encouragement of the souldiers, the right honorable Bragadino gave to every souldier one duckat, ye which could gaine or recover any of the former woolpackes, [II. i. 124.] making countermines in all places. To the which charge Maggio the fortifier knight was appointed, who in all our businesse served with such diligence and courage, as he was able, or was requisite. But the countermines met not, saving those of the Commander of S. Nappa, of Andruzzi, and that of Campo Santo, because they * ^Ibanois were open, and our men sallied out often both by day souldiers, soul-and night into the ditch to perceive better the way of diers of the mines, and to fire the fagots and wooll. Nor we ceassed at any time through the unspeakable travell of caued the Lord Baglione (who had the oversight of all these who commonly matters) to trouble our enemies intents, by all maner of serve the wit and policie, dividing the companies for the batteries, Returns both joyning and planting in all places a garrison of the mdfiottVery * Albanois souldiours, who aswell on foot as on horse- skilfull y backe, shewed alwayes notable courage and manhood, painfull.



The first assault.



THe one and twentieth day of June they put fire to the mine of the Turret of the Arsenall, whereas Giambelat Bey tooke charge, who with great ruine rent in sunder a most great and thicke wall, and so opened the same, that he threw downe more then halfe thereof, breaking also one part of the vaimure, made before to upholde the assault. And suddenly a great number of the Turkes skipping upon the ruines thereof, displayed their Ensignes, even to the toppe of the same. Captaine Pietro Conte with his company was in that ward, the which was much shaken and terrified by that sudden ruine. I with my company came first thither, so that they shortly tooke the repulse, and although they re-

freshed themselves with new supplies five or sixe times, yet they failed of their purpose. There fought personally the Lord Baglione : Bragadino and Querini being armed stood not farre off to refresh and comfort our Souldiours, and the Captaine of the Castell with the Ordinance, that was planted upon the Butteries destroyed many of our enemies, when they gave ye assault, the which endured five houres together : so that of Turkes were slaine very many, and of our side betweene them that were slaine and hurt one hundred : most part of the which number were cast away by a mischance of our wilde-fire, the which being unadvisedly and negligently handled, burnt up many of our owne company. There died at that present the Earle Gio. Francesco Goro, the Captaine Barnardino Agubio : and by the throwing of stones Hercole Malatesta, Captaine Pietro Conte, with other Captaines and Standerdbearers, were very sore hurt.



The night following arrived in Cyprus a Pinnasse from Candia, which bringing newes of most certaine ayde, greatly increased both the mirth and courage of us all, so that we made soone after, with the helpe of the Captaine Marco Crivellatore, and Maggio the knight, certaine retreats flancked to all the places beaten downe, and whereas they suspected that the enemy had digged up any mines, with Hogsheads, Chests, Tikes, and Sacks stuffed full of moist earth (the Grecians with all speed having already brought almost all that which they had)> because they having dispatched their Canveis about necessary uses, they brought their hangings, cortaines, carpets, even to their very sheets, to make and stuffe up their foresayd sacks, a very good and ready way to make up againe their vaimures, the which were throwen downe with the fury of the artillery, which never stinted, so that we made up againe still that in the night, the which was throwen downe and broken in the day, sleeping very seidome : all the souldiers standing alwayes upon the walles, visited continually of the 136

It is accounted a good warlike shift, to leave that to our enemies with hinderance, which we can not any longer keepe, and use to our owne commodity.



battery to all places, and into our retreats, so that they labouring more speedily then ever they did, made seven other forts more, under the castle, and taking away the artillery from them which were farther off, planting of it somewhat neerer, to the number of fourescore, they battered the holde with so great rage, that on the eighth day of July, with the same night also were numbred five thousand Canon shot, and after that sort they overthrew to the ground the vaimures, that scarsely with great travell and paine we could repaire them againe, because our men that laboured about them were continually slaine by their Ordinance, and by reason of the endlesse tempest of the shot of their Harquebuzers. And our men beganne to decrease. For the Turkes caused us to retire from our Breyes, by the violence of their artillery and mining, in such sort, that there being no more standing left for our Souldiours, because we making our vaimures more thicke, our standing began to waxe narrower, the which presently we of necessitie enlarged with boords as a scaffolde to the vaimure, whereby we might have more elbow roome to fight. Captaine Maggio also made one mine under the said Brey, to the intent, that we being not able any longer to keepe it, the same might be left to our enemies to their great hinderance.



The third assault.



TO the said Brey the ninth day of July they gave the third assault, to the Turrion of Santa Nappa, to that of Andruzzi, to the Cortaine, to the Keepe of the Arsenall: the which assault having continued more then sixe houres, they were beaten backe in foure places, but we left the Brey to their great losse, and ours also : because we being assaulted, our company being not able to mannage their Pikes in good order, by reason of the narrownesse of the standing where they were, being willing to retire in that order, as the L. Baglione had prescribed unto them, and could not, 138



I57I-cast themselves at the last into a confuse order, and retired, they being mingled amongst the Turkes: so that fire being given to our mine, the same (with a terrible sight to beholde) slew presently of our enemies more then one thousand, and above one hundred of us. There was slaine Roberto Malvezzi, and Captaine Marchetto de Fermo was grievously wounded. At the assault of the Arsenall was slaine Captaine David Noce master of the Campe, & I my selfe was hurt by the racing of a Cannon shot. This assault continued five houres, and the Citizens of Famagusta shewed great courage in every place, with their women also, and yoong striplings. The Brey was so defaced by reason of this mine set on fire, that no body any more attempted to recover the same: because there was no apt place remaining to stay upon. The left flancker onely remained still, whereas another mine was made. The gate of Limisso was over against this foresayd Brey, and somewhat lower, which was alwayes open, having made to the same a Portali, with a Percollois annexed to it, the which Percollois by the cutting of a small cord, was a present defence to the gate, and our Souldiours gave their attendance by that gate to bring in the battered earth, which fell in the ditches from the rampaire: and when they saw that their enemies in foure dayes came not thither, they beganne to entrench above the Brey, and by the flanckers above they suffered no ™ person to passe out of the gate, the which thing at brought great suspition unto our enemies, because they dangerous were often times assailed of our company.	times not only

Who assoone as they had encouraged their Souldiours, sallying swiftly foorth, killed, and put to flight the greater part of them, and at the last giving fire to the mine of the flancker slew foure hundred Turkes, and Sig. Baglione at the same time woon an Ensigne of our enemies, wrasting it violently out of one of the Ensigne bearers hands. The day following they gave fire to the mine of the Cortaine, the which thing not [II. i. 126.] falling out greatly to their purpose, they followed not their prepared assault. Wherefore they beganne to fortifie, and advance higher their traverses in the ditches, for their better assurance against they should give the assault : and they had emptied and carried away all the earth neere unto the counterskarfe, where they lodged in their pavillions, so that we could not descrie them. They shot seven pieces of artillery upon the wall of the counterscharfe so covertly, that they were not seene: two from the Brey of the Turrion of Santa Nappa, one from Andruzzi, and two other all along the battery of the Cortaine. And they came with certaine boordes covered with rawe and green e hides, under which they brought their men to digge in the vaimures, we being nothing behinde or forgetfull to cast wilde-fire amongst them, and sometime to issue foorth of our sallies called Posternes, to offend their Pioners, although to our great hinderance. And we still repaired the vaimures by all meanes possible, with BufFe skinnes, being moist and wet, throwing in also earth, shreads, and cotton with water, being well bound together with cordes : all the women of Famagusta gathering themselves together into companies in every street (being guided of one of their Monkes called Caloiero) resorted dayly to a certaine place appointed, to labour, gathering and providing for the souldiers, stones and water, the which was kept for all assaults in halfe buts to quench the fire, which the Turks threw amongst them.

Having had no great successe in taking of the gate, they found out a newe way, never heard of before, in gathering together a great quantitie of certaine wood called Teglia, which easily burned, and smelt very evill, the which they throwing before the former gate of the Citie, and fagots fastened to the same, with certaine beames besmeered with Pitch, kindled suddenly so great a fire, as was not possible for us to quench the same, although we threw upon it whole Buts of water, which were throwen downe from an high Commander, which Buts presently brake in sunder.



This fire continued foure dayes, wherefore we were inforced by reason of the extreame heat and stinch, to withdraw our selves further inward, and they descending towardes their lower flanckers, beganne other mines, so that the gate was shut up, because it could be no longer kept open, and suddenly (a thing marvellous to be spoken) the standing of the Brey being repaired, and made up againe, they planted one piece over against the gate, the which of us with stones, earth and other things, was suddenly buried up. By this time we were driven to an exigent, all our provision within the Citie stooping very lowe, saving onely hope, the noble courage of the Governours and Captaines, and the stout readinesse of the Souldiours: our wine, and flesh as well forsaketh. powdered as unpowdered was spent, nor there was any Saguntina Cheese to be gotten, but upon an unreasonable price, our fames. company having eaten up their Horses, Asses, and Cats, for lacke of other victualis: there was nothing left to

THe enemies travelled much to become masters of those foresayd flankers, and to sally foorth by the other batteries, and this assault lasted from three of the clocke in the after noone until night, where, and at what time were slaine very many of our enemies. In this assault Sig. Giacomo Strambali, amongst the rest, shewed much worthinesse, as hee had done before in other conflictes.



The sixt and last assault.



THe next morning following, at the breake of the day, they assailed all places, the which assault continued more then sixe houres, with very little hurt on our side, because our enemies fought more coldly then they were wont to doe, annoying of us continually on the Sea side with their Gallies, shooting in all their assaults and batteries continually Cannon shot in all parts of the Citie, as neere as they might. After we Necessitie oft had defended and repulsed this assault, and perceived timetyesseth things brought to a narrower straite then they were that, whick wont to be at, wee having left in all the whole Citie our will cm-but seven barrels of pouder, the governours of the tinually Citie fully determined to yeelde up themselves and the sPurneth Citie, with honourable conditions. Wherefore the first aSamst" of August in the after noone, they tooke a truce, one

being come for that purpose from Mustafa the general, with whom they concluded the next morning following to give two hostages a piece, untill such time as both armies were agreed. For our hostages (by the appointment of the right honourable Bragadino) were sent foorth the earle Hercole Martinengo, and Signior Matteo Colsi a Citizen of Famagusta, and from our enemies came into the Citie the Lieutenant of Mustafa, Giannezeribe and the Aga of the Giannizzers, the which were met, ^e^Tw-ke6 even unto ^e gate	Citie, of Signiour Baglione

All the which dealing, to requests and articles were agreed upon, granted, and speakeandnot subscribed unto by the hand of Mustafa. Foorthwith dainly to pro- were sent Gallies, and other vessels into the haven, so mise, and that our souldiers immediatly began to imbarke them-never to per- selves, of the which the greater part were already gone firm the same. aboorde, the Nobilitie and our chiefe Captaines also being likewise very desirous to depart.



The 15. of August in the morning, the worthy Bragadino sent me with a letter unto Mustafa, by the which hee signified, that the same night hee would come unto him to deliver up the keyes of the Citie, and that he would leave in the holde the honourable gentleman Tiepolo, praying him therefore, that whilest hee should have just cause thus to bee abroad, that there might be



144



no harme done at home, and in the Citie. The Turkes from our truce taking untill that time, practised with us all familiarly, and without any suspition of sinister or double dealing, they having shewed us much courtesie both in word and deede. Mustafa himselfe by worde of mouth presently answered me to this letter, in this sort, that I should returne, and make relation to this noble man Bragadino, who had sent mee, that he should come over to him at his owne pleasure, for hee was very desirous both to see and know him, for his great worthi-nesse and prowesse, that hee had tried to be in him, and in the other of his Captaines and Souldiers, of whose manhood and courage he would honourably report, where soever he came, as occasion should serve thereunto: and to conclude, that hee should nothing doubt of any thing: because in no maner of condition hee would suffer any [II. i. 128.] violence to be done to those, which remained behind within the Citie. So I speedily returning made true report of the same: and towards night about foure of the clocke, the right honourable Bragadino accompanied with the L. Baglione, with Signior Aluigi Martinengo, with the right worshipfull Signior Gio. Antonio Querini, with the right worshipfull Signior Andrea Bragadino, with the knight of Haste, with the captaine Carlo Ragonasco, with captaine Francesco Straco, with captaine Hector of Brescia, with captaine Girolomo di Sacile, and with other gentlemen and fiftie souldiours, the Governours and Noble men with their swordes, and the souldiours with their harquebuzes came foorth of their hold, and went unto the pavillion of Mustafa, of whom, all they at the beginning were curteously received, and caused to sit downe by him, he reasoning and discoursing with them of divers things, a certaine time, and drawing them from one matter to another, at the last upon a sudden picked a quarell unto them, especially burdening that noble Bragadino with an untrueth, laying to his charge y‘ he had caused certaine of his slaves in the time that the truce continued betweene them, to be put to death.

which thing was most false. So that hee being angry therewith, suddenly stept foorth, and commaunded them to bee bound. Thus they being unarmed (not suffered at that time to enter into his pavillion, with their former weapons) and bound, were led one by one into the market place, before his pavillion, being presently cut and hewen in sunder in his presence, and last of all from that woorthy and noble Bragadino (who being bound as the rest, and being commaunded twise or thrise to stretch foorth his necke, as though hee should have bene beheaded, the which most boldly hee did without any sparke of feare) his eares were cut off, and causing him to bee stretched out most vilely upon the ground, Mustafa talked with him, and blasphemed the holy name of our Saviour, demaunding him, where is now thy Christ, that hee helpeth thee not ? To all the which no answere at all was given of that honourable gendeman. The earle Hercole Martinengo, which was sent for one of the hostages, who was also bound, was hidden by one of Mustafas eunuches untill such time as his furie was past, afterward his life being graunted him, hee was made the eunuches slave. Three Grecians which were under his pavillion were left untouched. All the souldiers which were found in the campe, and all sortes of Christians to the number of three hundred, were suddenly slaine, they nothing mistrusting any such treason, or tirannie. The Christian souldiers which were embarked a Iide before, were linked and fettered with iron chaines, made slaves, all things being taken from them, and stripped into their shirtes.



The second day after this murther was committed, which was the 17. of August, Mustafa entred the first time into the Citie, and caused the valiant and wise governour Tiepolo to bee hanged, who remained behind, waiting the returne of Signior Bragadino. I being in the citie at that present, when other of my countreymen were thus miserably slaine and made slaves, hid my selfe in certaine of the Grecians houses the space of five dayes, 146



and they not being able to keepe mee in covert any longer for feare of the great penaltie, which was proclaimed agaynst such transgressors and concealers, I ofired, and gave my selfe slave to one Sangiaccho del Bir, promising him five hundred *Zechins for my ran- * T.echini, be some, with whom I remained in the Campe. The Friday folowing (being the Turkes sabboth day) this woorthy coined in Ve-and pacient gentleman Bragadino was led still in the nice, every one presence of that unfaithfull tirant Mustafa, to the of the which is batteries made unto the Ci tie, whereas he being compelled to cary two baskets of earth, the one upon his ^nce^tf^ur ? backe, the other in his hand slave-like, to every sundry many, iAsome-battrie, being enforced also to kisse the ground as oft as what better .• he passed by him, was afterward brought unto the sea side, where he being placed in a chaire to leane and stay upon, was winched up in that chaire, and fastened unto Byraltom. the maineyard of a galley, and hoisted up with a crane, to shew him to all the Christian souldiours and slaves



(which were in the haven already shipped) hee being afterward let downe, and brought to the market place, the tormenters tooke of his clothes from him, and tacked him unto the pillorie, whereas he was most cruelly flaied quicke ; with so great constancie and faith on his part, that he never lost or abated any jot of his stedfast courage, being so farre from any fainting, that hee at that present with most stout heart reproched them, and spake much shame of his most traiterous dealing in breaking of his faithfull promise. At the last without any kind of alteration of his constancie, he recommending his soule unto almightie God, gave up the ghost. When hee had thus ended his life (thanks be to God) his skin being taken and filled with strawe, was commaunded foorthwith to be hanged upon the bowsprit of a *Foist, and to be caried alongst the coast of Syria by the sea side, that all the port townes might see, and understand who he was.

whilest that I was in the Fortresse : that also which by true relation of others I could understand, and sawe also my selfe in the campe, whilest I was slave, I will likewise briefly utter unto you. The enemies armie was in num-[II. i. 129.] ber two hundred thousand persons of all sortes and qualities. Of souldiers which tooke pay there were 80. thousand, besides the which number, there were 14. thousand of Giannizzers taken out from all the holdes of Syria, Caramania, Natolia, and part of them also which * The gate of came from the *gate of the great Turke. The venturers ^Isas th6 sword were 60. thousand in number. The much to say reason, why there were so many of this sort, was because as Constantin- Mustafa had dispersed a rumour through the Turkes dominion, that Famagusta was much more wealthy and rich, then the citie of Nicosia was : so for that cause, and by the commodious and easie passage from Syria over into Cyprus, these venturers were easily induced to come thither. In 75. dayes (all the which time the batterie



GliVenturieri still continued) 140. thousand iron pellets were shot of, numbred, and seene. The chiefe personages which were in their armie neere unto Mustafa, were these following : the Bassa of Aleppo, the Bassa of Natolia, Musafer Bassa of Nicosia, the Bassa of Caramania, the Aga of the Giannizzers, Giambelat * Bey, the Sangiaccho of Tripolis, the *Begliarbei of Greece, the Bassa of Scivassi and of Marasco, Ferca Framburaro, the * Sangiaccho of Antipo, Soliman Bey, three Sangiacchos of Arabia, Mustafa Bey generail of the Venturers, Fergat gover-nour of Malathia, the Framburaro of Diverie, the Sangiaccho of Arabia and other Sangiacchos of lesser credite, with the number of fourescore thousand persons besides, as by the muster made by his Commission might well appeare.



The Framburaro which was at Rhodes, was appointed and left governour at Famagusta, and the report was that there should bee left in all the Island of Cyprus, twentie thousand persons, with two thousand horses, many of the which I saw, being very leane and evill appoynted for 148

It seemeth also a thing not impertinent to the * Begliarbei matter, to signifie to you, how I, by the especiall grace of dgftfiethlord God, was delivered out of their cruel hands, I having # g^'accho paied within two & fortie dayes (all the which time I was -u that^erson slave) five hundred Zechins for my ransome to him, w* the whose prisoner I was, by the meanes of the Consul for Turkes, that the French merchants, a ligier then at Tripolis, who a &vernetha litle before came from Tripolis in Syria unto Cyprus, into ^ountrey^ the Turkes campe.
