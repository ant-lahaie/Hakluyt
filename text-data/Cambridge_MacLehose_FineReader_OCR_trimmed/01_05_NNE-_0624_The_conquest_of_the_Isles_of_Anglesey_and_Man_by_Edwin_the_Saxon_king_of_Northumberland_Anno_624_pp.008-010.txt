The conquest of the Isles of Anglesey and Man by Edwin the Saxon king of Northumberland written in the second Booke and fift Chapter of Beda his Ecclesiasticall historic of the English nation.



Duinus Nordanhumbrorum gentis, id est, ejus quae ad borealem Humbri fluminis plagam inhabitat, ----- majore potentia cunctis qui Britanniam incolunt, Anglorum pariter & Britonum populis praefuit, praeter Cantuarios tantiim, necndn & Menavias Britonum insulas, quae inter Hiberniam & Britanniam sitae sunt, Anglorum subjecit potestati.



The same in English.



EDwin king of the people of Northumberland, that is to say, of them which inhabit to the North of the river Humber, being of greater authoritie then any other potentate in the whole Isle of Britaine, bare rule as well over the English as the British nation, except onely the people of Kent: who also brought in subjection under the English, the Isles of Man and Anglesey, and the other Northwesterne Isles of the Britons, which are situate betweene Britaine and Ireland.



Another testimonie alledged by Beda to the same purpose. Lib. 2. cap. 9.



ANno ab incarnatione Domini sexcentesimo vicesimo quarto, gens Nordanhumbrorum, hoc est, ea natio Anglorum quae ad aquilonarem Humbri fluminis plagam habitat, cum rege suo Eduino, verbum fidei (praedicante



Paulino, cujus supra meminimus) suscepit: cui videlicet regi in auspicium suscipiendae fidei, & regni coelestis potestas,. & terreni creverat imperii : ita ut (quod nemo Anglorum ante eum fecit) omnes Britanniae fines, qua vel ipsorum vel Britonum Provinciae habitabantur, sub ditione acceperit. Quin & Menavias insulas (sicut & supra docuimus) imperio subjugavit Anglorum. Quarum prior quae ad austrum est, & situ amplior, & frugum proventu atque ubertate foelicior, nongentarum sexaginta familiarum mensuram, juxta aestimationem Anglorum, secunda trecentarum & ultra spatium tenet.



The same in English.	[I- 4 ]



IN the yeere from the incarnation of our Lord, sixe hundreth twentie and foure, the people of Northumberland, to wit, those English people which inhabit on the North side of the river of Humber, together with their king Edwin, at the Christian preaching and per-swasion of Paulinus above mentioned, embraced the Gospel. Under which king, after he had once accepted of the Christian faith, the power both of the heavenly & of his earthly kingdome was inlarged ; insomuch, that he (which no English king had done before him) brought under his subjection all the provinces of Britaine, which were inhabited either by the English men themselves, or by the Britons. Moreover, he subdued unto the crowne of England (as we have above signified) the Hebrides, commonly called the Westerne Islands. The principali wherof being more commodiously and pleasantly seated towards the South, and more abounding with corne then the rest, conteineth according to the estimation of the



English, roome enough for 960. families, and the second for 300. and above.
