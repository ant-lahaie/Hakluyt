The Turkes passeport or safeconduct for Captaine Austell, and Jacomo Manuchio.



Now thou which art Voyvoda of Bog-dania, & Valachia, & other our officers abiding and dwelling on the way by which men commonly passe into Bog-dania, and Valachia, that the Embassador of England having two English gentlemen desirous to depart for England,



the one named Henry Austel, and the other Jacomo de Manuchio, requested our highnesse letters of Safeconduct to passe through our dominions with one servant to attende on them. Wherefore wee straightly .charge you and all other our servants by whom they shall passe, that having received this our commande-ment, you have diligent care and regard that they may have provided for them in this their journey (for their money) all such necessary provision as shalbe necessary for themselves and their horses, in such sort as they may have no cause hereafter to complaine of you. And if by chaunce they come unto any place, where they shal stand in feare either of their persons or goods, that then you carefully cause them to bee guarded with your men, and to be conducted through all suspected places, with sufficient company ; But have great regard that they convey not out of our countrey any of our serviceable horses. Obey our commandement, and give credite to this our Seale.
