Carolo Calvo, & postea Ludovico Balbo acceptus, Dionysii Areopagitse libros de coelesti Hierarchia, ex Constantino-poli tunc missos Latinos fecit, Anno Dom. 858. Profectus postea in Britanniam, Alphredi Anglorum Regis, & suorum liberorum factus est praeceptor, atque ipso mox adhortante, inter ocia literaria & Graeco transtulit in tres linguas, scilicet Chaldaicam, Arabicam, & Latinam, Aristotelis moralia, de secretis secretorum, seu recto regimine Principum, opus certe exquisitum.
