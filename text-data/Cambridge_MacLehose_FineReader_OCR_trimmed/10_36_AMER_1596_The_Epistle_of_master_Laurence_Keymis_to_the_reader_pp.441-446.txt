A Relation of the second Voyage to Guiana, performed and written in the yeere 1596. by Laurence Keymis Gent.



To the approved, Right Valorous, and worthy Knight, Sir Walter Ralegh, Lord warden of the Stanneries, Captaine of her Majesties Guard, and her Highnesse Lieutenant generail of the Countie of Cornewall.



Have here briefly set downe the effect of this your second Discoverie without any enlargement of made wordes: for in this argument, single speech best beseemeth a simple trueth. Where the affinitie of the matter with your person, leadeth mee to write of your selfe, unto your selfe,



that small libertie which I have therein used, shall, I doubt not, without offence or sinister construction, be given to the cause in hand: which, whether it suffer not detriment, by attributing lesse then of right be-longeth; the judgement bee theirs, that uprightly and indifferently shall weigh the consequents of their evill purpose, who in seeking to detract from the Author of these Discoveries, doe so much as in them lieth, wound, deface, & tread under foot the thing it selfe. But this is no novelty, nor proper only to these our dayes. For long since it hath bin said, Laudes eo usque sunt Pericles. tolerabiles, donec ea dicuntur, quse auditores se quoque



441



facere posse existimant: simajora proferantur, invident, non credunt. The fervent zeale & loyalty of your minde in labour with this birth of so honorable expectation, as it hath deserved a recompence farre different, so needeth it not my poore suffrage to endeare the {III. 667.] toyle, care, and danger that you have willingly undergone for the good and advancement of our weale pub-lique. The praise-worthinesse thereof doeth approve it selfe, and is better read in your living doings, then in my dead unregarded papers. All that I can wish, is that my life were a sufficient pledge, to justifie, how much more easie, and more materiali, the course for Guiana would bee then others, which requiring greater charge, yeelde not so large benefit, and are subject to more doubtfull events. If unto their wisdomes who sit in place and authority, it shall appeare otherwise, and that in following of other attempts there is lesse diffi-cultie, certainer profit, and needfuller offence unto the enemie: the cost and travaile which you have bestowed, shall not, I hope, be altogether lost, if unto your Honour I can prove how, and where the amends is to be had, maugre the force and prevention of all Spaniards.



Your Lordships to be commanded in all service, Laurence Keymis.



To the Favourers of the Voyage for Guiana.



N things earnestly desired, though never so likely, we are still suspicious : thinking it more credite to our common wisedome, to discredite most noble and profitable indevours with distrust, then touch to our valours and safeties, to lie wilfully idle. So that howsoever an



action well and judicially attempted, bee esteemed halfe performed ; yet is this my jealous conceite concerning Guiana, that nothing is begun, before all be ended. In this regarde (gentle Reader) I have presumed to burthen thine eares with the weake plea of a good 442



cause, and in stead of opening it throughly to thy prudent consideration, to note only mine owne unsatisfied affection : hoping that because I doe name Guiana unto thee, thou wilt vouchsafe hoc nomine, to vaile and cover all other my defects in the desert of a good meaning. In publishing this Treatise, my labor principally tendeth to this end; to remove all fig-leaves from our unbeliefe, that either it may have cause to shake off the colourable pretences of ignorance : or if we will not be perswaded; that our selfe-will may rest inexcusable. They that shall apply, and construe this my doing, to serve the Spaniard his turne so well as our owne; in so much as it may seeme to instruct, warne, and arme him : for their satisfaction herein, they must not be ignorant, that his eyes, in seeing our shipping there, doe as effectually informe him, that many of our hearts are toward that place, as if it should be credibly advertised by some corrupt hireling, that we thinke, write, and discourse of nothing els. Neither can I imagine, that to conceale our knowledge herein (which to conceale may perhaps prove, 8c be hereafter taken for worse then paricide) would be of better purpose, then to hood winke our selves, as who would say, No man shall see us. Besides, if the action were wholy to bee effected at her Majesties charge; then might it at her Highnesse pleasure be shadowed with some other drift, and never be discovered, untill it were acted. But since it craveth the approbation and purses of many Adventurers, who cannot be so prodigall both of their possessions and lives, as voluntarily to run themselves out of breath, in pursuing they know not what: great reason it is, that where assistance is to be asked, due causes be yeelded to perswade 8c induce them unto it. The Spaniard is not so simple, unsetled, 8c uncertaine in his determinations, as to build them on our breath, or to make our papers his Bulwarks; nor so slow as to expect a precedent of our forwardnes. His proceedings are suffi-



443



ciently strengthened with the travailes, reports, & substantial proofes of his own men, that have above 60. yeres beaten round about this bush. And to say a trueth, the expedition that he hath used in sending so many ships in February last to people this country, & disappoint us; as it doth consequently shew, that he findeth his chiefest force and sinewes to consist in golde: so doeth he thereby plainly to our faces exprobrate our remisnesse & long deliberations, that in 12. moneths space have done, or sought to doe nothing worthy the ancient fame & reputation of our English In June 1^6. nation, interessed in so weighty businesse. *His late provision of a new supply of whole families to the number of 600. persons, bound for Guiana, but that it pleased God, that by meanes of that right honourable service most resolutely performed in the sea-fight, and sacking of Cadiz, the ships wherein they should have bin conveyed, were converted into ashes : what might it signifie ? Certes, as it doth evidently prove, that El Dorado hath undoubted credit & account in their judgements : so pointeth it at us, whilst we only to entertain idle time, sit listening for Guiana newes, & instantly forget it, as if it were nought els, but a pleasing [III. 668.] dreame of a golden fancy. If we with our selves shall expostulate, how this commeth to passe, that the advantage wholy resting on our side, in respect that Berreo was this last yere beaten out, the countrey throughly discovered, & the Inhabitants made desirous of her sacred Majesties happy government; they notwithstanding by entring before us, have now gotten ye start of us : what may we thinke ? Shal wee judge that their native countrey is lesse deare, or more wearisome unto them, then ours is unto us ? Their Peruleri, who going bare & empty out of Spaine, do againe within 3. or 4. yeres returne from Peru, rich and in good estate, doe apparently disprove all such conceits of them. Shall wee say that they have more spare men to be imployed in such actions ? It is no secret to



444



know the contrary. Are they subject to penury ? In all parts of Christendom, where money is not scant, all other things are plentifull. Or is their land not able to sustain their numbers of people ? They buy many slaves to follow their husbandry, & themselves disdaining base idlenes & beggery, do all honour military profession, highly esteeming it in their mercenaries and strangers. Is it then want of ability, in those that are willing, lacke of incouragement, or default of speedy order and direction for those that doe voluntarily offer themselves, their substance, & best indevour to further this cause; that maketh us to be thus coated of the Spaniard ? The first is no question. The later needeth no answere. The profit then by their example to be gathered, is, not to loose opportunitie by delay, or to seeme feareful and dismayed, where there is no cause of doubt. For as yet their post-haste doeth no way prejudice our advised leisure in setting forward, since their preparations of Negros to worke in the mynes, their horses, cattell, and other necessaries may (by the favour of God) at our first comming, both store us with quantities of gold oare, and ease us of much trouble, paines, and travaile. If we should suppose our selves now to live in the dayes of King Henry the seventh of famous memory, and the strange report of a West Indies, or new world abounding with great treasure should entice us to beleeve it: perhaps it might be imputed for some blame to the gravity of wise men, lightly to bee carried with the perswasion and hope of a new found Utopia, by such a one as Columbus was, being an alien, and many wayes subject to suspition. But since the penance of that incredulity lieth even now heavy on our shoulders ; the example forethreatning, I know not what repentance : and that we have the personal triall of so honourable and sufficient a Reporter, our own Countriman : let it be farre from us to condemne our selves in that, which so worthily we reprove in our predecessors; and to let our idle



445



knowledge content it selfe with naked contemplation, like a barren wombe in a Monastery. We cannot denie that the chiefe commendation of vertue doth consist in action: we truely say, that Otium is animae vivae sepultura: we beleeve, that perfect wisedome in this mobility of all humaine affaires, refuseth not with any price to purchase safetie : and we justly do acknowledge that the Castilians from bare legged mountainers have atteined to their greatnesse by labour & industrie* To sleepe then, because it costeth nothing ; to imbrace the present time, because it flattereth us with deceitfull contentment; and to kisse security, saying, What evill happeneth unto us ? is the plaine high way to a fearefull downfall: from which the Lord in his mercy deliver us, and give us an understanding heart, in time to see, and to seeke that, which belongeth unto our peace.
