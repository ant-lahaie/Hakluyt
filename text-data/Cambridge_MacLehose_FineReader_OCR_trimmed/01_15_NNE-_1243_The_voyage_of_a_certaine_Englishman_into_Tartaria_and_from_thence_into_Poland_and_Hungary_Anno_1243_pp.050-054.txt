Part of an Epistle written by one Yvo of Narbona unto the Archbishop of Bordeaux, conteining the confession of an Englishman as touching the barbarous demeanour of the Tartars, which had lived long among them, and was drawen along perforce with them in their expedition against Hungarie : Recorded by Mathew Paris in the yere of our Lord 1243.



THe Lord therefore being provoked to indignation, by reason of this and other sinnes committed among us Christians, is become, as it were, a destroying enemie, and a dreadfull avenger. This I may justly affirme to be true, because an huge nation, and a barbarous and inhumane people, whose law is lawlesse, whose wrath is furious, even the rod of Gods anger, overrunneth, and utterly wasteth infinite countreyes, cruelly abolishing all things where they come, with fire and sword. And this present Summer, the foresayd nation, being called Tartars, departing out of Hungarie, which they had surprised by treason, layd siege unto the || Neust.it. very same II towne, wherein I my selfe abode, with many thousands of souldiers: neither were there in the sayd 5Â°



towne on our part above 50. men of warre, whom, together with 20. crosbowes, the captaine had left in garrison. All these, out of certeine high places, beholding the enemies vaste armie, and abhorring the beastly crueltie of Antichrist his complices, signified foorthwith unto their governour, the hideous lamentations of his Christian subjects, who suddenly being surprised in all the province adjoyning, without any difference or respect of condition, fortune, sexe, or age, were by manifolde cruelties, all of them destroyed : with whose carkeises, the Tartarian chieftains, and their brutish and savage followers, glutting themselves, as with delicious cates, left nothing for vultures but the bare bones. And a strange thing it is to consider, that the greedie and ravenous vultures disdeined to praye upon any of the reliques, which remained. Oide, and deformed women they gave, as it were, for dayly sustenance, unto their Canibals : the beautifull devoured they not, but smothered them lamenting and scritching, with forced and unnaturall ravishments. Like barbarous miscreants, they quelled virgins unto death, and cutting ofF their tender paps to present for deinties unto their magistrates, they engorged themselves with their bodies.



Howbeit, their spials in the meane time discrying from the top of an high mountaine the Duke of Austria, the King of Bohemia, the Patriarch of Aquileia, the Duke of Carinthia, and (as some report) the Earle of Baden, with a mightie power, and in battell aray, approching towards them, that accursed crew immediatly vanished, and all those Tartarian vagabonds retired themselves into the distressed and vanquished land of Hungarie; who as they came suddenly, so they departed also on the sudden : which their celeritie caused all men to stand in horrour and astonishment of them. But of the sayd fugitives, the prince of Dalmatia tooke eight: one of which number the Duke of Austria knew to be an English man, who was perpetually banished out of the Realme of England, in regard of certaine notorious crimes by him committed. This fellow, on the behalfe of the most tyrannicall king of

the Tartars, had bene twise, as a messenger and interpreter, with the king of Hungarie, menacing and plainely foretelling those mischiefes which afterward happened, unlesse he would submit himselfe and his kingdome unto the Tartars yoke. Well, being allured by our Princes to confesse the trueth, he made such oathes and protestations, as (I thinke) the devill himselfe would have beene trusted for. First therefore he reported of himselfe, that presently after the time of his banishment, namely about the 30. yere of his age, having lost all that he had in the citie of Aeon at dice, even in the midst of Winter, being compelled by ignominious hunger, wearing nothing about him but a shirt of sacke, a paire of shooes, and a haire cappe onely, being shaven like a foole, and uttering an uncoth noise as if he had bene dumbe, he tooke his journey, and so travelling many countreyes, and finding in divers places friendly enterteinment, he prolonged his life in this maner for a season, albeit every day by rashnesse of speech, and inconstancie of heart, he endangered himselfe to the devill. At length, by reason of extreame travaile, and continuall change of aire and of meats in Caldea, he fell into a grievous sickenesse, insomuch that he was wearie of his life. Not being able therefore to go forward or backeward, and staying there a while to refresh himselfe, he began (being somewhat learned) to commend to writing those wordes which hee heard spoken, and within a short space, so aptly to pronounce, and to utter them himselfe, that he was reputed for a native member of that countrey: and by the same dexteritie he attained to manie languages. This man the Tartars having intelligence of by their spies, drew him perforce into their societie : and being admonished by an oracle or vision, to challenge dominion over [I. 21.] the whole earth, they allured him by many rewards to



their faithfull service, by reason that they wanted Interpreters. But concerning their maners and superstitions, of the disposition and stature of their bodies, of their countrey and maner of fighting &c, he protested the particulars following to be true : namely, that they were 52



above all men, covetous, hasty, deceitfull, and mercilesse : notwithstanding, by reason of the rigour and extremitie of punishments to be inflicted upon them by their superiours, they are restreined from brawlings, and from mutuall strife and contention. The ancient founders and fathers of their tribes, they call by the name of gods, and at certaine set times they doe celebrate solemne feasts unto them, many of them being particular, & but foure onely general. They thinke that all things are created for themselves alone. They esteeme it none offence to exercise cruelty against rebels. They be hardie and strong in the breast, leane and pale-faced, rough and huf-shouldred, having flatte and short noses, long and sharpe chinnes, their upper jawes are low and declining, their teeth long and thinne, their eye-browes extending from their foreheads downe to their noses, their eies inconstant and blacke, their countenances writhen and terrible, their extreame joynts strong with bones and sinewes, having thicke and great thighes, and short legs, and yet being equall unto us in stature: for that length which is wanting in their legs, is supplied in the upper parts of their bodies. Their countrey in olde time was a land utterly desert and waste, situated far beyond Chaldea, from whence they have expelled Lions, Beares, & such like untamed beasts, with their bowes, and other engines. Of the hides of beasts being tanned, they use to shape for themselves light, but yet impenetrable armour. They ride fast bound unto their horses, which are not very great in stature, but exceedingly strong, and mainteined with little provender. They use to fight constantly and valiantly with javelins, maces, battle-axes, and swords. But specially they are excellent archers, and cunning warriers with their bowes. Their backs are slightly armed, that they may not flee. They withdraw not themselves from the combate, till they see the chiefe Standerd of their general give backe. Vanquished, they aske no favour, and vanquishing, they shew no compassion. They all persist in their purpose of subduing the whole world under their owne subjection, as



if they were but one man, and yet they are moe then millions in number. They have 60000. Courriers, who being sent before upon light horses to prepare a place for the armie to incampe in, will in the space of one night gallop three dayes journey. And suddenly diffusing themselves over an whole province, and surprising all the people thereof unarmed, unprovided, dispersed, they make such horrible slaughters, that the king or prince of the land invaded, cannot finde people sufficient to wage battell against them, and to withstand them. They delude all people and princes of regions in time of peace, pretending that for a cause, which indeed is no cause. Sometimes they say, that they will make a voyage to Colen, to fetch home the three wise kings into their owne countrey; sometimes to punish the avarice and pride of the Romans, who oppressed them in times past; sometimes to conquere barbarous and Northren nations ; sometimes to moderate the furie of the Germans with their owne meeke mildnesse; sometimes to learne warlike feats and stratagems of the French; sometimes for the finding out of fertile ground to suffice their huge multitudes ; sometimes againe in derision they say, that they intend to goe on pilgrimage to S. James of Galicia. In regard of which sleights and collusions certaine undiscreet governors concluding a league with them, have granted them free passage thorow their territories, which leagues notwithstanding being violated, were an occasion of ruine and destruction unto the foresayd governours &c.
