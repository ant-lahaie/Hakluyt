The travailes of Ranulph Glanvile earle of Chester.



Anulphus Glanvile Cestriae Comes, vir nobilissimi generis, & utroque jure eruditus, in albo illustrium virorum a me merito ponendus venit. Ita probe omnes adolescendae suae annos legibus tum humanis tum divinis consecravit, ut non prius in hominem per aetatem evaserit, quam



nomen decusque ab insigni eruditione sibi comparaverit. Cum profecti essent Francorum Heroes Ptolemaidem, inito cum Joanne Brenno Hierosolymorum rege concilio, Damiatam TEgypti urbem obsidendam constituebant, anno salutis humanae 1218. Misit illuc Henricus rex, ab Honorio 3 Rom. Pontifice rogatus, cum magna armatorum manu Ranulphum, ad rem Christianam juvandam. Cujus virtus, Polydoro teste, in eo bello miris omnium laudibus celebrata fuit. Quo confecto negotio, Ranulphus in patriam reversus, scripsit, De legibus Angliae librum unum. Fertur praeterea, & alia quaedam scripsisse, sed tempus edax rerum, ea nobis abstulit. Claruit anno a Servatoris nostri nativitate 1230 confectus senio, dum Henricus tertius sub Antichristi tyrannide in Anglia regnaret.

RAnulph Glanvile earle of Chester, a man of a very noble house, and learned in both the Lawes, deserves of duetie to be here placed by me in the catalogue of woorthy and notable men. He applied so well all the yeeres of his youth to the study of humane and divine Lawes, that he came not so soone to the age of a man, [II. i. 33.] as he had purchased to himselfe by reason of his singular learning, renowme and honour. When the noble men of France went to Ptolomais, upon the counsell of John Brenne king of Jerusalem, they resolved to besiege 35Â°



Damiata a city of Egypt, in the yeere 1218. And then Henry the king upon the motion of Honorius the third, bishop of Rome, sent thither this earle Ranulph with a great power of armed souldiers, to further the enterprise of the Christians : whose valure in that warre (by the testimonie of Polidor Virgil) was marveilously commended of all men. After the end of which businesse, he being returned into his countrey, wrote a booke of the lawes of England. It is also reported that he wrote other books, but time the destroyer of many memorials, hath taken them from us. He flourished in the yeere after the nativity of Christ 1230, being very aged, and in the reigne of K. Henry the third.
