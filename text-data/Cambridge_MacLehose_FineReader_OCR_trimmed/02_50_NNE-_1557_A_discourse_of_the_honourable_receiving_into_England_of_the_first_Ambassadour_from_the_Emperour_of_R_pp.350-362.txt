to be made and continued betweene their majesties & subjects respectively, for the commoditie and benefit of both the realmes and people : which Orator was the 20. day of July imbarked and shipped in, and upon a good English ship named the Edward Bonaventure, belonging to the Governor, Consuls and company of English marchants, Richard Chancelor being grand Pilot, and John Buckland master of the said ship. In which was laden at the adventure of the foresaid Ambassador, and marchants at severall accounts, goods & merchandizes, viz. in waxe, trane oyle, tallow, furres, felts, yarne and such like, to the summe of 2oooo.li. sterling, together with 16. Russies attendant upon the person of the said Ambassador. Over and above ten Toure ships. other Russies shipped within the said Bay of S. Nicholas, in one other good ship to the said company also belonging called the Bona Speranza, with goods of the said Orators & marchants to the value of 6000. lib. sterling, as by the invoises and letters of lading of the said several ships (wherunto relation is to be had) particularly appeareth.



Which good ships comming in good order into the seas, & traversing the same in their journey towards the coast of England, were by contrary windes and extreme tempests of weather severed the one from the other, that is to say, the saide Bona Speranza with two other English ships also appertaining to the saide company, the one sirnamed the Philip and Mary, the other the Confidentia, were driven on the coast of Norway, into Drenton water, where the saide Confidentia was seene to perish on a Rocke, and the other, videlicet, the Bona Speranza, with her whole company, being to the number of foure and twentie persons seemed to winter there, whereof no certaintie at this present day is knowen. The third, videlicet, the Philip and Mary arrived in the Thames nigh London the eighteenth day of April, in the yeere of our Lord one thousand five hundred fiftie and seven.

THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



of our Lorde one thousand five hundred, fiftie and sixe, arrived within the Scottish coast in a Bay named Pettis-lego, where by outragious tempests, and extreme stormes, the said ship being beaten from her ground tackles, was driven upon the rockes on shore, where she brake and split in pieces in such sort, as the grand Pilot using all carefulnesse for the safetie of the bodie of the sayde Am-bassadour and his trayne, taking the boat of the said ship, trusting to attaine the shore, and so to save and preserve the bodie, and seven of the companie or attendants of the saide Ambassadour, the same boat by rigorous waves of the seas, was by darke night overwhelmed and drowned, wherein perished not only the bodie of the said grand Pilot, with seven Russes, but also divers of the Mariners of the sayd ship: the noble personage of the saide Ambassadour with a fewe others (by Gods preservation and speciali favour) onely with much difficultie saved. In which shipwracke not onely the saide shippe was broken, but also the whole masse and bodie of the goods laden in her, was by the rude and ravenous people of the Countrey thereunto adjoyning, rifled, spoyled and caried away, to the manifest losse and utter destruction of all the lading of the said ship, and together with the ship, apparell, ordinance and furniture belonging to the companie, in value of one thousand pounds, of all which was not restored toward the costs and charges to the summe of five hundred pound sterling.



As soone as by letters'addressed to the said companie, and in London delivered the sixt of December last past, it was to them certainely knowen of the losse of their Pilote, men, goods and ship, the same merchants with all celeritie and expedition, obteined not onely the Queenes majesties most gracious and favourable letters to the Ladie Dowager, and lordes of the Councell of Scotland for the gentle comfortment and entertainment of the saide Ambassadour, his traine and companie, with preservation and restitution of his goods, as in such miserable cases^ to Christian pitie, princely honour and meere



35 2



Justice appertaineth, but also addressed two Gentlemen of good learning, gravitie and estimation, videlicet, Master Lawrence Hussie Doctor of the Civill Lawe, and George Gilpin with money and other requisites into the Realme of Scotland, to comfort, ayde, assist, and relieve him and his there, and also to conduct the Ambassadour into England, sending with them by poste a Talmach or Speachman for the better furniture of the service of the sayde Ambassadour, trusting thereby to have the more ample and speedie redresse of restitution : which personages using diligence, arrived at Edenborough (where the Queenes court was) the three and twentieth day of the saide moneth of December, who first visiting the saide Ambassadour, declaring the causes of their comming and Commission, shewing the letters addressed in his favour, the order given them for his solace and furniture of all such things as hee woulde have, together with their daily and readie service to attend upon his person and affaires, repaired consequently unto the Dowager Queene, delivering the letters.



Whereupon they received gentle answeres, with hope and comfort of speedie restitution of the goods, apparell, jewels and letters: for the more apparance whereof, the Queene sent first certaine Commissioners with an Harold of armes to Pettislego, the place of the Shipwracke, com-maunding by Proclamation and other Edictes, all such persons (no degree excepted) as had any part of such goods as were spoyled and taken out or from the ship to bring them in, and to restore the same with such further order as her grace by advise of her Councel thought expedient: by reason whereof not without great labours, paines and charges (after long time) divers small parcels of Waxe, and other small trifling things of no value, were by the poorer sort of the Scottes brought to the Commissioners, but the Jewels, rich apparell, presents, gold, silver, costly furres, and such like, were conveyed away, concealed and utterly embezelled. Wherupon, the Queene at the request of the said Ambassadour, caused n	353	z

divers persons to the number of 180. or moe, to be called personally before her princely presence, to answer to ye said spoile, & really to exhibit and bring in all such things as were spoiled and violently taken, & caried out of the same, whereof not onely good testimonie by writing was shewed, but also the things themselves found in the hands of the Scottish subjects, who by subtile and craftie dealings, by connivence of the commissioners, so used or rather abused themselves towards the same Orator & his attendants, that no effectuall restitution was made: but he fatigated with daily attendance and charges, the 14. day of February next ensuing, distrusting any reall and effectual rendring of the saide goods and mar-chandizes and other the premisses, upon leave obtained of the saide Queene, departed towards England, having attending upon him the said two English Gentlemen and others (leaving neverthelesse in Scotland three Englishmen to pursue the deliverie of such things as were collected to have bene sent by ship to him in England: which being in Aprill next, and not before imbarked for London, was not at this present day here arrived) came the 18. day of Februarie to Barwike within the dominion and realme of England, where he was by the Queenes majesties letters and commandement honourably received, used and interteined by the right honourable lord Wharton, lord Warden of the East marches, with goodly conducting from place to place, as the dayly journeys done ordinarily did lie, in such order, maner and forme, as to a personage of such estate appertaineth. He prosecuting his voyage until the 27. of Februarie approched to the citie of London within twelve English miles, where he was received with fourscore merchants with chaines of gold and goodly apparell, as wel in order of men servants in one uniforme liverie, as also in and upon good horses and geldings, who conducting him to a marchants house foure miles from London, received there a quantitie of gold, velvet and silke, with all furniture thereunto requisite, wherewith he made him a riding garment,



354



reposing himselfe that night. The next day being Saturday and the last day of Februarie, he was by the merchants adventuring for Russia, to the number of one hundred and fortie persons, and so many or more servants in one liverie, as abovesaid, conducted towards the citie of London, where by the way he had not onely the hunting of the Foxe and such like sport shewed him, but also by the Queenes majesties commandement was received and embraced by the right honourable Viscount Montague, sent by her grace for his entertainment: he being accompanied with divers lustie knights, esquiers, His honorable gentlemen and yeomen to the number of three hundred horses led him to the North partes of the Citie of London, where by foure notable merchants richly apparelled was presented to him a right faire and large gelding richly trapped, together with a footcloth of Orient crimson velvet, enriched with gold laces, all furnished in most glorious fashion, of the present, and gift of the sayde merchants: where upon the Ambassadour at instant desire mounted, riding on the way towards Smithfield barres, the first limites of the liberties of the Citie of London. The Lord Maior accompanied with all the Aidermen in their skarlet did receive him, and so riding through the Citie of London in the middle, betweene the Lord Maior and Viscount Montague, a great number of merchants and notable personages riding before, and a large troupe of servants and apprentises following, was conducted through the Citie of London (with great admiration and plausibilitie of the people running plentifully on all sides, and replenishing all streets in such sort as no man without difficultie might passe) into his lodging situate in Fant church streete, where were provided for him two chambers richly hanged and decked, over and above the gallant furniture of the whole house, together with an ample and rich cupboord of plate of all sortes, to furnish and serve him at all meales, and other services during his abode in London, which was, as is underwritten, until the third day of May: during which



355



time daily divers Aidermen and the gravest personages of the said companie did visite him, providing all kind of victuals for his table and his servants, with al sorts of Officers to attend upon him in good sort and condition, as to such an ambassadour of honour doeth and ought to appertaine.



It is also to be remembred that at his first entrance into his chamber, there was presented unto him on the Queenes Majesties behalfe for a gift and present, and his better furniture in apparel, one rich piece of cloth of tissue, a piece of cloth of golde, another piece of cloth of golde raised with crimosin velvet, a piece of crimosin velvet in graine, a piece of purple velvet, a piece of Damaske purpled, a piece of crimosin damaske, which he most thankfully accepted. In this beautifull lodging refreshing and preparing himselfe and his traine with things requisite he abode, expecting the kings majesties repaire out of Flanders into England, whose highnesse arriving the one and twentie of March, the same Ambassadour the five and twentieth of March being the Annunciation of our Ladie (the day twelvemoneth he took his leave from the Emperour his master) was most honourably brought to the King and Queenes majesties court at Westminster, where accompanied first with the said Viscount and other notable personages, and the merchants, hee arriving at Westminster bridge, was there received with sixe lords, conducted into a stately chamber, where by the lords, Chancellor, Treasurer, Privie seale, Admiral!, bishop of Elie, and other Counsellors, hee was visited and saluted: and consequently was brought unto the Kings and Queenes majesties presence, sitting under a stately cloth of honour, the chamber most richly decked and furnished, and most honourably presented. Where, after that hee had delivered his letters, made his Oration, given two timber of Sables, and the report of the same made both in English and Spanish, in most loving maner embraced, was with much honour and high entertaine-ment, in sight of a great confluence of people, Lordes and 356



Ladies eftsoones remitted by water to his former lodging, to the which, within two dayes after by the assignement of the King and Queenes majesties, repaired and conferred with him secretly two grave Counsellers, that is, the lord Bishop of Elie, and Sir William Peter Knight, chiefe Secretary to their Highnesse, who after divers secret talkes and conferences, reported to their highnesse their proceedings, the gravitie, wisedome, and stately behaviour of the sayd Ambassadour, in such sort as was much to their majesties contentations.



Finally concluding upon such treaties and articles of amitie, as the letters of the Kings and Queenes majesties most graciously under the great seale of England to him by the sayd counsellers delivered, doth appeare.



A.D.

A league and articles of ami-tie concluded and confirmed under the



The three and twentieth of April, being the feast of S. great seale of George, wherein was celebrated the solemnitie of the England. Noble order of the Garter at Westminster, the same lord ambassadour was eftsoones required to have audience: and therefore conducted from the sayd lodging to the court by the right Noble the lords Talbot and Lumley to their majesties presence: where, after his Oration made, and thanks both given and received, hee most honourably tooke his leave with commendations to the Emperour. Which being done, he was with special honour led into the chappell, where before the Kings and Queens majesties, in the sight of the whole Order of the Garter, was prepared for him a stately seate, wherein he accompanied with the Duke of Norfolke, the lords last above mentioned, and many other honorable personages, was present at the whole service, in ceremonies which were to him most acceptable: the divine service ended, he eftsoones was remitted and reduced to his barge, and so repaired to his lodging, in like order and gratulation of the people universally, as before.



The time of the yeere hasting the profection and Foure goodly departure of the Ambassador, the merchants having prepared foure goodly and well trimmed shippes laden for with all kinds of merchandises apt for Russia, the same Russia, 15 5 q.



357



Ambassadour making provision for such things as him pleased, the same ships in good order valed downe the River of Thames, from London to Gravesend, where the same Ambassadour with his traine and furniture was imbarked to wards his voyage homeward, which God prosper in all felicitie.



It is also to be remembred, that during the whole abode of the sayd Ambassadour in England, the Agents of the sayde marchants did not onely prosecute and pursue the matter of restitution in Scotland, and caused such things to be laden in an English shippe hired purposely to convey the Ambassadours goods to London, there to be delivered to him, but also during his abode in London, did both invite him to the Maior, and divers worshipfull mens houses, feasting and banquetting him right friendly, shewing unto him the most notable and commendable sights of London, as the kings palace and house, the Churches of Westminster and Powles, the Tower and Guild hall of London, and such like memorable spectacles. And also the said 29. day of April, the said merchants assembling themselves together in the house of the Drapers hal of London, exhibited and gave unto ye said Ambassador, a notable supper garnished with musicke, Enterludes and bankets: in the which a cup of wine being drunke to him in the name and lieu of the whole companie, it was signified to him that the whole company with most liberal and friendly hearts, did frankly give to him and his all maner of costs and charges in victuals riding from Scotland to London during his abode there, and untill setting of saile aboord the ship, requesting him to accept the same in good part as a testimonie and witnes of their good hearts, zeale and tendernesse towards him and his countrey.



It is to be considered that of the Bona Speranza no word nor knowledge was had at this present day, nor yet of the arrivall of the ships or goods from Scotland.



The third of May the Ambassadour departed from London to Gravesend, accompanied with divers Aidermen 358



1557-and merchants, who in good gard set him aboord the noble shippe, the Primrose Admiral to the Fleete, where leave was taken on both sides and parts, after many imbracements and divers farewels not without expressing of teares.



Memorandum, that the first day of May the Counsellers, The King and videlicet, the Bishop of Elye, and Sir William Peter on Queens second the behalfe of the Kings and Queenes Majesties repairing R^nurof to the lorde Ambassadour did not onely deliver unto him Russia. their highnes letters of recommendations under the great seale of England to the Emperour, very tenderly and friendly written, but also on their majesties behalfe gave and delivered certaine notable presents to the Emperours person, and also gifts for the lord Ambassadours proper use and behoofe, as by the particulars under written appeareth, with such further good wordes and commendations, as the more friendly have not bin heard, whereby it appeareth how well affected their honours be to have and continue amitie and traffique betweene their honours and their subjects: which thing as the kings and Queenes majesties have shewed of their princely munificences & liberalities, so have likewise the merchants and fellowship of the Adventurers, for and to Russia, manifested to the world their good willes, mindes and zeales borne to this new commensed voyage, as by the discourse above mentioned, and other the notable actes over long to be recited in this present memoriali, doeth and may most clearely appeare, the like whereof is not in [I. 289.] any president or historic to bee shewed.



Forasmuch as it may bee doubted how the ship named the Edward Bonaventure suffered shipwracke, what became of the goods, howe much they were spoiled and deteined, how little restored, what charges and expenses ensued, what personages were drowned, how the rest of the ships either arrived or perished, or howe the disposition of almightie God hath wrought his pleasure in them, how the same ambassadour hath bene after the miserable



359



case of shipwracke in Scotland unreverently abused, and consequently into England received and conducted, there intertained, used, honoured, and finally in good safetie towards his returne, and repaire furnished, and with much liberalitie and franke handling friendly dismissed, to the intent that the trueth of the premisses may bee to the most mightie Emperour of Russia sincerely signified in eschewment of all events and misfortunes that may chance in this voyage (which God defend) to the Ambassadours person, traine, and goods, this present memoriali is written, and autentikely made, and by the sayde Ambassadour his servants, whose names be underwritten, and traine in presence of the Notarie, and witnesses undernamed, recognized, and acknowledged. Given the day, moneth, and yeere underwritten, of which instrument into every of the sayde Shippes one testimoniali is delivered, and the first remaineth with the sayde Companie in London.
