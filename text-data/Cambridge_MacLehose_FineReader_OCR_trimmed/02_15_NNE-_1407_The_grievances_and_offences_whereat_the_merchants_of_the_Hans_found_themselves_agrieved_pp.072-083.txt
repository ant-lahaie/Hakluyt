These be the grievances and offences, whereat the marchants of the Hans of Almaine, comming unto, and residing in the Realme of England, doe finde themselves aggrieved, contrarie to the Articles and privileges of the Charter graunted unto them by the worthy Progenitors of the king of England that now is, and also by the saide soveraigne Lord the King, ratified, and confirmed.



Mprimis, whereas the foresaide marchants have a privilege graunted unto them by Charter, that they may, in cities, boroughs, and in other towns and villages throughout the whole realme of England, exercise traffique in grosse, as wel with the natural inhabitants of the kingdome,



as with strangers, and private persons: of late, those that are free denizens in the cities, boroughs, and villages within the foresaid kingdome, do hinder and restrain all others that be strangers, foreners, and aliens, that they neither can, nor dare buy and sei with the marchants of the Hans aforesaid, to their great hinderance and losse.



Item, the foresaid marchants by vertue of their charter were wont to have and to hold Innes and mansions, for the reposing of themselves and of their goods, wheresoever they pleased in any cities, boroughs, or villages, throughout the whole kingdome : howbeit of late the foresaide marchants are not suffered to take up their mansions, contrary to the tenour of their charter.



Item, the foresaid marchants are privileged not to undergoe any other burthens or impositions, but onely to pay certaine customs, as it doeth by their charter manifestly appeare. Notwithstanding at ye same time when Simon de Moreden was maior of London, the foresaid marchants were constrained, in the ward of Dove-gate at London, to pay fifteenths, tallages, and 72



other subsidies contrary to the liberties of their charter. Whereupon the saide marchants prosecuted the matter before the Councel of our soveraign lord the king, insomuch that they were released from paying afterward any such tallages, fifteenths, and subsidies. Which marchants, a while after, of their owne accord and free will, gave unto the gild-hall of London an hundreth markes sterling, conditionally, that they of the ci tie aforesaide should not at any time after exact or demaund of the said marchants, or of their successors, any tallages, fifteenths, or subsidies, contrary to the tenor of their charter, as by records in the foresaid gild-hall, it doth more plainly appeare. Howbeit of late the officers of our lord the king, in the foresaid ward of Dove-gate, constrained the marchants aforesaid to pay tallages, fifteenths, & other subsidies. And because the saide marchants murmured and refused to pay any such contributions, alleaging their privileges, the foresaid officers arrested the goods of those said marchants (which are as yet detained upon the arrest) notwithstanding that they were released before the councel of our soveraigne lord the king, & also that they gave unto the said gild-hall one hundreth marks to be released, as it is aforesaid. And also the foresaid marchants were constrained to pay I2.d. in the pound, and of late 6.d. and other subsidies, more then their ancient customes, to the great damage of those marchants.



Item, the foresaid marchants are privileged as touching The ancient customs of wols by them bought within the realm of ^1°™* England, y£ they are not bound to pay, over & besides w°° ’ their ancient customs, but onely xl.d. more then the homeborn marchants of England were wont to pay. But now ye foresaid marchants are compelled to pay for every sack of wool (besides ye ancient custom & the 4O.d. aforesaid) a certain imposition called Pence for the Pence for the town of Cales, namely for every sack of wool i9.d. more then the marchants of England doe pay, to their great losse, & against the liberty of their charter.



THE ENGLISH VOYAGES



Item, the foresaid marchants are privileged by their charter, that concerning the quantity of their marchandize brought into the realme of England (in regard whereof they are bound to pay 3.d. for the worth of every pound of silver) credit is to be given unto them for the letters of their masters and of their companies, if they were able to shew them. And if so be they had no letters in this behalfe to shew, that then credite should bee given unto themselves, and that their othe, or the othe of their atturney should be taken, without any other proof, as touching the value of their marchandize so brought in, & that thereupon they should be bound to pay customs, namely the customes of 3-d. justly for that cause to be paid. But nowe the customers of our soveraigne lorde the king put their goods to an higher rate then they ought or were woont to be: and heereupon they compell them to pay custome for their goods, at their pleasure, scanning about their fraight and expenses particularly disbursed in regard of the said goods and marchandize, to the great hinderance of the said marchants, and against the tenor of their charter.



Item, the foresaid marchants by way of pitiful complaint do alleage, that whereas the worthy progenitors of our Lord the king that now is, by vertue of the saide great charter, graunted libertie unto them to pay the customes of certain clothes, namely of skarlet, and cloth died in grayne, and of other clothes of assise, which were by them to be caried out of the realme of England, even as by their foresaid Charter it doeth more plainly appeare: and whereas our soveraigne lord the king that now is (ratifying and confirming the saide charter, and being willing that they shoulde have more especiall favour shewed unto them) granted unto them by their Charter, that the said marchants should be exempted and freed from all custome and imposition of small clothes, as in pieces and in narrow clothes which were not of assise, and in such other clothes of like qualitie: yet of late the Customers of our Lorde the King that nowe is, not allow-74



ing their saide speciali Charter so graunted unto the speciali marchants aforesaid, do compel them to pay for straight Charter. clothes and for pieces of clothes which are not of assise, (together with other demands particularly & severally made) as great custome as if the clothes were full out of assise. Moreover also of late, the customers of the smal The customers or pety custome & of the subsidie doe demand of them oftheW) custome for kersey-clothes equal unto the custome of ' those clothes, that be of ful assise, whereas the foresaid marchants were not wont to pay for those kerseys by vertue of their Charter, but onely according to the worth of ech pound of silver, as namely for other goods which are of golde weight: to the great hinderance of the foresaid parties, and against the manifest graunt of our soveraigne Lord the king, as it appeareth in the said speciali Charter.



Item, the said marchants alleage, that they are privi-ledged by their Charter, if they pay custome and subsidy for their goods in the behalfe of our lord the king, at any port of England where those goods have arrived, and afterward would transport the saide goods or any part of them unto any other port within the realme aforesaid: that then they should be quite released from paying of any other custome for the same goods, if they bring a warrant that they have paide the saide custome, as is aforesaide. Of late it fortuned, that a certaine man of their societie named Nicholas Crossehaire, being a 1405. marchant of the lande of Prussia, immediatly after the concord was concluded betwene the English and the Prussians, brought unto the towne of Sandwich a shippe laden with bow-staves and other marchandize, and there well and truely paide the custome of our lord the king for all his wares: and selling there part of the same goods, he afterward transported parcel thereof in a small barke unto London, there to be solde, and caried a warrant also with him, that he had at Sandwich paid the custome due unto our lord the king: & yet (the said warrant notwithstanding) the customers of the pety custome &



subsidy of London came & demanded custome of him at another time contrary to reason, & against the tenor of their charter: and the said Nicholas offred pledges unto them, yea, even ready money downe into their hands, until the question were discussed and determined, whether he should pay new custome or no: but this they would not doe. Then the said Nicholas brought a brief from our lord the king, to get himselfe discharged from paying the said custome: and for all that, the foresaid customers would not as yet have regard unto him, but kept the said goods within shipboord, upon the river of Thames, for the space of 15. dayes, until he had paid another custom, to the great losse of the said Nicholas, for that which he sold first at Sandwich to be delivered at London for seven nobles, he could not afterward have for it above foure nobles, and yet so was it solde, by reason of the harme which his wares had taken by lying so long upon the water, contrary to the tenor of their Charter.



Item, the said marchants do alleage, that another of their company called Peter Hertson bought at Bristow certain clothes, & laded the same in a ship, to be transported for Prussia, for the which he truely paide at Bristow, the customs & subsidies due unto our soveraign lord the king: which ship with the foresaid goods arriving at London: the customers of the pety-custome and of the subsidie there would not permit the said ship with the goods to passe unto the parts aforesaid, until the said Peter had paid another custome for the same goods (the warrant, which he brought with him notwithstanding) to his great hinderance, and contrary to the tenour of their Charter.



Item, pitifully complaining the foresaid marchants alleage, that wheras every marchant, bringing wares into the realm, was wont to have a schedule wherein his name was written, for a specification & certificat of the quantity of his goods in the said schedule to be found at the arrival of the ship, without paying therfore ought at all, of late the customers of the pety custome do compel them to pay 76



for ech mans name written a peny, at ye arrival of their goods out of every ship wherin the said goods are found, what commodities & marchandize soever they be: whenas notwithstanding, if there be a chest or any other smal matter, there should not therfore be any custome due unto our lord the king, nor any received unto his Majesties use. In like maner do the customers of the The customers subsidy deale. Wheras also the foresaid marchants were not wont to pay for a cocket for the conveyance & transportation of their goods out of the realme (albeit many names were written therein) more then 4-d. of late the customers of the pety custom do compel them to pay for every name contained in the same cocket, 4-d. and in like sort do the customers of the saide subsidy deale.



Which contribution in a yere extendeth it self unto a great summe, to the unknown prejudice of our lord the king, more then any man could suppose, (for the [I- 173 ] customers enjoy their fees and commodities from his Majestie that they may doe him faithfull service) and likewise to the great damage of the said marchants.



Item, pitifully complaining the said marchants do alleage that they are constrained to pay for subsidy, sometime I2.d. and somtime 6.d. in the pound, contrary to the tenor of their charter : and yet notwithstanding when their marchandize commeth to the wharf, the customers prolong & delay the time 3. or 4. weeks before they wil take custome for their goods, in the which space other marchants sei their goods, the customers not regarding whether the goods aforesaid take wet or no ; to the great damage aswel of our lord the king, as of the said marchants : because, if they had quicke dispatch, they might pay custome unto his Majestie oftner then they doe.



Item, the said marchants doe farther alleage, that the customers of the petie custome, and of the subsidie in the port of London have appointed among themselves certaine men to seale up the goods of the saide marchants, so soon as they are arrived at the port of safetie, until the 77



said goods be customed. By meanes of the which sealing, the foresaide parties doe compell the marchants abovenamed, (upon an use and custome whereof themselves have bene the authors) to paye a certaine summe of money, to the great hinderance of the sayde marchants, and contrarie to justice and to their charter. Moreover, the saide customers have ordained betweene themselves, that the saide marchants shall put or make up no cloth into fardels, to transport out of the realme, unlesse certaine men appointed by them for the same purpose bee there present, to see what maner of clothes they bee, under paine of the forfeiture of the saide goods. Also of late, when the sayde march ants would have made up such fardels, the foresayde parties assigned to be overseers refused to come, unlesse they might have for their comming some certaine summe of money, delaying and procrastinating from day to day, so long as themselves listed, to the great losse and undoing of the foresaide marchants, and contrarie to their liberties : because the foresaide customers are bound by their office to doe this, without any contribution therefore to bee paide unto them by the saide marchants : for that they doe enjoy from our soveraigne Lorde the King their fees and commodities, to the ende that they may serve him and every marchant justly and faithfully, without any contribution by them to be imposed anewe upon the sayde marchants, of custome.



Item, the said marchants doe alleage, that the customers & bailifs of the town of Southhampton do compel them to pay for every last of herrings, pitch, & sope ashes brought thither by them 2.s. more then the kings custome : and for ech hundreth of bowstaves & boords called Waghenscot, 2.d. for every hundreth of boords called Richolt, 4.d. & for al other marchandize brought by the foresaid marchants unto the same towne : which contributions they never paid at any time heeretofore, being greatly to their hinderance, and contrary to the tenour of their Charter.



HANSE MERCHANTS’ GRIEVANCES a.d. .	1407-



Item, the foresaid marchants do alleage, that one of their company, called Albert Redewish of Prussia, bringing divers goods & marchandizes unto Newcastle upon Tine, & there paying the usual custom of 3.d. in the pound for al his wares, the bailifs of the saide towne, against all reason, exacted 7. pound sterling at his hands more then the custome : whereupon the foresaide marchant got a briefe from the kings majesty, for the recovery of the said 7.H. according to equity & reason : howbeit, that at the comming of the said briefe the foresaid bailifes would do nothing on his behalfe, but would have slaine their foresaid associate, contrary to their charter and priviledges.



William Esturmy knight, & John Kington canon of Lincolne, being by ye most mighty prince & lord, L. Henry by Gods grace K. of England & France & lord of Ireland, sufficiently deputed and appointed to parle, treate, & agree wl the common society of ye marchants of the Hans of Dutchland or Almain, concerning & about the redressing & reformation of unjust attempts happening between our said soveraign L. the king his liege people & subjects on the one part, & between the common society aforesaid, the cities, towns, & particular persons therof on the other part: do (for the behalf of our said sovraign L. the king, with a mind & intention to have al & singular ye things underwritten to come to the knowledge of the said common society) intimate, declare, & make known unto you (hono. sirs) Henr. Westhoff citizen & deputy of the city of Lubec, Henry Fredelaw, Joh. van Berk citizen of Colen, Mainard Buxtehude citizen, 8c deputy of the city of Hamburgh, M. Simon Clawsten clerk, sir John de Aa knight deputie of the citie of Rostok, Herman Meyer deputy of the citie of Wismar, being, as the procurators, messengers, 8c commissioners of the foresaid cities, assembled together at the town of Hage in Holland, with ye forenamed Will. 8c John in regard of the foresaid redres 8c reformation : that, even as our



said soveraign L. the king his meaning is not to disturb or hinder such priviledges as have bin heretofore granted & vouchsafed unto the common society of the marchants aforesaid, by the renoumed kings of England, & the worthy progenitors of our L. the K. that now is, & by himself also under a certain form confirmed : even [I. 174.] so he is determined (without, ye prejudice of forren lawes) upon just, mature and sober deliberation, by his royall authoritie to withstand such priviledges, as by reason of the abuse thereof, have bene infinitely prejudicial! unto himselfe and his subjects.



Inprimis the said ambassadours doe affirme as afore, that whereas all and every the Marchants of the said company, as often as they would, were, both in the Realme of England, and in other territories & dominions subject unto our soveraigne lord the king, admitted and suffered (according to the tenor of the forenamed priviledges granted unto them) freely, friendly and securely to traffique and converse with any of his Majesties liege people and subjects whatsoever, or with other people of whatsoever nation living in the realme of England, or in the dominions aforesaid: the said common society of marchants by their publike & deliberate common counsel did appoint & ordain, y* no society in any cities, townes, or places, neither yet any particular man of any such society (there being no lawfull or reasonable cause why) shoulde in any wise admit any marchants of the realm of England resorting unto their cities or other places for marchandise, to enjoy intercourse of traffike: but that the saide English marchants should bee altogether excluded from all traffike and mutuall conversation among them, by denouncing and inflicting grievous penalties of money as well upon cities as other places, and upon particular marchants also of the foresaid societie practising the contrary.



Item, that immediatly after, the foresaid parties enacting and ordaining published their sayde statute and 80



ordinance, in all kingdomes, provinces, partes, cities, and townes, wherin any marchants of the said societie were conversant.



Item, that after that publication, the statute and ordinance aforesaid by every of the marchants of the forenamed society were inviolably observed.



Item, that the said statute and ordinance hath bene so rigorously put in execution, that whereas immediatly after certaine English marchants with their ships, mariners, and marchandize beeing in a certaine part of one of the principali cities of the foresaide societie, utterly destitute of meate, drinke, and money, publikely offred to sell their wollen clothes of England, onely to provide themselves of necessary victuals: yet the marchants of the saide citie, stoutely persisting in their statute and ordinance aforesaid, straightly prohibited the buying of such clothes, unchristianly denying meate and drinke unto the said English marchants.



Item, the foresaid society decreed and ordained, that no marchant of the saide company should in any place or countrey whatsoever, buy any woollen clothes of the realme or dominion of England (albeit offered by others and not by English men) or, having bought any, should, after the terme prefixed, sei them, imposing grievous pecuniary mulcts, besides the forfeiture of the clothes so bought or sold, upon them that would attempt the contrary.



Item, that after the said statute and ordinance, the foresaide societie decreed, that all marchants of the said companie, having among their wares and marchandise any woollen clothes made in England, should either sell the saide clothes, or within a short space then limited should, under penaltie of forfeiting the said clothes, utterly renounce the use and commodi tie thereof: Not- The Hans withstanding a grievous penaltie of money being imposed societie deter-upon the violaters of the same statute.	of

Statutes against English marchants in Norway and in Suedland.



said authors and publishers thereof imagining, according to their desire, that by this meanes an utter extirpation and overthrow of English marchants might, yea & of necessity must ensue: upon their serious & long premeditated deliberation, straitely commanded & injoyned, under pain of losing the benefit of all privileges, wheresoever, or by the princes of what lands, or the Magistrates of what Cities or townes soever vouchsafed unto the said common societie, that not only the aidermen of that society in al places throughout the realme of England, but also al other marchants of the said company, after the maner of marchants conversing in the saide Realme, should, without exception of persons, utterly abstein from all intercourse of traffike with the marchants of the realme aforesaid: yea, and that they shoulde depart out of the said kingdome within a very short space limited. For the dispatching of al which premisses without delay, it was according to their commandement effectually provided.



Item, that the society aforesaid hath approved divers very unreasonable statutes & ordinances, made & published by the marchants of the same society residing in the kingdoms of Norway and Swedland, to the great prejudice of the kingdome of England, and the marchants thereof: and as yet both covertly and expresly do approve the same, unjustly putting them in daily execution.



Item, wheras in the privileges & indulgences granted by ye renoumed princes somtimes kings of England, ye worthy progenitors of our sovereign lord the king y1 now is, unto the society aforesaid, it is provided, y‘ the said marchants shal not avow any man which is not of their company, nor shal not colour his goods and marchandize under their company: whereas also in the [I. 175.] confirmation of the sayd priviledges made by our soveraigne lord that nowe is, it is manifestly provided, that the marchants of the Hans towns, under the colour of their priviledges in England, shall not upon paine of



the perpetuali frustration and revocation of the fore-sayd priviledges, receive any stranger of any other towne in their liberties, by whom the kings custome may in any sort be withholden or diminished: & yet the contrary unto al these provisoes hath bin every yere, for these 20. yeres or thereabout notoriously practised and committed, as well joyntly by the generail counsell, and toleration of the foresayd society, as also severally by the advise and permission of divers particular cities of the foresayd Hans company to the great diminution of his majesties custome, the estimation whereof the foresayd ambassadors are not able at this present fully to declare. But that all occasions of the last above mentioned diminution may bee prevented for the time to come, the sayd ambassadors doe demand to have from How many U’ the foresayd societie a declaration in writing, what and be the

what maner ot territories, cities, townes, villages or companies they be, for which the sayd society challengeth and pretendeth, that they ought to enjoy the priviledges granted unto their marchants, as is above mentioned.



Moreover, it is required by the foresaid ambassadors, if the societie aforesayd hath not decreed nor ordayned the things above written, that the names of the cities and places decreeing and ordaining such statutes & ordinances, may by the sayd common society either now or at some other times and places convenient for the same purpose, be expressed and set downe in writing.
