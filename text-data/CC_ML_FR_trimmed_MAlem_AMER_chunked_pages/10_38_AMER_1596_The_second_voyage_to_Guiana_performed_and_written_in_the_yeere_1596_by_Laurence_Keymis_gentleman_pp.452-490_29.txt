be satisfy for this injury . when we have take aboard we such victual as be in the pinnace : we set fire in she , ( for her rudder can serve she to no long use ) and stop the flood , ply to windwarde with the ebb near the shore , until we be sixteen league to the eastward of the river mouth , and then stand off to sea , we fall in twenty four hour sail with Punta de galera 477 the english voyage the northeaster most part of Trinidad . but have tabaco - island in sight , we first go thither . this island be plentiful of all thing , and a very good soil . it be not now inhabit , because the charibe of Dominica be evil neighbour unto it . they of Trinidad have a meaning and purpose to fly thither , when no long they can keep Trinidad . their only doubt be , that when they be seat there , the Spaniard will seek to possess it also . the governor of Margarita go late in a pinnace to view this island . Gilbert my pilot who sometime live there , note it for the best and fruitful ground that he know . Thence we return to Punta de galera and anchor in ten fathom under the north side of the island some five or six mile from the say point . the flood - tide strike alongst the coast to the eastward very strong . we discharge a piece of ordinance , and afterward go to the shore in our boat : but no Indian come unto we . i will have send John of Trinidad to procure some of they to speak with we : but he be altogether unwilling , allege that their dwelling be far within the mountain , and that he know no part of that side of the island . from this place we set sail for Santa Lucia , but fall with Granata , which we find not inhabit . saint Vincent we hardly recover , by turn under the lee of the island .
