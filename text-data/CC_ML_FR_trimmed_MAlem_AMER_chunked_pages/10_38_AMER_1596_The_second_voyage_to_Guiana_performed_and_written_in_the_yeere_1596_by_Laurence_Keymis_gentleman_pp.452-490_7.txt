there to be have , where Caiane fall into the sea , ( for it stand in the mouth of Wia and Caiane ; ) it yield safe and good harbour in four and five fathom for ship of great burden . on all that coast we find not any like it : we therefore honour this place by the name of port Howard . the road under Triangle island , which be the westermost from the rest and stand in five degree , which have also store of fish , foul , dear and Iwanas , be good , but not comparable with this other , where in all wind and weather , ship , though they be many , may all ride secure . the hill and high land be limit to this bay on each side : for to the eastward beyond it appear none at all , and to the westward of mount Hobbeigh very few . where the mountain fail , there Brasill wood be no far to be seek for : but in all part cotton , pepper , silk and balsamum tree do grow in abundance . the root of the herb wia - passa be here most plentiful : i find they in taste nothing different from good ginger , and in operation very medicinable against the flix and headache . Theise river , as also other near Raleana , do all fall out of the plain of this empire over rock , as the river 458 Caroli do into Raleana : and in most place within the utmost hedge of wood , the land within be plain , void of tree , and bear short grass like arromaiaries country . next adjoin unto these , be the river Cunanamma , uracco , Mawara , Mawarparo , amonna , marawini , Oncowi , wiawiami , Aramatappo , Camaiwini , Shurinama , Shurama , Cupanamma , Inana , Guritini , Winitwara , berbice , Wapari , Maicaiwini , Mahawaica , Wappari , lemdrare , Dessekebe , caopui , pawrooma , moruga , waini , barima , amacur , aratoori , Raleana . from cape Cecyl to Raleana
