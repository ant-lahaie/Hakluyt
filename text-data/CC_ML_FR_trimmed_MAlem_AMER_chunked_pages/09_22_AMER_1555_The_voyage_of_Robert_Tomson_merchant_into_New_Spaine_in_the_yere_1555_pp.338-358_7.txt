that will not serve . than we cut our main mast and throw all our ordinance into the sea save one piece , which early in a morning when we think we shall have sink , we shoot off , and as please God there be one of the ship of our company near unto we , which we see not by mean of the great fog , which hear the sound of the piece , and understand some of the company to be in great extremity , begin to make towards we , and when they come within hear of we , we desire they for the love of God to help to save we , for that we be all like to perish . they will we to hoist our foresail as much as we can and make towards they , for they will do their best to save we , and so we do : and we have no soon hoist our foresail , but there come a gale of wind and a piece of a sea , strike in the foresail , and carry sail and mast all overboard , so that than we think there be no hope of life . and then we begin to embrace one another , every man his friend , every wife her husband , and the child their father and mother , commit our soul to almighty God , think never to escape alive : yet it please God in the time of most need when all hope be pass , to aid we with his help hand , and cause the wind a little to cease , so that within two hour after , the other ship be able to come aboard we , and take into she with her boat man , woman and child , naked without hose or shoe upon many of our foot . i do remember that the last person that come out of the ship into the boat , be a woman black moor , who leap out of the ship into the boat with a young suck child in her arm , leap too short and fall into the sea
