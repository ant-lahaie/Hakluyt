i kill with my piece a grey hare . the 13 in the morning we see three or four white 421 bear , but dare not go on shore to they for lack of a good boat . this day we strike a rock seek for a harbour , and receive a leak : and this day we be in 54 degree of latitude . the 14 we stop our leak in a storm not very outrageous , at noon . the 15 be almost in 52 degree of latitude , and not find our ship , nor ( accord to their promise ) any kind of mark , token , or beacon , which we will they to set up , and they protest to do so upon every head land , island or cape , within twenty league every way off the fish from their fish place , which our captain appoint to place between between 54 and 55 degree : this 15 i say we shape ^ ■ ee of lati - our course homeward for England , have in our ship tude . but little wood , and half a hogshead of fresh water . our man be very willing to depart , and no man more forward than peerson , for he fear to be put out of his office of stewardship : but because every man be so willing to depart , we consent to return for our own country : and so we have the 16 fair weather , with the wind at Southwest . the 17 we meet a ship at sea , and as far as we can judge it be a biskaine : we think she go a fish abundance of for whale ; for in 52 degree or thereabouts we see very whale in m d € et £€ s . < # e ’ the 18 be fair , with a good gale at west . the 19 fair also , with much wind at west and by south . they arrive at Dartmouth the 15 of September . and thus after much variable weather and change of wind we arrive the 15 of September in Dartmouth anno 1587 , give thank to God for our safe arrival .
