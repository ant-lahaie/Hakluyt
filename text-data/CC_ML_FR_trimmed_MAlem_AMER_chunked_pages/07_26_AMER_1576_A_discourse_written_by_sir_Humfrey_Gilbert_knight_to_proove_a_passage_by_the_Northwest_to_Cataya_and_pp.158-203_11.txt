so far as my simple reason can comprehend ) that this perpetuali current can by any mean be maintain , but only by continual reaccess of the same water , which pass through the fret , and be bring about thither again , by such circular motion as aforesaid . and the certain fall thereof by this fret into mar deal Sur be prove by the testimony and experience , of Bernard de la Torre , who be send from P . de la Natividad to the Moluccae , anno domini 1542 . by commandment of Anthony Mendoza , than viceroy of Nova Hispania , which Bernard sail 750 . league , on the northside of the aequator , and there meet with a current , which come from the north - east the which drive he back again to Tidore . wherefore , this current be prove to come from C . de buona speranda to the fret of Magellan , and want sufficient entrance there , by narrowness of the strait , be by the necessity of nature force , bring to terra de Labrador , where Jaques Cartier meet the same , and thence certain know , not to strike over upon island , Lappia , etc and find by Bernard de la Torre in Mar del Sur , on the backside of America : therefore this current ( have none other passage ) must of necessity , fall out through this our fret into mar deal Sur , and so trending by the Moluccae , China , and C . de buona speranda , maintain it self by circular motion , which be all one in nature , with motus ab orient in occidentem . A . D . 1576 . the flow m occasion by reason that the heat of the moon boil , and make the water thin by way of rarefaction . a experience to prove the fall of this current into mar deal Sur . so that it seem , we have now more occasion to doubt of our return , than whether there be a passage that way , yea or no : which doubt ,
