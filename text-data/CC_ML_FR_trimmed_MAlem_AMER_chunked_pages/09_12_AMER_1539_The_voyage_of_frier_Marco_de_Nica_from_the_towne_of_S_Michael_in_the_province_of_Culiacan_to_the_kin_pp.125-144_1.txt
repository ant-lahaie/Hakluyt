have will and command that it shall be so . with the foresay company i go on my voyage until i come to the town of Petatlan , find all the way great entertainment , and provision of victual , with rose , flower , and other such thing , and bower which they make for i of chalk and bough plait together in all place where there be no house . in this town of Petatlan i rest 3 . day , because my companion Honoratus fall so sick , that i be constrain to leave he there behind . then , accord to my say instruction , i follow my journey as the holy ghost do lead i , without any merit of i , have in my company the say Stephan the negro of Dorantez , and certain of the Indian which have be set at liberty , and many of the people of the country , which give i great entertainment and welcome in all place where i come , and make i bower of tree , give i such victual as they have , although they be but small : because ( as they say ) it have not rain there in 3 year , and because the Indian of this country seek mean rather to hide themselves , than to sow corn , for fear of the Christians of the town of S . Michael , which be wont to make inroad even to that place , and to war upon they , and to carry they away captive . in all this way , which may be about 25 . or 30 . league from that part of Petatlan , i see nothing worthy the note , save that there come to seek i certain Indian from the island , where Fernando Cortes the mark of the valley have be , of who i be inform , that it be a island , and not firm land , as some suppose it to be . they come to you firm land upon certain raft of wood : and from the main to the island be but half a league by sea , little more or less .
