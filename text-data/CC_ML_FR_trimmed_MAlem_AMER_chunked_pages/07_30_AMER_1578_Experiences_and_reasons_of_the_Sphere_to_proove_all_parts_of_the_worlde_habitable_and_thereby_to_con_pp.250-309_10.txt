at Paris be sixteen hour long , and the night but eight : where contrariwise under the equinoctial the day be but twelve hour long , and so long be also the night , in whatsoever parallel the sun be : and therefore look what odds and difference of proportion there be between . the sun abode above the horizon in Paris , and the abode it have under the equinoctial , ( it be in cancer ) the same proportion will seem to be between the heat of the one place , and heat of the other : [ three . 51 . ] for other thing ( as the angle of the whole ark of the sun progress that day in both place ) be equal . but under the equinoctial the presence and abode of the sun above the horizon be equal to his absence , and abide under the horizon , each be twelve hour . and at Paris the continuance and abode of the sun be above the horizon sixteen hour long , and but eight hour absence , which proportion be double , from which if the proportion of the equality be subtract to find the difference , there will remain still a double propor - 259 inn what proportion the angle of the sun beante heat . they use and have need of fire under the equinoctial . cold intermingle with heat under the equinoctial . the english voyage cion , whereby it seem to follow , that in June the heat at Paris be double to the heat under the equinoctial . for ( as i have say ) the angle of the sun beam be in all point equal , and the cause of difference be , Mora solis supra horizontem , the stay of the sun in the one horizon more than in the other . therefore , whosoever can find out in what proportion the angle of the sun beam heat , and what increase the sun continuance do add thereunto , it may express be set down , what force of heat and cold be in all region . thus
