answer this : that albeit , in every part of the coast of America , or elsewhere this current be not sensible perceive , yet it have evermore such like motion , either in the uppermost or nethermost part of the sea : as it may be prove true , if you sink a sail by a couple of rope , near the ground , fasten to the nethermost corner two gun chamber or other weight : by the drive whereof you shall plain perceive , the course of the water , and current , run with such course in the bottom . by the like experiment , you may find the ordinary motion of the sea , in the ocean : how far soever you be off the land . 9 also there come another current from out the north - east from the scythian sea ( as m . Jenkinson a man of rare virtue , great travail and experience , tell i ) which run westward towards Labrador , as the other do , which come from the south : so that both these current , must have way through this our fret , or else encounter together and run contrary course , in one line , but no such conflict of stream , or contrary course be find about any part of Labrodor , or terra nova , as witness our yearly fisher , and other sailor that way , but be there digest , as aforesaid , and find by experience of Barnard de la Torre , to fall into mar deal Sur . 10 furthermore , the current in the great ocean , can not have be maintain to run continual one way , from the begin of the world unto this day , have there not be some thorough passage by the fret aforesaid , and so by circular motion be bring again to maintain it self : for the tide and course of the sea be maintained by their interchangeable motion : as fresh river be by spring , by ebb and flow , by rarefaction and condensation . 168 so that it rest not possible (
