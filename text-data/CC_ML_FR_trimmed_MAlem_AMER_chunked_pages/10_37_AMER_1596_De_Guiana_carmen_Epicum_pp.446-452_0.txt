de Guiana carmen epicum . [ in . 669 . ] hat work of honour and eternal name , for all the t ’ atchieve , fill i with hand to my heart world t ’ envie and we fury , and give arm peace , that else will glad turn my limb and every sense into my thought rapt with the thirst action of my mind ? o Clio , honour muse , sing in my voice , tell the attempt , and prophecy th ’ exploit of his eliza - consecrated sword , that in this peaceful charm of England sleep , open most tender her age throat , offer to power fresh youth through all her vein , that flesh of brass and rib of steel retain . riches , and conquest , and renown i sing , riches with honour , conquest , without blood , enough to seat the monarchic of earth , 446 like to Jove eagle on Eliza hand . Guiana , who rich foot be mine of gold , who forehead knock against the roof of star , stand on her tiptoe at fair England look , kiss her hand , bow her mighty breast , and every sign of all submission make , to be her sister , and the daughter both of our most sacred maid : who barren ness be the true fruit of virtue , that may get , bear and bring forth anew in all perfection , what heretofore savage corruption hold in barbarous chaos ; and in this affair become her father , mother , and her heir . then most admire sovereign , let your breath go forth upon the water , and create a golden world in this our iron age , and be the prosperous forewind to a fleet , that second your last , may go before it in all success of profit and renown : doubt not but your election be divine , ( aswell by fate as your high judgement order ) to raise he with choice bounty , that can add height to his height ; and like a liberali vine , not only bear his virtuous fruit aloft , free from the press of squint - eyed envy foot , but deck his gracious prop with golden bunch , and shroud it with broad leaf
