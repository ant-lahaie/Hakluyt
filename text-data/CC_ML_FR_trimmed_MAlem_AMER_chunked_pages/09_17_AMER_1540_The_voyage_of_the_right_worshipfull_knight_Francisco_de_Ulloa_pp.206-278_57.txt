much marvel that in so rough and wild a country ( as far as we can discern ) there shall be people . here we stay all day , make four or five pit to take in water which we want , which though it be bad , and in small quantity we refuse not ; and so the evening be come , we return to our boat , and so come unto our ship which ride a good league from the shore . the next day be Wednesday the fourteenth of the say month our general command we to set sail , and we sail about the say hand on the same side which we coast when we come from Nueva Espanna : for when we arrive on the coast we see five or six fire ; wherefore he desire to see and learn whether it be inhabit ; and at the far end of this inlet or bay where we ride there come out before we a Canoa , wherein be four Indian which come row with certain small oar , and come very near we to see what we be : whereupon we tell our general , that it be best to send some of we out with our boat to take these Indian or some one of they to give they something that they may think we to be good people : but he will not consent thereto , because he mind not to stay , have then a pretty gale of wind , whereby he may sail about this hand , hope that afterward we may find and take some other to speak with they , and give they what we will to carry on shore ; and as we sail near the land , we see a great hill full of goodly tree of the bigness of the tree and cypress of Castille . we find in this hand the foot of wild beast and cony , and see a piece of pine tree - wood , whereof we gather , that there be store 256 of they in that country . thus sail
