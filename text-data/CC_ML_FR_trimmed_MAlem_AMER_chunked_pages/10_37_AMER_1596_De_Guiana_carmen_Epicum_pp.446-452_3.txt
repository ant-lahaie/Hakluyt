a body numb ’ d with surfeit , feel not thy gentle application for the health , use , and honour of her power ! yet shall my verse through all her ease - locked ear trumpet the noblesse of thy high intent : and if it can into act proceed , the fault and bitter penance of the fault make red some other eye with penitence , for thou be clear ; and what more nimble spirit , apt to bite at such unhook bait gain by our loss ; that must we needs confess thy princely valour will have purchase we . which shall be fame eternal to thy name , though thy contentment in thy grave desire , of our advancement , fail deserv ’ d effect . o how i fear thy glory which i love , lest it shall dear grow by our decrease . nature that stick in golden - graveld spring , in muck - pit can escape their swallowing . but we shall forth i know ; gold be our fate , which all our act do fashion and create . then in the thespiad bright prophetic fount , i think i see our liege rise from her throne , her ear and thought in steep amaze erect , at the most rare endeavour of her power . and now she bless with her wont grace th ’ industrious knight , the soul of this exploit , dismiss he to convoy of his star . and now for love and honour of his worth , our twice - borne noble bring he bridegroom - like , that be espouse for virtue to his love with feast and music , ravish the air , to his argolian fleet , where round about 4so his bate colour english valour swarm in haste , as if guianian Orenoque with his fell water fall upon our shore . and now a wind as forward as their spirit , set their glad foot on smooth guianas breast , where ( as if each man be a Orpheus ) a world of savage fall tame before they , store their theft - free treasury with gold , and there do plenty crown their wealthy field , there learning eat no more his thriftless book , nor valour estridge - like his iron arm .
