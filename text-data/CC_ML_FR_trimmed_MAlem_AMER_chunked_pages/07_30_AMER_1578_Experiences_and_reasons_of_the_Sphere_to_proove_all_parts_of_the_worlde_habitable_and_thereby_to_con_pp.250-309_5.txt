i seem very substantiali and sure reason . first you be to understand that the sun do work his moor or less heat in these low part by two mean , the one be by the kind of angle that the sun beam do make with the earth , as in all torrida zona iter make perpendicular right angle in some place or other at noon , and towards the two pole very oblique and uneven angle . and the other mean be the long or short continuance of the sun above the horizon . so that wheresoever these two cause do most concur , there be most excess of heat : and when the one be want , the rigor of the heat be less . for though the sun beam do beat perpendicular upon any region subject unto it , if it have no continuance or abode above the horizon , to work his operation in , there can no hot effect proceed . for nothing can be do in a moment . and this second cause mora solis supra horizontem , the time of the sun abide above the horizon , the old philosopher never remember , but regard only the manner of Angles that the sun beam make with the horizon , which if they be equal and right , the heat be the great , as in torrida zona : if they be unequal and oblique , the heat be the less , as towards both pole , which reason be very good and substantiali : for the perpendicular beam reflect and reverberate in themselves , so that the heat be double , every beam strike twice , and by unite be multiply , and continue strong in form of a column . but in our latitude of 50 . and 60 . degree , the sun beam descend oblique and slant wise , and so strike but once and depart , and therefore our 255 heat be cause by two mean that be by his manner of angle and by his continuance . note this reason . heat be the less for any effect that the angle
