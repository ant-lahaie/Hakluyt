And see that there the coast turn towards the east , despair to find the passage , i turn back again , and sail down by the coast of that land towards the equinoctial ( ever with intent to find the say passage to India ) and come to that part of this firm land which be now call Florida , where my victual fail , i depart from thence and return into England , where i find great tumult among the people , and preparation for war in Scotland : by reason whereof there be no more consideration have to this voyage . whereupon i go into Spain to the catholique king , and queen Elizabeth , which be advertise what i have do , entertain i , and at their charge furnish certain ship , wherewith they cause i to sail to dis - 148 cover the coast of Brasile , where i find a exceed great and large river name at this present Rio de la plata , that be , the river of silver , into the which i sail and follow it into the firm land , more than six score league , find it every where very fair , and inhabit with infinite people , which with admiration come run daily to our ship . into this river run so many other river , that it be in manner incredible . after this i make many other voyage , which i now pretermit , and wax old , i give my self to rest from such travel
