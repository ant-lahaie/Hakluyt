cloth for ready money tell down for four hundred and fifty and five hundred reye , the merchant will have buy it all of i : but i will sell no more , because i mean to exchange it in Angola for Negros . howbeit with ready money in hand in Angola a man shall buy better negro , and better cheap . the captain of our ship sell all his cloth for ready money for four hundred 8c fifty rey the cubit , and think that he have make a good market : but he have deceive himself . i sell six broad clothes for five hundred and fifty rey the cubit : and i be offer thirty thousand rey for a cloth . vinegar be sell for two and thirty , and six and thirty , and forty real a jar , by reason there be great store of limmons and orange in the country : but in Angola it be more worth . olive be sell for half a real a piece : wherefore i hope to sell the hogshead for twenty thousand rey . in taffeta and velvet there will be get two hundred and fifty and three hundred for one hundred . if i have bring great store , i can have sell it all at this rate . i have already get good store of real of plate : for it be tell i that money be a good commodity in Angola . but i must employ some in meal , which be in the grind . all the rest of my money i will send you by bill of exchange , and some part i will employ in sugar : for i have send order to Baia for that purpose . for from this place there be no ship that do go that way . so these letter i do send by the way of Fernambuc , and have direct they to my cousin : for i do determine to settle my self here in this country . there be come down from Peru , by this river of plate , a merchant call Alonso Ramires , and he have bring down with he ten or twelve thousand ducat in real of plate , and be come down to this place to build he a ship to return into Spain ; and there be come in his company a bishop . and thus Jesus Christ send you long health . your love brother Francis Suares .
