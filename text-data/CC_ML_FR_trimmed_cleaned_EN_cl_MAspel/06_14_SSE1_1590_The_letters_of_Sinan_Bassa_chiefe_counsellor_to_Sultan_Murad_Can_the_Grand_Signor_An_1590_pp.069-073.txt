 MOst glorious , and the most resplendent of women , most select Princess , most gracious Elizabeth Queen of the valiant followers of Jesus in the famous kingdom of England , most wise governess of all the affairs and businesses of the people and family of the Nazarens , most sweet fountain of brightness and glory , most acceptable cloud of rain , inheritress & Lady of the blessedness and glory of the renowned kingdom of England , to whom in humble wise all men offer their petitions : wishing of the almighty Creator most happy increase and prosperous success unto all your Majesties affairs and actions , and offering up mutual & perpetuali vows worthy of our familiarity , with eternal praises : In most friendly manner we signify unto your princely Highness , that certain years passed the most mighty Cesarlike majesty of the Grand Signor waged unspeakable wars with Casul-bas the Prince of the Persians , in regard of which wars he would not go in battle against any other places ; and for that cause 
 certain thieves in the parts of Polonia called Cosacks , and other notorious persons living in the same parts ceased not to trouble and molest the subject's of our most mighty Emperor . But now having finished and brought to some good issue his affairs in Persia , determining to punish the said malefactors of Poland , and for that purpose committing and army unto the Beglerbeg of Grecia , and the year last passed , sending his imperiali commandment unto the Prince of the Tartars , he hath foraged , molested , and laid waste some part of the kingdom of Poland , and the Cosacks and other notorious offenders have received condign punishment . Which the king of Poland perceiving sent two Ambassadors to his imperiali Highness signifying , that he would hunt out the said malefactors , and inflict most severe punishments upon them , and also that he would better his gift , which he hath for many years heretofore ordinarily sent unto the porch of his imperiali Highness . Howbeit his imperiali majesty ( upon whom the almighty creator hath bestowed so great power , and who vouchsafeth to give ear unto all humble suppliants ) rejecting the supplication of the King of Poland , determined again to send his army against the said king , and by the help of the Almighty creator , utterly to subvert and overthrow his kingdom . By your Majesties Ambassador resident in the blessed and glorious porch of his imperiali Highness interposing himself as a mediator , signifying that from the parts of Poland you were furnished with corn , gunpowder , masts of ships , guns , and other necessaries , and craving peace on the behalf of the kingdom and king of Poland , and making intercession , that the said king might not be molested nor troubled by the means of the Grand Signor , & declaring that this was your Majesties most earnest desire ; so soon as the report and intercession of your Majesties Ambassador was signified unto the Grand Signor , for your sake , unto whom all honour and favourable regard is due , upon the condition aforesaid , namely , that the wicked Cosacks 
 might be sought out and grievously punished , or that their offences might be remitted for the valve of some small gift , upon this condition ( I say ) the letters of his imperiali Highness were sent unto the king of Poland . Howbeit had not this conclusion of league and amity been solicited on the behalf of your Majesty , his imperiali Highness would never have vouchsafed the same unto the kingdom of Poland . But for your Majesties sake his imperiali Highness hath exhibited this so singular a favour unto the said king and kingdom of Poland . And hereof your Majesty and the king of Poland ought certainly to be persuaded . We wish your Majesty most happily and well to fare . Given at Constantinople in the end of the month called Sabaum , in the year of our sacred prophet Mahomet 998 , and in the year of Jesus 1590 , the 12 of June .
