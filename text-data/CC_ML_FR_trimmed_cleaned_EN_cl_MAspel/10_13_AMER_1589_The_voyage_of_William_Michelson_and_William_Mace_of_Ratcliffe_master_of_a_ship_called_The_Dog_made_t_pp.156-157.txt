A brief remembrance of a voyage made in the year 1589 by William Michelson Captain , and William Mace of Ratcliffe , Master of a ship called the Dog , to the Bay of Mexico in the West India . 
 He aforesaid ship called the Dog , of the burden of threescore and ten tons was furnished , and armed forth with the number of fortie men : it departed from the coast of England in the month of May , directly for the West India : It fell with the Bay of Mexico , and there 
 met with diverse Spanish ships at sundry times , whereof three fell into her lapse and were forced to yield unto the mercy of the English : the last that they met within the Bay was a Spanish man of war , whom the English chased , and after three several fights , upon three diverse 156 
 days , pressed him so far that he entreated a parley , by putting out a flag of truce : the parley was granted , and certain of the Spaniards came aboard the English . Where after conference about those matters that had passed in the fight betwixt them , they received reasonable entertainment and a quiet farewell . The Spanish , as if they had meant to requite the English courtesy , invited our men to their ship , who persuading themselves of good meaning in the Spanish , went aboard : but honest and friendly dealing was not their purpose , suddenly they assaulted our men , and one with a dagger stabde Roger Kingsnod the English Pilot to the heart and slew him , and others were served with the like sauce , only William Mace the Master & others , notwithstanding all the prepared traps of the enemy , leapt overboard into the sea , and so came safe to their own ship : and directing his course for England , arrived at Plimouth the tenth day of September , 1589 , laden with wines , iron , Roans , which is a kind of linen cloth , and other rich commodities , looking for the arrival of the rest of his consorts , whereof one and the principali hath not long since obtained his Port. Thus much in generail terms only I have as yet learned , and received touching this voyage , extracted out of letters sent from the aforesaid William Mace , to Master Edward Wilkinson of Towerhill in London . My principali intention by this example is to admonish our nation of circumspection in dealing with that subtle enemy , and never to trust the Spanish further , then that their own strength shall be able to master them : for otherwise whosoever shall through simplicity trust their courtesy , shall by trial taste of their assured cruelty .
