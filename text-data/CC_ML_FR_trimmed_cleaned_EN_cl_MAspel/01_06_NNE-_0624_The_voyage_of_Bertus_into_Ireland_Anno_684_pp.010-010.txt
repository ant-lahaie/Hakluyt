The voyage of Bertus , generail of and army sent into Ireland by Ecfridus king of Northumberland , in the year of our Lord 684 , out of the 4. Book and 26. Chapter of Beda his Ecclesiastical ! History . 
 The same in English . 
 IN the year of our Lord 684 , Ecfrid the king of Northumberland sent captain Bert into Ireland with and army , which Bert miserably wasted that innocent nation being always most friendly unto the people of England , insomuch that the fury of the enemy spared neither churches nor monasteries . Howbeit the Islanders to their power repelled arms with arms , and craving Gods aid from heaven with continual imprecations and curses , they pleaded for revenge . And albeit cursed speakers can by no means inherit the kingdom of God , it was thought notwithstanding , that they which were accursed for their impiety did not long escape the vengeance of God imminent for their offences .
