To the right honourable my very good Lord , the Lord Boris Pheodorowich , Master of the horses to the great and mighty Emperor of Russia , his Highness Lieutenant of Cazan and Astracan , William Cecill Lord Burghley , Knight of the noble Order of the Garter , and Lord high Treasurer of England , sends greeting . 
 Right honourable my very good Lord , upon the last return of our merchant's ships out of Russia , there was brought unto my hands , by one Francis Cherry and English merchant , a letter directed to the Queens Majesty , from the great and mighty Emperor of Russia , and another 
 letter from your Lordship directed to me : which said letter written from the Emperor to her Majesty hath been considerately and advisedly by her Highness read and perused , and the matter of complaint against Jerome Horsey therein comprised thoroughly examined : which hath turned the same Horsey to some great displeasure . I did also acquaint our Majesty with the contents of your Lordship's letters written to me , and informed her of your Lordship's honourable favour showed to her Highness merchant's from time to time : who took the same in most gracious part , and confessed her self 43° 
 .... 15911 infinitely beholding unto your Lordship for many honourable offices done for her sake , the which she meant to acknowledge by her letters to be written to your Lordship under her princely hand and seal . And forasmuch as it hath pleased your good Lordship to take into your hands the protection of her Majesties merchant's , and the redress of such injuries as are , or shall be offered unto them contrary to the meaning of the privileges and the free liberty of the intercourse , wherein in some points your Lordship hath already used a reformation , as appears by your said letters : yet the continuance of traffic moving new occasions and other accidents tending to the loss of the said merchant's , whereof some particulars have been offered unto me to treat with your Lordship upon : I thought it good to refer them to your honourable consideration , that order might be taken in the same , for that they are apparently repugnant to the Emperors letters written to her Majesty , and do much restrain the liberty of the trade : one is , that at the last coming of our merchant's to the port of Saint « a new Michael the Archangel , where the mars is held , their ? word ' goods were taken by the Emperors officers for his Highness service at such rates , as the said officers were disposed to set upon them , so far under their valve , that the merchant's could not assent to accept of those princes : which being denied , the said officers restrained them of all further traffic for the space of msrc^ants 3 three weeks , by which means they were compelled to strMned fnm yield unto their demand how unwillingly soever , their Mart. Another is , that our said merchant's are driven to pay the Emperors officers custom for all such Russe money as they bring down from the Mosco to the Sea side to employ there at the Mars within the Emperors own land ; which seems strange unto me , considering the same money is brought from one place of the Country to another , and there employed without any transport over of the said money . These interruptions and impositions seem not to stand with the liberties of the 
 431 
 Emperors privileges and freedom of the intercourse , which should be restrained neither to times or conditions , but to be free and absolute : whereof it may please your Lordship to be advised , and to continue your honourable course held between the Emperor and her Majesty , to reconcile such differences as any occasion does offer to their league or traffic . Thus not doubting of your Lordship's furtherance herein , I humbly take my leave of your good Lordship . From her Majesties royal 1591. palace of Whitehall this 15 of January , 1591.
