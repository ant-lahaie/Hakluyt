 The same in English . 
 Sir , I received your letters the 19. of June : it grieved me much that upon the sighed of them the time being spent , I could not give any convenient instructions : I wish Arthur Pet had be informed before his departure of some speciali points . The voyage to Cathaio by the East , is doubtless very easy and short , and I have oftentimes marveiled , that being so happily begun , it hath be left of , and the course changed into the West , after that 278 
 more then half of your voyage was discovered . For A great gulf beyond the Island of Vaigats and Nova Zembla , there u beyond followeth presently a great Bay , which on the left side is enclosed with the mighty promontory Tabin . Into the mighty rivers mids hereof there fallen great rivers , which passing through descend . the whole country of Serica , and being as I think navigable with great vessels into you heart of the continent , may be and easy means whereby to traffic for all manner of merchandise , and transport them out of Cathaio , Mangi , Mien , and other kingdoms thereabouts into England . But considering with my self that that navigation was not intermitted , but upon great occasion , I thought that the Emperor of Russia and Moscovie had hindered the proceeding thereof . If so be that with his grace and favour a further navigation may be made , I would counsel them certainly not first to seek out the promontory Tabin , but to search this bay and rivers The best aforesaid , and in them to pick and choose out some c^se t0 convenient port and harbour tor the English discoveries . merchant's , from whence afterwards with more opportunity and less peril , the promontory Tabin and all the coast of Cathaio may be discovered . And that there is such a huge promontory called Tabin , I am certainly persuaded not only out of Plinie , but also other writers , and some Maps ( though somewhat rudely drawn : ) and that the pole of the Loadstone is not far beyond Tabin , I have learned by the certain observations of the Loadstone : about which pole and Tabin I think there are very many rocks , and very hard and dangerous sailing : and yet a more hard and difficile passage I think it to be this way which is now attempted by the West , for it is nearer to the pole of the Loadstone , to the which I think it not safe to approach . And because the Loadstone hath another pole then that of the world , to the which from all parts it hath a respect , the nearer you come unto it , the more the needle of the Compass doth vary from the North , sometime to the West , and sometime to the East , according as a man is to the Eastward or to the 
 279 
 Westward of that Meridian , that passes by both the poles of the Magnes and the World . 
 This is a strange alteration and very apt to deceive the Sailer , unless he know the unconstancy and variation of the Compass , and take the elevation of the pole sometimes with his instruments . If master Arthur be not well provided in this behalf , or of such dexterity , that perceiving the error he be not able to correct the same , I fear least in wandering up and down he loose his time , and be overtaken with the ice in the midst of the enterprise . For that gulf , as they say , is frozen every year very hard . Which if it be so , the best counsel I could give for their best safety , were to seek some harbour in that bay , and those rivers whereof I have spoken , and by some Ambassador to make friendship and acquaintance with the great Can , in name of the Queens majesty , which I believe will be grateful to the mightiest Emperor in the world , yea most excellent for the length of the traffic , and great distance of The mouths the places . I think from the mouths of the mighty rivers Bautisus and Oechardus to Cambalu the chiefest andOechardus c .. , „ . 
 300. leagues seat °* the prince the Can , there are not passed 300. from Cam - Germane miles , and to pass by Ezina a city of the balu . kingdom of Tangut , which seems to be but 100. 
 Germane miles from the mouths of the said rivers , and is subject to the great Can . 
 I would gladly know how high the sea doth flow commonly in the port of Moscovia where your men do harbour , and in other Easterly places unto Tabin . And also whither the sea in this straight do flow always one way to the East or to the West , or whither it do ebb [ I . 445-1 and flow according to the manner of the tides in the burvatims of ° ? the channel , that is to say , whither it flow there she tides J s'xe hours into the West , and as may back again to depend great the East , for hereupon depend other speculations of speculations , importance . I would wish M. Frobisher to observe the same Westwards . Concerning the gulf of Merosro and Canada , and new France which are in my maps , 
 280 
 they were taken out of a certain sea carded drawn by a certain priest out of the description of a Frenchman , a Pilot very skilful in those parts , and presented to the worthy prince George of Austria , bishop of Liege : for the trending of the coast , and the elevation of the pole , I doubt not but they are very near the truth : For the Chart had , beside a scale of degrees of latitude passing through the midst of it , another particularly annexed to the coast of New France , wherewith the error of the latitudes committed by reason of the variation of the compass might be corrected . The historic of the voyage of Jacobus Cnoyen Buschoducensis throughout all Asia , Afirica , and the North , was lent me in time passed by a friend of mine at Antwerpe . After I had used it , I restored it again : after many years I required it again of my friend , but he had forgotten of whom he had borrowed it . The writings of Gulielmus Tripolitanus , and Joannes de Plano Carpini I never saw : only I found certain pieces of them in other written hand books . I am glad the Epitome of Abilfada is translated , I would we might have it shortly . 
 Thus much Sir I thought good to answer your letters : if there be any thing else that you would require of me , I will most willingly communicate it with you , craving this likewise of your courtesy , that whatsoever observations of both these voyages shall come to your hands , you would impart them to me , they shall all remain with me according to your discretion and pleasure , and whatsoever I gather of them , I will faithfully signify unto you by letters , if happily they may yield any help or light unto this most excellent enterprise of navigation , and most profitable to our Christian common wealth . Fare you well most learned friend . At Duisburg in Cliveland , 28. of Julie , the year , 1580. 
 At Arthur his return I pray you learn of him the things I have requested , and whither any where in his voyage , he found the sea fresh , or not very salt : for 281 
 I suppose the Sea between Nova Zembla and Tabin to be fresh . 
 Yours wholly to my power to be commanded , Gerardus Mercator .
