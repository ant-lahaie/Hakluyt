The order of the Catena given to the ships that go out of Spaine , to the Indies . 
 He ship of what burden soever she be must give a Carena , as they call it in the Spanish tongue , which is in English , she must be thoroughly calked , and fortified , as well with carpenters to set knees into her , and any other timbers appertaining to the strengthening of a ship , as with 
 calking : which is to put occam into her sides ; and that kind of calking is not used , as ours is here in England ; but first before they put in any thread of occam , they with certain crooked irons , with and hammer in one 
 hand , and the crooked iron in the other , do forcibly pull out all the old thread that hath be in the ship the voyage before , and so drive in new . 
 If the seam of the ship be worn to any breadth , as many old ships be , by reason of often raking them , upon that seam there is clapped a piece of cast lead , nailed upon the calking , and seam with speciali nails , which lead is cast a hands breadth , and as thin ne as may be for the same purpose , and at every voyage it is taken 
 Calking with thin â–  plataeae of led . 
 off and renewed , and by that means their ships are very staunch a year or two . 
 The Carenero or the Calker doth give in sureties , that if the ship so cast over , as they do commonly use to cast them , in such sort as any man may go dry upon the keel , as I have done , and without any butt , pipe , or any other kind of timber under her sides , more then with counterpoise of stones in her , made within certain timber as though it were a chest ; and with the stones the Carenero doth bring her as he will , high and low , leaning , or rising : and if she miscarry in her Carena , 
 The Calker or Carenero .
