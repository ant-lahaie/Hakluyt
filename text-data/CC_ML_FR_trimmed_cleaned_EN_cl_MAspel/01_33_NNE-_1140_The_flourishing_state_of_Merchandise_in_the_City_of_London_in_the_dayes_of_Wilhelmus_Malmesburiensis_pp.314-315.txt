 Ot far from Rochester , about the distance of five and twenty miles , stands the Noble City of London , abounding with the riches of the inhabitants , and being frequented with the traffic of Merchants resorting thither out of all nations , and especially out of Germanie . Whereupon it comes to pass , that Germanie . when any generail dearth of victuals falls out in England , by reason of the scarcity of corn , things necessary may there be provided and bought with less gain unto the sellers , and with less hindrance and loss unto the buyers , then in any other place of the Realm . Outlandish wares are conveyed into the same City by the famous river of Thames : which river springing out of a fountain 80. miles beyond the City , is called by one and the self same name . 70. miles beneath it .
