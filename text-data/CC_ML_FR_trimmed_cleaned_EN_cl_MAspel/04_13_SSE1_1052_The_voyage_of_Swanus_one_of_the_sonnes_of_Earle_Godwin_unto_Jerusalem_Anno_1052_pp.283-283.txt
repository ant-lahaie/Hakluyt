The voyage of Swanus one of the sons of Earl Godwin unto Jerusalem , Anno Dom. 1052 , recorded by William of Malmsburie lib . 2. de gestis regum Anglorum , Capite 13. 
 The same in English . 
 SWanus being of a perverse disposition , and faithless to the king , often times disagreed with his father and his brother Harold : and afterwards proving a pirate , he stained the virtues of his ancestors with his robberies upon the seas . Last of all , being guilty unto himself of the murder of his kinsman Bruno , and ( as some do report ) of his own brother , he travailed unto Jerusalem : and in his return home , being taken by the Saracens , was beaten , and wounded unto death .
