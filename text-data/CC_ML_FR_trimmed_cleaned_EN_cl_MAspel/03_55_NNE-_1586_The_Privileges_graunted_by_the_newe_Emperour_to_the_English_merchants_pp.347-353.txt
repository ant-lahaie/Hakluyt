Pheodor Ivanowich the new Emperor's gracious letter of privilege to the English Merchant's word for word , obtained by M. Jerome Horsey . 1586. 
 Hrough the will of the almighty , and without beginning God , which was before this world , whom we glorify in you Trinitie , one only God the father , the son , and the holy ghost , maker of all things , worker of all in all every where , fulfiller of all things , by which will and 
 working , he both loves and gives life to man , That 347 
 our only God , which inspireth every one of us his only children with his word , to discern God through our Lord Jesus Christ , and the holy quickening spirit of life now in these perilous times , Establish us to keep the right Sceptre , and suffer us of our selves to reign to the good profit of the land , and to the subduing of the people , together with the enemies , and to the maintenance of virtue . 
 We Pheodor the offspring of John , the great Lord , Emperor , king and great prince of all Russia , of Volo-demeria , Moscovia and Novogrod , king of Cazan , king of Astracan , Lord of Plesko , and great prince of Smolensko , of Tuer , Yougoria , Permia , Viatsko , of Bolghar and others , lord and great prince of the land of the lower Novogrod , Chernigo , Rezan , Polotsko , Rostow , Yeraslave , the White lake , Liefland , Oudor , Condensa , and Ruler of all Siberia , and all the Northside , and lord of many other countries . 
 I have gratified the merchant's of England , to wit , sir Rowland Haiward , and Richard Martin Aidermen , sir George Barnes , Thomas Smith esquire , Jerome Horsey , Richard Saltonstall , with their fellows . 
 I have licensed them to sail with their ships into our dominion the land of Dwina , with all kind of commodities to trade freely , and unto our kingdom and the city of Mosco , and to all the cities of our empire of Moscovia . 
 And the english merchant's sir Rowland Haiward & his society desired us , that we would gratify them to trade into our kingdom of Moscovia , and into our heritage of great Novogrod and Plesko , and into all parts of our kingdom , to buy and fell with their wares without custom . 
 Therefore we for our sisters sake Queen Elizabeth , & also because that they allege that they had great loss and hindrance by the venture of the sea , and otherwise , have gratified the said English merchant's sir Rowland Haiward and his society , freely to come into 348 
 our kingdom of Moscovia , and into all our dominions with all kind of commodities , to trade , & traffic freely , & at their pleasure with all kind of their commodities : also I have commanded not to take any manner of custom for their goods , nor other customs whatsoever : That is to say , neither for passing by any place by water , nor for launching , neither for passing through any place by land , neither for the vessels or boats , nor for their heads , nor for passing over bridges , nor for ferying over at any place , neither for acknowledgement at any place where they shall come , nor any manner of custom or duty , by what name soever . 
 Only they shall not bring with them into our dominions , neither recarie out of our dominions , or father any other men's goods but their own , neither fell them nor barter them away for them . 
 Also our natural people shall not buy and fell for them , or from them , neither shall they retain or keep any of our natural subject's goods , or pawns by them to colour them . 
 Also they shall not send any of their Russe servants about into any city to engross , or buy up commodities , but into what city they themselves shall come , they shall buy and sei , and shall sei their own commodities and not ours . 
 And when they shall come into our inheritance of great Novogrod and Plesko , and through all our dominions with their commodities , then our noblemen and captains , and every one of our officers shall suffer them to depart according to this our letter , & shall take no custom at all of them , for any of their commodities , neither for passing through or passing by , nor for passage over any bridges , nor shall take of them any other duty whatsoever name they have . 
 Also into what places of our dominion , or when they shall happen to come , and to proceed to buy or fell , and wheresoever they shall pass through with goods not buying of any commodities , neither will fell 
 349 
 their own , then in those cities and towns they shall take no manner of custom or duty of them , accordingly as before . 
 And I have gratified them and given them free leave to traffic throughout all the dominions of our kingdom in all cities with their goods , to buy and fell all manner of commodities , without any duty or custom whatsoever . 
 And the English merchant's where they are desirous to buy or fell , or barter their wares with our merchant's , whole wares for wares , they shall fell their commodities whole , and not by retail : That is to say , neither by small weight nor by the yard , to fell or barter in their own houses , and they shall sei and barter their wares wholly , Cloth by the pack , and by the whole Cloth , and Damask and velvet by the piece and not by the yard , and all manner of commodities that are to be sold by weight , not to fell by the small weights , as by the pound and ounce , but by whole sale : also they shall sei wines by the pipe : and by the gallon , quart or stoop they shall not fell . 
 And they shall buy , fell and exchange their own commodities themselves , and the Russe merchant's shall not make sales or exchange for them or from them any of their commodities , neither shall they themselves convey or carry through any other men goods at no place in stead of their own : and which of the English merchant's will at any time fell his commodities at Colmogro or Vologda or Yeraslave , they may , and of their commodities throughout all our cities and dominions , our noblemen , captains , and every of our officers shall take no manner of custom , according as it is written in this our gracious letter : and throughout all our dominions and cities they shall hire carriers and vessels with men to labour , at their own charge , to transport their goods . 
 So likewise , whensoever the English merchant's are disposed to depart out of our kingdom into any other country or into their own land , if our pleasure be , they shall take our goods with them from our Treasury , 35° 
 and shall fell them , and exchange them for such commodity as is commodious for our kingdom , and shall deliver it into our Treasury , and with those our commodities , our Noblemen and captains , and every of our officers shall let them pass through all our cities also without custom according to these our letters . 
 Also whensoever the English merchant's shall have sold their own goods & : bought themselves commodities , & will depart out of Mosco , then they shall manifest themselves to our chief Secretary Andrew Sholkalove , in the office where the Ambassadors are always dispatched . 
 And if the English merchant's coming , have had any mischance by the sea , insomuch that the ship be broken , or if that ship do come to any part of our country : then we will cause the goods to be sought out in true Justice , and to be given to the English people , which at that time shall be here resident in our country : and if so be that it so fallen out that at that time there be no Englishmen within our realm : then will we cause these goods to be laid up in a place together , and when the people of England shall come into our realm , then we will command all those goods to be delivered to the said English people . 
 Also we have gratified all the English merchant's with the house of one Urie here in the Mosco right over against S. Maxims church behind the market , and they shall dwell in the same house according as before time , and they shall keep one always in the house to keep it , either a Russe , or one of their own people . 
 Also the English merchant's shall possess their houses , to wit , at Yeraslave , Vologda , Colmogro , and the house at the haven of the sea , & they shall dwell in those houses , according as our goodness hath be to them heretofore : and we have commanded , that there shall not be taken of them no yearly rend , nor no manner of custom , tax , rend or any other duty whatsoever for those houses , neither shall they pay any duty or tax with any of the townsmen of those places , & in every 
 351 
 one of those houses , to wit , at Yeraslave , Vologda , and Colmogro , they shall have men to keep their houses , two or three of their own country people , strangers or else Russes , men of the meanest sort , which shall be no merchant's , that they may lay their goods in those houses , and they may fell the commodities out of those their houses to whom they please , according to this our gracious letter : and those that keep their houses shall not fell or buy no part of their commodity , except they be there or give order , whereby they be not deceived by them . 
 So likewise I have gratified them with their house at the sea haven , at the mouth of Podezemsky , & we have commanded that they shall not carry their goods from thence to the new castle S. Michael the archangel , but shall arrive , and do as they have done heretofore with their wares at that their house , and shall unladen their commodities out of their ships , and shall lade them again with Russe commodities , even there at that their house without interruption : only they shall permit our officers of Colmogro & sworn men to write up those commodities , both the commodities of England , and those of Russeland , what the merchant's shall declare themselves , & no otherwise , but they shall not overlook their commodities , neither shall they unbind any of their packs . 
 And when the English merchant's are disposed to send into their own country , to wit , any of their own people on land through any other kingdom whatsoever , they shall not send their people without our kingly knowledge and commandment , and which of their people so ever they do mean to send out of our kingdom into their own country , then they shall send those their people , not without our kingly majesties knowledge , to wit , those that go of pleasure without carrying any commodities with them , and they shall have a letter of pass given unto them , out of the office where the Ambassadors have always their dispatch . 
 And whosoever hath any thing to do with them in

 And in what place of all our kingdom , in what city soever they or their people shall be , and that there happen any matter of controversy , either concerning merchandise , injuries or otherwise , that they have occasion to set upon any man by law , or that any seek upon them , concerning what matter soever in all our kingdom and cities , then our lieutenants , captains , and our officers shall give them Justice , and shall minister all true justice between them , seeking out the truth : and what cannot be truly sought by law , shall sought out by other and lot : whose lot soever is taken out , him to have right accordingly as before , and the Judges or Justices shall take of them no kind of duty , for matters of law no where throughout all our realms . This letter is given in our princely palace within the city of Mosco , in the year from the foundation of the world , seven thousand fourescore and fifteene in the month of February .
