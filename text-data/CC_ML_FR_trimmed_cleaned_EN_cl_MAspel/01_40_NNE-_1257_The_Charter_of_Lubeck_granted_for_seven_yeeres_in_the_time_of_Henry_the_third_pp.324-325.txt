 The charter of Lubek granted for seven years , obtained in the one and fortieth year of Henry the third . 
 HEnry by the grace of God King of England , Lord of Ireland , Duke of Normandie and Aquitaine , and Earl of Anjou , to all his Bailiffs sends greeting . Know you that at the instant request of our well-beloved and trusty brother Richard Earl of Cornewal being of late elected king of the Romans , we have received under our protection and defence , and under our safe and secure conduct , the citizens of Lubek in Alemain , with all their goods and wares , which they shall bring or cause to be brought into our kingdom . We have also granted unto them , that of all their goods and merchandise , nothing shall be seized unto the use of our selves , or of any other without their own consent , but that they may freely fell and exercise traffic therewith , according as they shall think expedient . And therefore we straightly command you , that neither your selves do offer , nor that you permit any other to offer any impediment or molestation unto the said Burghers or unto their messengers , either at their coming into our land , with their goods and merchandise , in the time of their abided there , or at their departure from thence , and that ye neither molest them your selves , nor yet suffer them by others to be molested , contrary to the aforesaid Charter . In testimony whereof , we have caused these our Letters to be made Patents , during the space of seven years next following . 
 Provided , that the said Burghers do in the mean time behave themselves well and faithfully towards our foresaid elected brother . Witness our selves at Westminster the eleventh day of March , in the one and fortieth year of our reign . 
 This Letter was doubled , namely for the Burghers , and the Merchants of Denmarke , of Brunswig , and of Lubecke .
