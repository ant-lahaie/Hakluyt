 ELizabeth by the grace of the most mighty God , and only Creator of heaven and earth , of England , France and Ireland Queen , the most invincible and most mighty defender of the Christian faith against all kind of idolatries , of all that live among the Christians , and falsely profess the Name of Christ , unto the most Imperiali and most invincible prince , Zuldan Murad Can , the most mighty ruler of the kingdom of Turkey , sole and above all , and most sovereign Monarch of the East Empire , greeting , and many happy and fortunate years , with abundance of the best things . 
 Most Imperiali and most invincible Emperor , we have received the letters of your mighty highness written to us from Constantinople the fifteenth day of March this present year , whereby we understand how graciously , and how favorably the humble petitions of one William Hareborne a subject of ours , resident in the Imperial city of your highness presented unto your Majesty for the obtaining of access for him and two other Merchants more of his company our subject's also , to come with merchandizes both by sea and land , to the countries and territories subject to your government , and from thence again to return home with good leave and liberty , were accepted of your most invincible Imperiali highness , and not that only , but with and extraordinary speed and worthy your Imperiali grace , that which was craved by petition was granted to him , and his company in regard only ( as it seems ) of that opinion which your highness conceived of us and our amity : which singular benefit done to our aforesaid subject's , we take so thankfully , and in so good part ( yielding for the same our greatest thanks to your highness ) that we will [ n . i . 140. ] never give occasion to your said highness ( according as time , and the respect of our affairs will permit ) once to think so great a pleasure bestowed upon and ungrateful Prince . For the Almighty God , by whom , and by whose 
 175 
 grace we reign , hath planted in us this goodness of nature , that we detest and abhor the least suspicion of ingratitude , and hath taught us not to suffer our selves to be overmatched with the good demerits of other Princes . And therefore at this time we do extend our good mind unto your highness , by well conceiving , and publishing also abroad , how much we repute our self bound in and everlasting remembrance for this good pleasure to our Subject's , meaning to yield a much more large and plentiful ! testification of our thankfulness , when time convenient shall fallen out , and the same shall be looked for at our hands . 
 But whereas that grant which was given to a few of our Subject's , and at their only request without any intercession of ours , stands in as free a liberty of coming and going to and from all the lands and kingdoms subject to your Majesty , both by land & sea with merchandizes , as ever was granted to any of your Imperiali highness confederates , as namely to the French , the Polonians , the Venetians , as also to the subject's of the king of the Romans , we desire of your highness that the commendation of such singular courtesy may not be so narrowly restrained to two or three men only , but may be enlarged to all our subject's in general , that thereby your highness goodness may appear the more notable , by reason of the granting of the same to a greater number of persons . The bestowing of which so singular a benefit your highness shall so much the less repent you of , by how much the more fit and necessary for the use of man those commodities are , wherewith our kingdoms do abound , and the kingdoms of other princes do want , so ill there is no nation that can be without them , but are glad to come by them , although by very long and difficult travels : and when they have them , they fell them much dearer to others , because every man seeks to make profit by his labour : so that iin the getting of them there is profit , but in the buying of them from others there is loss . 
 176 
 But this profit will be increased to the subject's of your highness by this free access of a few of our subject's to your dominions , as also the loss and burden will eased , by the permission of general access to all our people . And frirthermore we will grant as equal and as free a liberty to the subject's of your highness with us for the use of traffic , when they will , and as often as they will , to come , and go to and from us and our kingdoms . Which liberty we promise to your highness shall as ample , and as large as any was ever given or granted to your subject's by the aforesaid princes your confederates , as namely the king of the Romans , of France , of Poland , and the common wealth of Venice . In which matter , if your most invincible Imperiali highness shall vouchsafe to incline to our reasonable request , and shall give order upon these our letters , that we may have knowledge how the same is accepted of you , and whither it will granted , with sufficient security for our subject's to go , and return safe and secure from all violences and injuries of your people , we on the other side will give order , that those commodities which Almighty God hath bestowed upon our kingdoms ( which are in deed so excellent , that by reason of them all princes are drawn to enter , and confirm leagues of amity and good neighbourhood with us , by that means to enjoy these so great blessings of God , which we have , and they can in no case want ) our subject's shall bring them so abundantly and plentifully to the kingdoms and dominions of your highness , that both the former inconveniences of necessity , and loss , shall most sufficiently be taken away . 
 Moreover the signification and assurance of your highness great affection to us and our nation , doth cause us also to entreat and use mediation on the behalf of certain of our subject's , who are detained as slaves and captives in your Galleys , for whom we crave , that forasmuch as they are fallen into that misery , not by any offence of theirs , by bearing of arms against your high - 
 v 177 M 
 ness , or in behaving of themselves contrary to honesty , and to the law of nations , they may be delivered from their bondage , and restored to liberty , for their service towards us , according to their duty : which thing shall yield much more abundant cause to us of commending your clemency , and of beseeching that God ( who only is above all things , and all men , and is a most severe revenger of all idolatry , and is jealous of his honour against the false gods of the nations ) to adorn your most invincible Imperiali highness with all the blessings of those gifts , which only and deservedly are accounted most worthy of asking . 
 Given at our palace of Greenwich , near to our City of London , the five and twentieth day of October , in the year of Jesus Christ our Saviour one thousand , five hundreth , seventie and nine , and of our reign the one and twentieth .
