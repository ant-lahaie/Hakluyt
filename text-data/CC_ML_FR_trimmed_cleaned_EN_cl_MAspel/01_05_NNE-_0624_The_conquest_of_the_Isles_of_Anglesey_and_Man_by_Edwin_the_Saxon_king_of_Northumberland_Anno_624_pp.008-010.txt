The conquest of the Isles of Anglesey and Man by Edwin the Saxon king of Northumberland written in the second Book and fift Chapter of Beda his Ecclesiastical historic of the English nation . 
 The same in English . 
 EDwin king of the people of Northumberland , that is to say , of them which inhabit to the North of the river Humber , being of greater authority then any other potentate in the whole Isle of Britaine , bore rule as well over the English as the British nation , except only the people of Kent : who also brought in subjection under the English , the Isles of Man and Anglesey , and the other Northwestern Isles of the Britons , which are situate between Britaine and Ireland . 
 Another testimony alleged by Beda to the same purpose . Lib. 2. cap . 9. 
 The same in English . 
 IN the year from the incarnation of our Lord , sixe hundreth twentie and foure , the people of Northumberland , to wit , those English people which inhabit on the North side of the river of Humber , together with their king Edwin , at the Christian preaching and persuasion of Paulinus above mentioned , embraced the Gospel . Under which king , after he had once accepted of the Christian faith , the power both of the heavenly & of his earthly kingdom was enlarged ; insomuch , that he ( which no English king had done before him ) brought under his subjection all the provinces of Britaine , which were inhabited either by the English men themselves , or by the Britons . Moreover , he subdued unto the crown of England ( as we have above signified ) the Hebrides , commonly called the Western Islands . The principali whereof being more commodiously and pleasantly seated towards the South , and more abounding with corn then the rest , containeth according to the estimation of the 
 English , room enough for 960. families , and the second for 300. and above .
