Concerning this surprise Albertus Krantzius in the sixt book of his history of Norway , and the 8. Chapter writeth in manner following . 
 IN the mean while Norway enjoyed peace under the government of a woman : until Albertus king of Suecia , who had now seven years continued in captivity under Queen Margaret , was to be set at liberty . Which , when the common soldiers of Rostok & Wismer , called The Vitalians . the Vitalians perceived , ( who , whilst their king was held captive , in the right of the forenamed cities , for the behalf of their lord the king being prince of Mekleburg by birth , undertook and waged war all the time of his captivity ) banding their forces together , they resolved , at their own costs & charges , but in the right of the said cities , to sail into the 3. kingdoms , and to take such spoils as they could lay hold on . These common soldiers therefore , seeing and end of their tyrannical and violent dealing to approach , sailed into Norway , unto the town of Norbern , being a mars town for all the merchants of Germanie : who transporting fish from thence , do bring thither merchandises of all kinds , especially corn , unto the scarcity whereof , unless it be brought out of other countries' , that kingdom ( as we have said ) is very much subject . Departing out of their ships and going on shore , they set upon the town , and by fire and sword they easily compelled the inhabitants dwelling in weak wooden houses , to give place . Thus . these Vitalians entering and surprising the town conveyed such spoils unto their ships as them pleased , and having laden their ships with those booties , they returned home frolic unto the ports of their own cities . Without all respect , they robbed and rifled the goods , aswell of the Germane , as of the Noruagians : and like lewd companions , wasting and making havoc of all things , proved themselves never the wealthier . For it is not the guise of such good fellows to store up or to preserve 68 
 ought . The citizens , at the first , seemed to be enriched : howbeit afterwards , ( no man misdoubting any such calamity ) goods ill got were worse spent . Thus far Krantzius .
