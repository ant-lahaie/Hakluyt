 Garganus a mountain of Apulia in Italic . 
 honourably entertained me , and welcomed me with rich and magnificent gifts : but especially the Emperor bestowed diverse costly presents and rewards upon me , both in vessels of gold and silver , and also in cloaks and garments of great valve . Wherefore I conferred with the Emperor himself and the Pope , and with the other Princes who were there present , concerning the necessities of all my subject's both Englishmen and Danes ; that a more favourable law & secure peace in their way to Room might be granted unto them , and that they might not be hindered by so many stops & impediments in their journey , and wearied by reason of injust exactions . And the Emperor condescended unto my request , and King Rodulphus also , who hath greatest authority over the foresaid stops and straights , and all the other princes confirmed by their Edicts , that my subject's , as well Merchants , as others who travailed for devotions sake , should without all hinder - 
 ance and restraint of the foresaid stops and customers , 
 go unto Room in peace , and return from thence in 
 safety .
