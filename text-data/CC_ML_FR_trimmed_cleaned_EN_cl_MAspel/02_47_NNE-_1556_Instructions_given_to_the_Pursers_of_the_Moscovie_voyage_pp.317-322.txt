 2 Also when the ship begins to lade , you shall be ready a board with your book , to enter such goods as shall be brought aboard , to be laden for the company , packed , or unpacked , taking the marks and numbers of every pack , farthel , truss , or packet , corovoya , chest , fat , butt , pipe , puncheon , whole barrel , half barrel , firken , or other cask , mand , or basket , or any other thing , which may , or shall be packed by any other manner of ways or devise . And 
 317 
 first , all such packs , or trusses , etc. as shall be brought aboard to be laden , not marked by the companies mark , you shall do the best to let that the same be not laden , and to inquire diligently to know the owners thereof , if you can , and what commodity the same is , that is so brought aboard to be laden : if you can not know the owners of such goods , learn what you can thereof , as well making a note in your book , as also to send or bring word thereof to the Agent , and to some one of the foure Merchants with him adjoined so speedily as you can , if it be here laden or to be laden in this river , being not marked with the companies mark , as is aforesaid : and when the said ship hath received in all that the companies Agent will have laden , you shall make a just copy of that which is laden , reciting the parcels , the marks and numbers of every thing plainly , which you shall likewise deliver to the said bookekeeper to the use aforesaid . 
 3 Also when the ship is ready to depart , you shall come for your cockets and letters to the Agent , and shall show him all such letters as you have received of any person or persons privately or openly , to be delivered to any person or persons in Russia or elsewhere , and also to declare if you know any other that shall pass in the ship either master or mariner that hath received any letters to be privily delivered to any there , directed from any person or persons , other then from the Agent here to the Agent there : which letters so by you received , you shall not carry with you , without you be licenced so to do by the Agent here , and some of the foure merchant's , as is aforesaid : and such others as do pass , having received any privy letters to be delivered , you shall all that in you lies , let the delivery of them at your arriving in Russia : and also if you have or do receive , or shall know any other that does or hath received any goods or ready money to be employed in Russia , or to be delivered there to any person or 318 
 persons from any person or persons , other then such as be the companies goods , and that under their mark , you shall before the ship doth depart , declare the same truly to the said Agent , and to some of the other merchant's to him adjoined , as it is before declared . 
 4 Also when the ship is ready to depart , and hath the master and the whole company aboard , you shall diligently foresee and take heed , that there pass not any privy person or persons , other then such as be authorized to pass in the said ship , without the licence and warrant of one of the Governors and of the assistants , for the same his passage , to be first showed . And if there be any such person or persons that is to pass and will pass without showing the same warrant , you shall let the passage of any such to the uttermost of your power : And for that there may no such privy person pass under the cloak and colour of some mariner , you shall upon the weighin of your ships anchor , call the master and the mariners within board by their names and that by your books , to the end that you may see that you have neither more nor less , but just the number for the voyage . 
 5 Also you must have in remembrance , that if it shall chance the ship to be put into any harbour in this coast by contrary winds or otherwise in making the voyage , to send word thereof from time to time as the case shall require , by your letters in this manner . To master I . B. Agent for the company of the New trades in S. in London : If you do hire any to bring your letters , write that which he must have for the portage . And for your better knowledge and learning , you shall do very well to keep a daily note of the voyage both outward and homeward . 
 6 And principally see that you forget not daily in all the voyage both morning and evening , to call the company within board to prayer , in which doing you shall please God , and the voyage will have the better success thereby , and the company prosper the better . 
 319 
 7 Also in calm weather and at other times when you shall fortune to come to anchor in the seas during the voyage , you shall for the companies profit , and for the good husbanding of the victuals aboard , call upon the Boateswaine and other of the company to use such hooks and other engines as they have aboard to take fish with , that such fish so taken may be eaten for the cause aforesaid : and if there be no such engines aboard , then to provide some before you go from hence . 
 8 And when God shall send you in safety into the Bay of S. Nicholas at and anchor , you shall go a shore with the first boat that shall depart from the ship , taking with you such letters as you have to deliver to the Agent there : and if he be not there at your coming a land , then send the companies letters to Colmogro to him by some sure mariner or otherwise , as the master and you shall think best , but go not your self at any hand , nor yet from aboard the ship , unless it be a shore to treat with the Agent for the lading of the ship that you be appointed in , which you shall apply diligently to have done so speedily as may be . And for the discharging of the goods therein in the Bay , to be carried from thence , see that you do look well to the unlading thereof , that there be none other goods sent a shore then the companies , and according to the notes entered in your book as is aforesaid : if there be , inquire diligently for whom they be , and what goods they be , noting who is the receiver of the said goods , in such sort that the company may have the true knowledge thereof at your coming home . 
 9 Also there a shore , and likewise aboard , you shall spy and search as secretly as you may , to learn and know what bargaining , . buying and selling there is with the master and the mariners of the ship and the Russes , or with the companies servants there : and that which you shall perceive and learn , you shall keep a note thereof in your book secretly to your self , which you shall open and disclose at your coming home to 
 320 
 the governors and assistants , in such sort as the truth of their secret trades and occupyings may be revealed and known . You shall need always to have Argos eyes , to spy their secret packing and conveyance , aswell on land as aboard the ship , of and for such furs and other commodities , as yearly they do use to buy , pack and convey hither . If you will be vigilant and secret in this article , you cannot miss to spy their privy packing one with another , either on shore or aboard the ship : work herein wisely , and you shall deserve great thanks of the whole company . 
 io Also at the lading again of the ship , you shall continue and abide aboard , to the end that you may note and write in your book all such goods and merchandises as shall be brought and laden , which you shall orderly note in all sorts as heretofore , as in the second article partly it is touched : and in any wise put the Master and the company in remembrance , to look and foresee substantially to the roomaging of the ship , by fair means or threats , as you shall see and think will serve for the best . 
 11 Thus when the ship is full laden again , and all things aboard in good order , and that you do fortune to go a shore to the Agent for your letters , and dispatch away : you shall demand whither all the goods be laden that were brought thither , and to know the truth thereof , you shall repair to the companies storehouse there at S. Nicholas , to see if there be any goods left in the said storehouse : if there be , you shall demand why they be not laden , and note what kind of goods they be that be so left : and seeing any of the ships there not fully laden , you shall put the Agent in remembrance to lade those goods so left , if any such be to be laden , as is aforesaid . And thus God sending you a fair wind , to make speed and away . 
 12 Finally , when God shall send you to arrive again upon this coast in safety , either at Harewich , or else-n 321 x 
 where , go not you aland , if you may possibly , to the end that when you be gone a shore , there may no goods be sent privily ashore to be sold , or else to be sold aboard the ship in your absence , but keep you still aboard , if you can by any means , for the causes aforesaid , and write the company a letter from the ship of your good arrival , which you may convey to them by land by some boy or mariner of the ship , or otherwise as you shall think best : and likewise when God shall send you and the ship into the river here , do not in any wise depart out of the ship that you be in , until the company do send some other aboard the ship , in your steed and place , to keep the ship in your absence .
