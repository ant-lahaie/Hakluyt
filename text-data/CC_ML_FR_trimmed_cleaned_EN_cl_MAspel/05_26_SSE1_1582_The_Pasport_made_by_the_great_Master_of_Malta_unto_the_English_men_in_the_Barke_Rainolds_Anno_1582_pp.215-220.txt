 archbishop's , bishops , Dukes , Marquesses , Barons , Captains , Vicelords , Majors , Castellans , Admirals , and whatsoever patrons of Galleys , or other greater ships , and governors of cities , potentates and magistrates , and other officers and persons whatsoever , of what dignity , degree , state and condition soever they be , dwelling in all places and lands , greeting . 
 We make it known , and in the word of truth do witness , that in the month of May last past , our galleys came on the voyage from Barbarie , where having commandment to succour a little ship of the Christians which was driven over into that part , being arrived upon this Hand on the West part they found one English ship under the charge of the worshipful John Keel , and David Filly master : and our men willing to know what ship it was , they seemed to put themselves in order for their defence , doubting that the said our galleys were of the enemies , & therefore one mariner attempted contrary to the will of the worshipful John Keel , and David Filly master , and had shot off a piece of artillery against one of the said galleys , and because she would not strike amain her sail , according to the will of the said worshipful John Keel , and David Filly master , the said ship was brought back again unto the present port of Malta , according to the order of the reverend general of the said galleys : and in being there , master Inquisitor stayed it by authority of the holy office , and in that behalf by the holy ness of our Lord pope Gregorie the thirteenth , in the end was licenced to depart on her voyage . They therefore the said worshipful John Keel and David Filly , in the name and behalf of the worshipful master Edward Osborne Aiderman , and Richard Staper , English merchants of the noble city of London , have humbly besought together with Thomas Wilkinson the purser , pilots , master and mariners , that we would give our letters patents , and safe conducts , that they might go and return , when they shall see opportunity , with their goods and merchandizes at their pleasure : whereupon the

 A PASSPORT TO ENGLISHMEN thing seeming unto us just , and that it might be for the profit of our religion , and of these strangers , by the tenor of these presents we have granted the same to them : yet , with the conditions hereunder written , viz. 
 That every time the said merchants of the said ship , or with any other , shall not bring such merchandise as is forbidden , and that by sufficient proof and letters testimoniali it appears that they are free from the infections of the plague , they may victuali themselves with all necessary victuals , and traffic with us , and in this Hand and dominion , and afterward may depart and follow their voyage whither they will into the Levant or else where , as all other vessels , and especially of France and other nations do , and fell and buy whatsoever merchandise they shall think good . 
 Item , that they may bring powder for cannon and harquebus , saltpeter , coal of Newcastle , plataeae of latin , tin , Steel , iron , common karsies white , course canvas to make sail for the galleys , balls of iron for shot , fine millstones , trees & masts for galleys , little and others , and in conclusion , having seen that they for the time of their abided here , did behave themselves like faithful and catholic Christians , & that his holiness hath allowed the safeconduct of the great Turke to them granted for fear of the Turkish army , and other vessels of the enemy , submitting our selves to the pleasures of his holiness , and especially because our people have occasion to pass by diverse places so far off , as England , Flanders , and all parts Westwards , and in other places , we have vouchsafed to make these our letters patents , as our faithful assistant , so as more surely , and without let they may go and return when they shall think good , with the said ship or with others at their pleasure . We therefore pray all and every of your subject's effectually that by what part soever of your jurisdiction , unto the which the said worshipful John Keel and David Filly by name abovesaid , with the ship and mariners of the said principali place or other , shall have access , sail , & 219 
 pass , and come safely with liberty without any disturbance or other impediment , that you give leave , and cause leave to be given that they may pass , stay and return , and when they please , depart , in such sort , that for our love & contentation the said worshipful John Keel , with the ship and mariners have no let , hindrance , or retention , also that you give all help and favour , a thing worthy of your justice , and to us most acceptable , to be recompensed with equal and greater service , when upon occasion it shall required . 
 And finally , we command all , and whatsoever religious people , and brother's of our religion , of whatsoever condition , degree , and state they be , and all other receivers and procurators , in all and whatsoever our priories deputed , and to be deputed by virtue of the holy obedience , and all our people , and all that are subject to the jurisdiction of our religion , that in , and by the same they hold , and repute the said worshipful John Keel in the name as abovesaid , the ship , mariners , and merchandise , without let in the same their voyage , or in any other place , that they be not molested , nor in any wise hindered , but that in all their causes and business they be of you helped , and furthered continually . In witness whereof , our seal of government is impressed to these presents in black wax . Given at Malta in our Convent , the twelfth of the month of July , in the year 1582.
