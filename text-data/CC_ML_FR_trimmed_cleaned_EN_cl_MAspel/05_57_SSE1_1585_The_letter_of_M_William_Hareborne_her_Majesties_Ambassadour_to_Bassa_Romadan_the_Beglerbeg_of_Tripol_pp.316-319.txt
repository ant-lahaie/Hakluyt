 317 
 [ II i . 194. ] 
 Right honourable Lord , it hath be signified unto us by diverse letters , what hath fallen out , concerning a certain ship of ours , called the Jesus , into which , for the help of Richard Skegs , one of our Merchants in the same , now deceased , there was admitted a certain Frenchman called Roman Sonnings , which for his ill behaviour , according to his deserts , seeking to carry away with him another Frenchman , which was indebted to certain of your people , without paying his cteditours , was hanged by sentence of justice , together with Andrew Dier , the Master of the said ship , who simply and without fraud , giving credit to the said Frenchman , without any knowledge of his evil fact , did not return when he was commanded , by your honourable Lordship . The death of the said lewd Frenchman we approve as a thing well done , but contrariwise , whereas your Lordship hath confiscated the said ship with the goods therein , and hath made slaves of the Mariners , as a thing altogether contrary to the privileges of the Grand Signior , granted foure years since , and confirmed by us on the behalf of the most excellent the Queens Majesty of England our Mistress , and altogether contrary to the league of the said Grand Signior , who being fully informed of the aforesaid cause , hath granted unto us his royal commandment of restitution , which we send unto your honourable Lordship , by the present bearer Edward Barton our Secretary , and Mahomet Beg , one of the Justices of his stately Court , with other letters of the most excellent Admiral , and most valiant Captain of the Sea , requiring your honourable Lordship , as well on the behalf of the Grand Signior , as of the Queens most excellent Majesty my Mistress , that the men , oils , ship , furniture , money , and all other goods whatsoever , by your Lordship , and your order taken from our men , be restored unto this my Secretary freely , without delay , as the Grand Signior of his goodness hath granted 318 
 unto us , especially in regard that the same oils were bought by the commandment of our Queens most excellent Majesty , for the provision of her Court . Which if you perform not , we protest by these our letters against you , that you are the cause of all the inconveniences which may ensue upon this occasion , as the author thereof , contrary to the holy league sworn by both our Princes , as by the privileges , which this our servant will show you , may appear . For the seeing of which league performed , we remain here as Ligier in this stately Court . And by this means you shall answer in another world unto God alone , and in this world unto the Grand Signior , for this heinous sin committed by you against so many poor souls , which by this your cruelty are in part dead , and in part detained by you in most miserable captivity . Contrariwise , if it shall please you to avoid this mischief , and to remain in the favour of Almighty God , and of our Princes , you shall friendly fulfil this our just demand ( as it behooveth you to show your self a prudent Governor , and faitbfull servant unto your Lord ) and the same may turn to your great honour , and profit , by the trade of merchandise , which our men in time to come , may use in that government of yours : which generally , as well those poor men , as all others , which you shall meet at the sea , ought to be according to the commandment of the Grand Signior , friendly entertained and received of your honourable Lordship , and we will not fade in the duties of a speciali friend , whensoever you shall have occasion to use us , as we desire . Almighty God grant unto your Lordship ( in the fulfilling of this our just request , whereby we may be delivered from further trouble in this matter , and your self from further displeasure ) all true felicity , and increase of honour . 
 Given in our Palace from Rapamat in Pera , the 15. of Januarie 1585.
