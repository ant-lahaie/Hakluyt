A letter to the right honourable William Hareborne her Majesties Ambassador with the Grand Signior from Alger . 
 Right honourable , we have received your honours letters dated in Constantinople the 5 of November , and accordingly delivered that enclosed to the king of this place , requiring of him , according as you did command us in her Majesties name , that he would vouchsafe to give 
 order to all his Captains & Rajes that none of them should meddle with our English ships coming or going to or from these parts , for that they have order not to pass by the Christian coast , but upon the coast of Barbary , and showing him of the charter given by the Grand Signior , requiring him in like case that for the better fulfilling of the amity , friendship and holy league 263 
 between the Grand Signior and her Majesty , he would give us five or six safe-conducts for our ships , that meeting with any of his galleys or galliots , they might not meddle with them neither shoot at them : who made me answer he would neither give me any safe conduct nor commission to his men of war not to meddle with them , for that he trusted to take some of them this year , and made good account thereof . In like manner I spoke to the chief of the Janisers and the Levents , who made me answer , the best hope they had this year was to take some of them , and although they have the Grand Signiors commandment we care not therefore : for we will by policy , or one means or other provoke them to shoot some ordinance , which if they do but one piece , the peace is broken , and they be good prizes . And some of them say further , we care not for their safeconduct , for if they show it us , we will convey it away , we are sure the dogs cannot be believed against us . The premises considered , your honour is with all speed to procure the Grand Signior his favourable letters directed to Hazan , the Cady , Captains , Janisers , & Levents , & another like to Romadan Bassa , king of Tripolis , commanding them in no manner whatsoever to deal with our English ships bound into those parts or returning thence with their commodities , although they should shoot one at another : for when our ships shall meet them , for that , as your honour is advertised , the galleys of Carthagena , Florence , Sicilia and Malta have made a league to take all our ships coming in or going out of the Grand Signiors dominions , therefore if they meet with any of these galleys of Alger or Tripolis , thinking they be of them , and not knowing them a far off , they may shoot at them , which if therefore they should make them prizes , were against Gods laws , the Grand Signior his league , all reason and conscience , considering that all the world does know that Merchants ships laden with merchandise do not seek to fight with men of war , but contrariwise to defend themselves from them , when they would do

Wherefore if your honour do not get out [ II i . 174. ] two letters of the Grand Signior as aforesaid , & send them hither with all speed by some one of your gentlemen accompanied with a chaus of the Court , or some other of the Grand Signiors servants , it is impossible that our English ships can escape freely from these or the Christians : for either they must of force go on the Christian coast , and so fallen into their hands , or else on this coast , and fallen into the kings of this town , or Tripolis , their hands , which if they should , will never be recovered . And if your honour cannot obtain this thing , I beseech your honour in the behalf of all the English merchants ( who sent me hither to follow such order as your honour should give me ) to certify her Majesty , to the end that they may be commanded to leave off traffic , and not to loose their goods , and her poor subject's the Mariners . And thus humbly taking my leave , I desist from troubling your honour . From Algier the tenth of February 1583.
