The antiquity of the trade with English ships into the Levant . 
 N the years of our Lord , 1511. 1512. etc. till the year 1534. diverse tall ships of London , namely , The Christopher Campion , wherein was Factor one Roger Whitcome ; the Mary George , wherein was Factor William Gresham ; the great Marry Grace , the Owner whereof , was 
 William Gunson , and the master one John Hely ; the Trinitie Fitzwilliams , whereof was master Laurence Arkey ; the Mathew of London , whereof was master William Capling , with certain other ships of Southampton and Bristow , had and ordinary and usual trade to Sicilia , Candie , Chio , and somewhiles to Cyprus , as also to Tripolis and Barutti in Syria . The commodities which they carried thither were fine Kersies of diverse colours , course Kersies , white Western dozens , Cottons , 62 
 certain clothes called Statutes , and others called Cardinalwhites , and Calveskins which were well sold in Sicilie , etc. The commodities which they returned back were Silks , Chamlets , Rubarbe , Malmesies , Muskadels and other wines , sweet oils , cotton wool , Turkey carpets , Galls , Pepper , Cinamom , and some other spices , etc. Beside , the natural inhabitants of the foresaid places , they had , even in those days , traffic with Jewes , Turkes , and other foreigners . Neither did our merchant's only employ their own English shipping before mentioned , but sundry strangers also : as namely , Candiots , Raguseans , Sicilians , Genouezes , Venetian galliasses , Spanish and Portugale ships . All which particulars do most evidently appear out of certain ancient Ligier books of the R. W. Sir William Lock Mercer of London , of Sir William Bowyer Aiderman of London , of master John Gresham , and of others ; which I Richard Hakluyt have diligently perused and copied out . And here for authorities sake I do annex , as a thing not impertinent to this purpose , a letter of king Henry the eight , unto DONE John the third , king of Portugale .
