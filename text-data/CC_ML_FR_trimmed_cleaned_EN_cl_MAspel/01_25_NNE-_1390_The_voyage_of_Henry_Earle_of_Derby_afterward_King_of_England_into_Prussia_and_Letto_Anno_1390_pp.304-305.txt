The voyage of Henry Earl of Derbie , after Duke of Hereford , and lastly king of England , by the name of Henry the fourth , An. Dom. 1390. into Prussia and Lettowe , against the infidels , recorded by Thomas of Walsingham . 
 A Bout the same time L. Henry the Earl of Derbie travailed into Prussia , where , with the help of the Marshal of the same Province , and of a certain king called Wytot , he vanquished the army of the king of Lettowe , with the captivity of foure Lithuanian Dukes , and the slaughter of three , beside more then three hundred of the principali common soldiers of the said army which were slain . The City also which is called Wil or Vilna , into the castle whereof the king of Lettow nam Skirgalle fled for his safeguard , was , by the valour of the said Earl especially and of his followers , surprised and taken . For certain of the chief men of his family , while others were slothful or at least ignorant of their intent , scaling the walls , advanced his colours thereupon . And there were taken and slain foure thousand of the common soldiers , and among others was slain the king of Poland his brother , who was our professed enemy . And the castle of the foresaid City was besieged for the space of five weeks : but by reason of the infirmities and inconveniences wherewith the whole army was annoyed , the great master's of Prussia and of Lifland would not stay any longer . There were converted of the nation of Lettowe eight persons unto the Christian faith . And the master of Lifland carried home with him into his country three thousand captives .
