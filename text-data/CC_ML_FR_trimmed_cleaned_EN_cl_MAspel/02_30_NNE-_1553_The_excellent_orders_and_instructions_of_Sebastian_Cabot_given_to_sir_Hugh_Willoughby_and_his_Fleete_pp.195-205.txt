 25 Item our people may not pass further into a land , then that they may be able to recover their pinnaces , or ships , & not to credit the fair words of the strange people , which be many times tried subtle , and false , nor to be drawn into peril of loss , for the desire of gold , silver , or riches , and esteem your own commodities above all other , and in countenance show not much to desire the foreign commodities : nevertheless take them as for friendship , or by way of permutation .

 203 
 likelihood of success in the voyage , passing such dangers of the seas , perils of ice , intolerable colds , and other impediments , which by sundry authors & writers , have ministered matter of suspicion in some heads , that this voyage could not succeed for the extremi tie of the North pole , lack of passage , & such , like , which have caused wavering minds , and doubtful heads , not only to withdraw themselves from the adventure of this voyage , but also dissuaded others from the same , the certainty whereof , when you shall have tried by experience , ( most certain Master of all worldly knowledge ) then for declaration of the truth , which you shall have experted , you may by common assent of counsel , send either by land , or otherways , such two or one person , to bring the same by credit , as you shall think may pass in safety : which sending is not to be done , but upon urgent causes , in likely success of the voyage , in finding of passage , in towardliness of beneficial traffic , or such other like , whereby the company being advertised of your estates and proceedings , may further provide , foresee , and determine that which may seem most good and beneficial for the public wealth of the same : either providing before hand such things , as shall be requisite for the continuance of the voyage , or else otherwise to dispose as occasion shall serve : in which things your wisdoms and discretions are to be used , and showed , and the contents of this capitule , by you much to be pondered , for that you be not ignorant , how many persons , as well the kings Majesty , the Lords of his honourable Counsel , this whole company , as also your wives , children , kinsfolks , allies , friends and familiars , be replenished in their hearts with ardent desire to learn and know your estates , conditions , and welfares , and in what likelihood you be in , to obtain this notable enterprise , which is hoped no less to succeed to you , then the Orient or Occident Indias have to the high benefit of the Emperor , and kings of Portingal , whose subject's industries , and travails by sea , have enriched them , by those lands and Islands , which were to 
 204 
 i553-all Cosmographers , and other writers both unknown , and also by appearances of reason void of experience thought Reason void and reputed unhabitable for extremities of heats , and °feKPer^nce-colds , and yet indeed tried most rich , peopled , temperate , and so commodious , as all Europe hath not the like . 
 33 Item not conspiracies , parttakings , factions , false tales , untrue reports , which be the very seeds , and fruits of contention , discord , & confusion , by evil tongues to be suffered , but the same , & all other ungodliness to be chastened charitably with brotherly love , and always obedience to be used and practised by all persons in their degrees , not only for duty and conscience sake towards God , under whose merciful hand navigants above all other creatures naturally be most nigh , and vicine , but also for prudent and worldly policy , and public weal , considering and always having present in your minds that you be all one most royal kings subject's , and naturals , with daily remembrance of the great importance of the voyage , the honour , glory , praise , and benefit that depend of , and upon the same , towards the common wealth of this noble Realm , the advancement of you the travelers therein , your wives , and children , and so to endeavour your selves as that you may satisfy the expectation of them , who at their great costs , charges , and expenses , have so furnished you in good sort , and plenty of all necessaries , as the like was never in any realm seen , used , or known requisite and needful for such and exploit , which is most likely to be achieved , and brought to good effect , if every person in his vocation shall endeavour himself according to his charge , and most bounden duty : praying the living God , to give you his grace , to accomplish your charge to his glory , whose merciful hand shall prosper your voyage , and preserve you from all dangers .
