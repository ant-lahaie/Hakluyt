A note of the proceeding of M. Anthonie Jenkinson , Ambassador from the Queens most excellent Majesty , to the Emperor of Russia , from the time of his arrival there , being the 26. of July 1571 , until his departure from thence the 23. of July 1572. 
 He said 26. day I arrived with the two good ships called the Swallow and the Harry in safety , at the Bay of S. Nicholas in Russia aforesaid , and landed at Rose Island , from whence immediately I sent away my interpreter Daniel Silvester in post towards the Court , 
 being then at the Mosco , whereby his majesty might as well be advertised of my arrival in his Dominions , as also to know his highness pleasure for my further access . And remaining at the said Island two or three days , to have conference with your Agent about your affairs , I did well perceive by the words of the said Agent and others your servants , that I was entered into 
 170 
 great peril and danger of my life : for they reported to me that they herd said at the Mosco , that the princes displeasure was such against me , that if ever I came into his country again , I should lose my head , with other words of discouragement . Whereat I was not a little dismayed , not knowing whither it were best for me to proceed forward , or to return home again with the ships for the safeguard of my life . But calling to mind mine innocence and good meaning , and knowing my self not to have offended his Majesty any manner of ways either in word or deed , or by making former promises not performed , heretofore by mine enemies falsely surmised : and being desirous to come to the trial thereof , whereby to justify my true dealings , and to reprove my said enemies as well here as there , who have not ceased of late by untrue reports to impute the cause of the said Emperor's displeasure towards you to proceed of my dealings , and promises made to him at my last being with him ( although by his letters to the Queens Majesty , and by his own words to me the contrary doth appear ) I determined with my self rather to put my life into his hands , & by the providence of God to prosecute the charge committed unto me , then to return home in vain , discouraged with the words of such , who had rather that I had tarried at home , then to be sent over with such credit , whereby I might sift out their evil doings , the only cause of your loss . 
 Wherefore , leaving the said ships the nine and twentieth day of the month , I departed from the seaside , and the first of August arrived at Colmogro , where I remained attending the return of my said messenger with order from his Majesty . 
 But all the Country being soar visited by the hand of God with the plague , passage in every place was shut up , that none might pass in pain of death : My messenger being eight hundreth miles upon his way , was stayed , and kept at a town called Shasko , and might not be suffered to go any further , neither yet to return 
 171 
 back again , or send unto me : by means wnereof in the space of foure months , I could neither hear nor know what was become of him , in which time my said messenger found means to advertise the Governor of the Ci tie of Vologda , as well of his stay , as of the cause of his coming thither , who sent him word that it was not possible to pass any nearer the Prince without further order from his Majesty , who was gone to the wars against the Swethens , and that he would advertise his highness as soon as he might conveniently : And so my said messenger was forced to remain there still without answer . During which time of his stay through the great death ( as aforesaid , ) I found means to send another messenger , with a guide by and unknown way through wilderness , a thousand miles about , thinking that way he should pass without let : but it proved contrary , for likewise he being passed a great part of his journey , fell into the hands of a watch , and escaped very hardly , that he and his guide with their horses had not be burned , according to the law provided for such as would seek to pass by indirect ways , and many have felt the smart thereof which had not wherewith to buy out the pain : neither could that messenger return back unto me . 
 And thus was I kept without answer or order from his Majesty , and remained at the said Colmogro , until the 18. of January following , neither having a Gentleman to safeguard me , nor lodging appointed me , nor allowance of victuals according to the Country fashion for Ambassadors , which argued his grievous displeasure towards our nation . And the people of the Country perceiving the same , used towards me and my company some discourtesies : but about the 28. day aforesaid , the plague ceased , and the passages being opened , there came order from his Majesty that I should have post horses , and be suffered to depart from Colmogro to go to a City called Peraslave near to the Court , his Majesty being newly returned from the said wars . 
 172 
 And I arrived at the said Peraslave the 3. of February , where I remained under the charge of a gentleman , having then a house appointed me , & allowance of victuals , but so straitly kept , that none of our nation or other might come or send unto me , nor I to them . And the 14. of March following , I was sent for to the Court , and being within three miles of the same , a post was sent to the Gentleman which had charge of me , to return back again with me to the said Peraslave , and to remain there until his Majesties further pleasure , wherewith I was much dismayed , and marveiled what that sudden change meant , and the rather , because it was a troublesome time , and his Majesty much disquieted through the ill success of his affairs , ( as I did understand . ) And the twentieth of the same , I was sent for again to the Court , and the 23. I came before his Majesty , who caused me to kiss his hand , and gave gracious audience unto my Oration , gratefully receiving and accepting the Queens Majesties princely letters , and her present , in the presence of all his nobility . After I had finished my Oration , too long here to rehearse , and delivered her highness letters , and present ( as aforesaid ) the Emperor sitting in royal estate stood up and said , How does Queen Elizabeth my sister , is she in health ? to whom I answered , God does bless her Majesty with health , and peace , and doth wish the like unto thee Lord , her loving brother . Then his Majesty sitting down again , commanded all his nobility and others to depart , and avoid the chamber , saving the chief Secretary , and one other of the Counsel , and willing me to approach near unto him with my Interpretor , said unto me these words . 
 Anthony , the last time thou wast with us here , we did commit unto thee our trusty and secret Message , to be declared unto the Queens Majesty herself thy Mistress at thy coming home , and did expect thy coming unto us again at the time we appointed , with a full answer of the same from her highness . 
 173 
 And in the mean time there came unto us at several ! times three messengers , the one called Manly , the other George Middleton , and Edward Goodman , by the way of the Narve about the Merchant's affairs : to whom we sent our messenger to know whither thou Anthony , were returned home in safety , and when thou shouldst return unto us again : but those messengers could tell us nothing , and did miscall , and abuse with evil words , both our messenger and thee , wherewith we were much offended . And understanding that the said Goodman had letters about him , we caused him to be searched , with whom were found many letters , wherein was written much against our Princely estate , and that in our Empire were many unlawful things done , whereat we were much grieved , & would suffer none of those rude messengers to have access unto us : and shortly after we were informed that one Thomas Randolfe was come into our Dominions by the way of Dwina , Ambassador from the Queen , and we sent a Gentleman to meet and conduct him to our City of Mosco , at which time we looked that thou shouldst have returned unto us again . And the said Thomas being arrived at our said City , we sent unto him diverse times , that he should come and confer with our Counsel ! , whereby we might understand the cause of his coming , looking for answer of those our princely affairs committed unto thee . But he refused to come to our said Counsel : wherefore , and for that our said City was visited with plague , the said Thomas was the longer kept from our presence . Which being ceased , forthwith we gave him access and audience , but all his talk with us was about Merchant's affairs , and nothing touching ours . we know that Merchant's matters are to be herd , for that they are the stay of our Princely treasures : But first Princes affairs are to be established , and then Merchant's . After this the said Thomas Randolfe was with us at our City of Vologda , and we dealt with him about our Princely affairs , 174 
 whereby amity betwixt the Queens Majesty and us might be established for ever , and matters were agreed and concluded betwixt your Ambassador and us , and thereupon we sent our Ambassador into England with him to end the same : but our Ambassador returned unto us again , without finishing our said affairs , contrary to our expectation , and the agreement betwixt us , and your said Ambassador . 
 Thus when his Majesty had made a long discourse , I humbly beseeched his highness to hear me graciously , and to give me leave to speak without offence , and to believe those words to be true which I should speak . Which he granted , and these were my words . 
 Most noble and famous Prince , the message which thy highness did send by me unto the Queen her most excellent Majesty touching thy Princely and secret affairs , immediately , and so soon as I came home , I did declare both secretly and truly unto the Queens Majesty her self , word for word , as thou Lord didst command me . Which her highness did willingly hear and accept , and being mindful thereof , and willing to answer the same , the next shipping after , her Majesty did send unto thee , Lord , her highness Ambassador Thomas Randolfe , whose approved wisdom and fidelity was unto her Majesty well known , and therefore thought meet to be sent to so worthy a Prince , who had Commission not only to treat with thy Majesty of Merchant's affairs , but also of those thy Princely and secret affairs committed unto me . And the cause ( most gracious Prince ) that I was not sent again , was , for that I was employed in service upon the Seas against the Queens Majesties enemies , and was not returned home at such time as Master Thomas Randolfe departed with the Ships , to come into thy Majesties Country , otherwise I had be sent . And whereas thy Majesty says , that Thomas Randolfe would not treat with thy Counsel of the matters of his Legation , he did ( Lord ) therein according to his Com-175 
 mission : which was : First to deal with thy Majesty thy self , which order is commonly used among all Princes , when they send their Ambassadors about matters of great weight . And whereas the said Thomas is charged that he agreed and concluded upon matters at the same time , and promised the same should be performed by the Queen her Majesty : Whereupon ( Lord ) thou didst send thy Ambassador with him into England , for answer thereof : It may please thy Majesty to understand , that as the said Thomas Randolfe doth confess , that in deed he had talk with thy Highness , and counsel diverse times about princely affairs : even so he denieth that ever he did agree , conclude , or make any promise in any condition or order , as is alleged , otherwise then it should please the Queen her Majesty to like of at his return home , which he did justify to thy Highness Ambassador his face in England . Wherefore , most mighty Prince , it does well appear , that either thy Ambassador did untruly inform thy Majesty , or else thy princely mind , and the true meaning of the Queens highness her Ambassador , for want of a good Interpretor , was not well understood : and how thankfully the Queen her Majesty did receive thy highness commendations , and letters sent by thy Majesties Ambassador , and how graciously she gave him audience sundry times , using him with such honour in all points for thy sake , Lord , her loving brother , as the like was never showed to any Ambassador in our Realm , and how honourably with full answer in all things , her Majesty dismissed him , when he had finished all thy princely affairs ( as it seemed ) to his own contentation , it may well appear by a true certificate lately sent with her highness letter unto thee Lord , by her messenger Robert Beast , and her Majesty did suppose that that thy Ambassador would have made report accordingly , and that by him thy highness would have be satisfied in all things : otherwise she would have sent her Majesties Ambassador with 
 176 
 him unto thee Lord again . But now her highness perceiving that thy Majesty is not fully satisfied in thy Princely affairs , neither by Thomas Randolfe , her highness Ambassador , nor by thine own Ambassador Andrea - AndrewSavin Savin , nor yet by her Majesties letter sent by the said - Ambauadour Andrea : and also understanding thy great grief and 6 displeasure towards sir William Garret , and his company , merchant's trafficking in thy Majesties dominions , hath thought good to send me at this present unto thee Lord Emperor , and great duke , as well with her highness fill mind , touching thy princely aflaires , as also to know the just cause of thy Majesties said displeasure towards the said company of merchant's : and hath commanded me to answer to all things in their behalf , and according to their true meanings . For her highness does suppose thy Majesties indignation to proceed rather upon the evil , and untrue reports of thy late Ambassador in England , and of such wicked persons of our nation resident here in thy highness dominions , rebels to her Majesty , and their Country , then of any just deserts of the said merchant's , who never willingly deserved thy highness displeasure , but rather favour in all their doings and meanings . And since the first time of their trafiik-ing in thy Majesties dominions , which is now nineteene years , the said merchant's have be , and are always ready and willing truly to serve thy highness of all things meet for thy Treasury , in time of peace and of war in despite of all thy enemies : although the Princes of the East Seas were agreed to stop the found , and the way to the Narve , and have brought , and do bring from time to time such commodity to thee , Lord , as her Majesty doth not suffer to be transported forth of her Realm to no other Prince of the world . And what great losses the said sir William Garret , with his company hath sustained of late years in this trade , as well by Shipwreck , as by false servants it is manifestly known : and what service the said companies Ships did unto thy Majesty against thy enemies , two years passed 
 III 177 M 
 in going to the Narve , when they fought with the king of Poles ships Freebooters , and burned the same and slew the people , and as many as were taken alive delivered unto thy Captain at the Narve , I trust thy highness does not forget . Wherefore most mighty prince , the premises considered , the Queen her most excellent Majesty thy loving sister , doth request thy highness to restore the said sir William Garret with his company into thy princely favour again , with their privileges for free traffic with thy accustomed goodness and justice , to be ministered unto them throughout all thy Majesties dominions , as aforetime : and that the same may be signified by thy Princely letters , directed to thy officers in all places , and thy highness commandment or restraint to the contrary notwithstanding . And further that it will please thy Majesty , not to give credit to false reports , and untrue suggestions of such as are enemies , and such as neither would have mutual amity to continue betwixt your Majesties , nor yet intercourse betwixt your countries . And such rebels of our nation , as Ralfe Rutter , and others which lie lurking here in thy highness dominions , seeking to sow dissensions betwixt your Majesties by false surmises , spending away their master's goods riotously , and will not come home to give up their accounts , advancing themselves to be merchant's , and able to serve thy highness of all things fit for thy treasury , whereas indeed they be of no credit , nor able of themselves to do thy Majesty any service at all : the Queens highness request is , that it would please thy Majesty to command that such persons may be delivered unto me to be carried home , lest by their remaining here , and having practises and friendship with such as be not thy highness friends , their evil doing might be a cause hereafter to withdraw thy goodness from sir William Garret and his company , who have true meaning in all their doings , and are ready to serve thy highness at all times , using many other words to the advancement of your credits , 178 
 and the disgracing of your enemies , and so I ended for that time . 
 Then said his Majesty , We have herd you , and will consider of all things further , when we have read the Queen our sisters letters : to whom I answered , that I supposed his Majesty should by those letters understand her highness full mind to his contentation , and what wanted in writing , I had credit to accomplish in word . Wherewith his Majesty seemed to be well pleased , and commanded me to fit down . And after pausing a while , his Majesty said these words unto me , It is now a time which we spend in fasting , and praying , being the week before Easter , and for that we will shortly depart from hence , towards our borders of Novgorod , we can not give you answer , nor your dispatch here , but you shall go from hence , and tarry us upon the way , where we will shortly come , and then you shall know our pleasure , and have your dispatch . And so I was dismissed to my lodging , and the same day I had a dinner ready dressed sent me from his Majesty , with great store of drinks , of diverse sorts , and the next day following , being the foure and twentieth of March aforesaid , the chief Secretary to his Majesty , sent unto me a Gentleman , to signify unto me , that the Emperors Majesties pleasure was , I should immediately depart towards a City , called Otwer , three hundred miles from the aforesaid Sloboda , and there to tarry his highness coming unto a place called Staryts , three score miles from the said Otwer . 
 Then I sent my Interpretor to the chief Secretary , requesting him to further , and show his favour unto our said merchant's in their suits , which they should have occasion to move in my absence : who sent me word again , that they should be well assured of his friendship , and furtherance in all their suits . And forthwith post horses were sent me , with a Gentleman to conduct me . And so departing from the said Sloboda , I arrived at the said Otwer , the 28. of March aforesaid , 
 179 
 where I remained till the eight of May following . Then I was sent for to come unto his Majesty , to the said Staryts , where I arrived the tenth of the same , and the twelfth of the same I was appointed to come to the chief Secretary , who at our meeting said unto me these words . 
 Our Lord Emperor , and great Duke , hath not only perused the Queen her highness letters sent by you , and thereby doth perceive her mind , as well touching their princely affairs , as also her earnest request in the merchant's behalf , but also hath well pondered your words . And therefore his Majesties pleasure is , that you let me understand what suits you have to move in the merchant's behalf , or otherwise , for that to morrow you shall have access again unto his highness , and shall have full answer in all things , with your dispatch away . 
 Then after long conference had with him of diverse matters I gave him in writing certain brief articles of requests , which I had drawn out ready , as followeth : 
 i First the Queens Majesty her request is , that it would please the Emperor's highness to let me know the just cause of his great displeasure fallen upon sir William Garrard , & his company , who never deserved the same , to their knowledge . 
 2 Also that it would please his highness not to give credit unto false and untrue reports , by such as seek to sow dissension , and break friendship betwixt the Queens highness , and his Majesty . 
 3 Also that it would please his Majesty to receive the said sir William Garrard , with his company into his favour again , and to restore them to their former privileges and liberties , for free traffic in , and through , and out of all his Majesties dominions , in as ample manner as aforetime , according to his princely letters of privilege , and accustomed goodness . 
 4 Also it would please his highness to grant , that the said company of merchant's may have justice of all 
 180 
 his subject's , as well for money owing unto them , as other their griefs and injuries , throughout all his dominions suffered since the time of his displeasure , during which time , the merchant's were forced by severe justice to answer to all men's demands , but theirs could not be herd . 
 5 Also that his Majesty would understand , that much debts are owing to the said merchant's , by diverse of his Nobility , whereof part are in durance , and some executed , and the said merchant's know not how to be paid , and answered the same , except his highness pity their case , and command some order to be taken therein . 
 6 Also it would please his highness to command that the said merchant's may be paid all such sum or sums of money as are owing , and due unto them by his Majesty , for wares , as well English , as Shamaki , taken into his highness treasury by his officers in sundry places , the long forbearing whereof hath be , and is great hindrance to the said company of merchant's . 
 7 Also it would please his Majesty to understand , that at this present time there are in Persia of English merchant's , Thomas Banister , and Geffrey Ducket , with their company , & goods , ready to come into his Majesties country of Astracan , and would have come the last year , but that the ship , with our merchant's and mariners appointed to go for them , were stayed at Astracan by his highness Captain there , to the great hindrance of the said merchant's . Wherefore it may now please his Majesty to direct his princely letters unto his Captains and rulers , both at Astracan and Cazan , not only to suffer our people , as well merchant's as mariners , quietly and freely to pass and repass with their ships , barks , or other vessels down the river Volga , and over the Mare Caspium , to fetch the said English merchant's , with their company and goods , out of the said Persia , into his Majesties dominions , but also that it would please his highness streightly to 181 
 command , that when the said Thomas Banister , and Geffrey Ducket , with their charge , shall arrive at the said Astracan , his Majesties Captain there , and in all other places upon the river Volga , shall so aid and assist the said merchant's , as they may be safely conducted out of the danger of the Crimmes , and other their enemies . 
 8 Also it may please his highness to understand , that lately our merchant's coming from Shamaki , have be ill used by his Majesties Customers , both at Astracan and Cazan , at both which places they were forced to pay custom for their wares , although they sold no part thereof , but brought the same into his highness treasury at Sloboda : and the said Customers did not only exact , and take much more custom then was due by his Majesties laws , but also for want of present money , took wares much exceeding their exacted custom , and do keep the same as a pawn . It may therefore please his highness to direct his princely letters to the said Customers , to signify unto them his great goodness again restored unto the said English merchant's , as also to command them to send the said merchant's their said goods so detained , up to the Mosco , they paying such custom for the same , as shall be by his Majesty appointed . 
 9 Also that it would please his highness to grant , that sir William Garrard with his company may establish their trade for merchandise at Colmogro in Dwina , and that such wares as shall be brought out of our Country fit for his treasury might be looked upon , and received by his officers there : and that his Majesties people trafficking with our merchant's may bring down their commodities to the said Colmogro , by means whereof the said English merchant's avoiding great troubles and charges , in transporting their goods so far , and into so many places of his dominions , may fell the same better cheap , to the benefit of his Majesties subject's . 
 182 
 io Also if it seemed good to his highness , that the whole trade likewise from Persia , Boghar , and all other those Countries' beyond the Mare Caspium , might be established at Astracan , the ancient Marte town in times past , which would be both for the great honour and profit of his Majesty , and subject's , as I am well able to prove , if it will please his highness to appoint any of his counsel to talk with me therein . 
 ii Also forasmuch as it pleased his Majesty , immediately after the burning of the Mosco , to command that the said English merchant's should give in a note into his Treasury , for their losses sustained by the said fire , which was done by William Rowly , then chief Agent for sir William Garrard and his company , and the particulars in the same note consumed with the said fire did amount to the sum of 10000. rubbles and above : It may please his highness of his accustomed goodness and great clemency to consider of the same , and to give the said company so much as shall seem good unto his Majesty , towards their said losses . 
 12 Also that it will please his highness to understand that the Queens most excellent Majesty , at the earnest suit and request of Andrea Savin his Majesties Ambassador , did not only pardon and forgive Thomas Glover his great and grievous offences towards her highness committed , only for his Majesties sake , but also commanded sir William Garrard with his company , to deal favourably with the said Glover in his accounts , to whom he was indebted greatly , and being their servant , detained their goods in his hands a long time : whereupon the said sir William Garrard with his company counted with the said Glover , and ended all things even to his said contentation , and was found to be debtor to the said company 4000. rubbles and above , and bound himself both by his solemn other , and his handwriting , to pay the same immediately after his return into Russia with the said Andrea Savin , unto Nicholas Proctor chief Agent there , for the said com-183 
 pany of merchant's . But although it is now two years past , since the said agreement , and that the said Nicholas hath diverse and sundry times requested the said money of the said Thomas , yet will he not pay the same debt , but makes delay from time to time , alleging that his Majesty owes him a great sum of money , without the payment whereof he cannot be able to pay the said merchant's his due debt long forborn , to their great hindrance . In consideration of the premises , It may please his highness to give order that the said Glover may be paid , and that he may discharge his debt to the said company of merchant's , and the rather for that he found such mercy and favour in England , only for his Majesties sake . 
 13 Also forasmuch as Ralfe Rutter a rebel to the Queens Majesty , and and enemy to his Country , and to sir William Garrard and his company , hath of long time remained here , living of the spoils and goods of the said merchant's , which he wrongfully detained in his hands , riotously spending the same , during the time that he was their servant , and would not come home when he was sent for , and also for that the Queens Majesty does understand , that the said Ralfe , with other his adherents , do seek by all false means to sow dissension , and break amity betwixt their Majesties , and to overthrow the trade of the said merchant's : Her highness request is , that the said Ralfe with his accomplices may be delivered unto me , to be carried home , and none other of her Majesties subject's , not being of the society of the said Sir William Garrard and his company , to be suffered to traffic within his highness dominions , but to be delivered to their Agent to be sent home : for that the said merchant's with great charges and losses , both by shipwreck , and riotous servants , did first find out this trade , and have continued the same these 19. years , to their great hindrance . 
 14 Also whereas diverse master's and artificers of our 184 
 Nation are here in his Majesties service , and do find themselves grieved that they cannot have licence to depart home into their native Country at their will and pleasure : the Queens Majesties request is , according to her highness writing in that behalf , that not only it will please his Majesty to permit and suffer such artificers here resident in the service of his highness , to have free liberty to depart , and go home with me , if they request the same , but also all other the like , which shall come hereafter to serve his Majesty , to have free liberty to depart likewise , without any let or stay . 
 15 Also it may please his Majesty to understand that during the time of my long being at Colmogro , attending his highness pleasure for my further access , I with my company have not only be ill used and entreated there , and likewise the merchant's there , by one Besson Mysserevy his Majesties chief officer , who hath dishonoured me , and smitten my people , and owes the said merchant's much money , and will not pay them : but also the said Besson hath spoken words of dishonour against the Queens Majesty . Wherefore it may please his highness to send down with me to Colmogro , a Gentleman , as well chiefly to search forth his evil behaviour towards her Majesty , as towards me her highness Ambassador , and to punish him accordingly : and also that it would please his Majesty to send down his letter of justice , by virtue whereof the said Besson may be forced to pay all such money as he owes to the said merchant's , without delay . 
 16 Also that it would please his highness to understand , that sir William Garrard with his company understanding of the great dearth in his Majesties dominions , by licence of the Queen's Majesty , ( not otherwise permitted ) hath sent certain ships laden with corn into his highness Country of Dwyna , rather for the relief of his Majesties subject's , then for any gain : yet the good will of the said merchant's lightly regarded , they were forbidden to sei the said corn , to their great discouragers 
 meant hereafter to send any more . Wherefore it may please his highness , to tender the good will of the said merchant's , as well in sending the said corn , as in all other things , ready to serve his Majesty , and to direct his letters to his officers of Dwina , to suffer the said merchant's with their company , to fell the said corn by measure , great or small at their pleasure , without paying custom . 
 These articles being delivered to the chief Secretary , as aforesaid , and our talk ended for that time , I departed to my lodging , accompanied with certain Gentlemen . The next day , being the 13. of May aforesaid , I had warning early in the morning , to prepare my self to be at the Court , betwixt the hours of 10. and 11. of the clock , where I should have access unto the presence of the Prince , as well to receive answer of all things , as to be dismissed to go home . At which hours I was sent for to the Court , and brought into the Chamber of presence , where his Majesty did fit appareled most sumptuously , with a rich Crown upon his head , garnished with many precious stones , his eldest son sitting by him , and many of his Nobili tie about him : and after my duty done , his highness commanded me to approach very near unto him , and said unto me these words . 
 Anthony , the Queen our loving sister her letters we have caused to be translated , and do well understand the same , and of all things as well therein contained , as by word of mouth by you to us declared we have well considered , and do perceive that our secret message unto you committed , was done truly according to our mind ( although we were advertised to the contrary ) and now we are by you fully satisfied . And when we did send our Ambassador into England , about those our great and weighty affairs , to conclude the same with the Queen our sister , our Ambassador could end nothing for want of such assurance as was requisite in princely affairs , according to the manner of all Countries' , but was 186 
 ANTHONY JENKINSON dismissed unto us again , with letters of small effect , touching the same , and no Ambassador sent with him from the Queen : which caused us to think , that our princely affairs were set aside , and little regarded , wherewith we were at that time much grieved : for the which cause , and for the evil behaviour of your merchant's , resident in our dominions ( who have diverse ways transgressed and broken our laws , living wilfully in all their doings ) we did lay our heavy displeasure upon them , and did take away from them their privilege , commanding that the same throughout all our dominions , should be void , and of none effect : and thereupon did write to the Queen our sister , touching our griefs . 
 And now her highness hath sent unto us again , you her Ambassador , with her loving letters , and full mind , which we do thankfully receive , and are thereby fully satisfied . And for that our princely , and secret affairs were not finished to our contentation at our time appointed , according to our expectation , we do now leave of all those matters , and set them aside for the time , because our mind is now otherwise changed , but hereafter when occasion shall move us to the like , we will then talk of those matters again . And for that it hath pleased the Queen our loving sister , to send unto us at this present , and doth desire to continue in friendship with us for ever ( which we do gratefully accept , and willingly agree to the same ) we of our goodness for her highness sake , will not only from henceforth put away , and forget all our displeasure towards the same Sir William Garrard and his company ( as though they had never offended us ) but also will restore them to their privileges , and liberties , in , and throughout all our dominions , and will signify the same by our letters , in all Towns and Cities , where the said merchant's do traffic , and we will show them favour as aforetime , if they deserve not the contrary . And if the Queen our sister had not sent thee Anthony unto us at this present , God knoweth what we should have done to the said

 The causes of the Emperor's displeasure . 
 merchant's , or whither we would have called back our indignation . 
 Then I humbly beseeched his Majesty , to let me know the particular offences committed by the said merchant's , and the offenders names , to the intent I might make report thereof , unto the Queens Majesty , my mistress , accordingly , that the said offenders might receive just punishments for their deserts : but he said , I should not know them , because he had clearly remitted all offences : and further , that it was not princely to forgive , and after to accuse the parties , whereby her Majesties displeasure might fallen upon them at home . Notwithstanding I did after understand some part thereof , by other means . 
 Then his Majesty proceeding in talk , said : As touching the articles of request , concerning the merchants affairs , which you did yesterday deliver unto our Secretary , we have not only read the same our self , but also have appointed our said Secretary to declare unto you our mind , and answer to the same . And for that we are now upon our journey towards our borders , and will depart from hence shortly , we will dismiss you to the Queen our loving sister , your mistress , with our letters , & full mind by word of mouth , touching all your requests , & will send a gentleman one of our household with you to safe conduct you to your ships : and of our goodness will give you victuals , boats , men , and post horses , so many as you shall need . And therewith his Majesty standing up , and putting off his cap , said unto me these words . Do our hearty commendations unto our loving sister , Queen Elizabeth , unto whom we wish long life , with happy success : and therewith his highness extended his hand to me to kiss , and commanded his son , sitting by him , to send the like commendations , which he did , whose hand likewise I kissed . And then his Majesty caused me to fit down , and commanded wine and drinks of diverse sorts to be brought , whereof he gave me to drink with his own hand , and so after 1 departed . 
 188 
 Then the next day , being the 14 of May aforesaid , I was sent for to come to the chief Secretary , & one other of the counsel with him , who at our meeting said unto me these words : We are appointed by the Emperor his majesty , to give you answer from his Highness , touching your requests delivered in writing , which his Majesty himself hath perused , & answered as follows . 
 1 To the first request it is answered , that all his Majesties griefs and displeasure ( now put away from the merchant's ) did grow , because the Queens Majesty did not accomplish and end with his ambassador , his secret and weighty affairs , according to his expectation , and the promise made by Thomas Randolph , at his being here : and also of the ill behaviour of your merchant's resident here in our Country , as his Majesty did himself yesterday declare unto you . 
 2 To the second , his Majesty wills you to understand , that he hath not , nor will not hereafter be moved to break friendship with the Queens Majesty , without good and just cause . 
 3 To the third , you are answered by the Emperor's Majesty himself , that his great goodness and favour again unto the merchant's shall be restored , and the same to be known by his gracious letters of privilege now again granted . 
 4 To the fourth , his majesty hath commanded , that your merchant's here resident shall exhibit , and put in writing unto me his Majesties Secretary , all their griefs , and complaints , as well for debts , as other injuries ofired them since the time of his Highness displeasure , and they shall have justice truly ministered throughout all his Majesties dominions without delay . 
 5 To the fifth , his majesty does not know of any debts due unto the merchant's , by any of his Noblemen , as is alleged : and whither it be true or no , he knoweth not : the truth whereof must be tried out , and thereupon answer to be given : and hereafter his majesty would not have the merchant's to trust his people with too much . 
 189 
 6 To the sixth , it is answered , that his majesty hath commanded search to be made what money is owing to the merchants , for wares received into his treasury , as in the article : ( the most of the books of account being burned in the Mosco ) and such as is due , & found meet to be paid , shall be paid forthwith to the merchants , their factors or servants , which shall come for the same . And for payment of the rest , his majesties further pleasure shall be signified hereafter . 
 7 To the 7 his Majesties answer is , that letters shall be written forthwith to his captains of Astracan , and Cazan , and other his officers , upon the river Volga , to whom it appertaineth , not only to suffer your people , both merchants , & mariners , to pass with their ships , or barks , from Astracan , over the Mare caspium , to fetch Thomas Banister , and Geofry Ducket , with their company , and goods out of Persia , but also when they shall arrive within his Majesties dominions , to aid and assist them , and see them safely conducted up the river Volga , from danger of enemies . 
 8 To the eight , his majesty hath commanded letters to be written to the Customers , both of Astracan and Cazan , to make restitution to the English merchant's of their goods so detained by them for custom , & to take custom for the same , according to his Majesties letters of privilege . 
 9 10 To the ninth and tenth articles , his Majesty will consider of those matters , and hereafter will signify his princely pleasure therein . 
 11 To the eleventh , as touching and inventory given into the treasury , what goods the merchant's had burned in the Mosco , in their houses there , his Majesties pleasure was to understand the same , to the intent he might know the losses of all strangers at that present , but not to make restitution , for that it was Gods doing , and not the Emperors . 
 12 To the twelfth , concerning Thomas Glover , his Majesty was informed by his Ambassador of the 
 190 
 Queens great mercy and clemency towards the said Thomas , for his sake , which his Highness received in good part , but what agreement or dealings was betwixt the said sir William Garrard , & his company , & the said Glover , or what he does owe unto the said merchant's , his Majesty does not know . And as for the money which the said Thomas says is owing unto him by the Emperor , his Majesties pleasure is , that so much as shall be found due , & growing upon wares delivered unto the treasury , out of the time of his Majesties displeasure , shall be paid forthwith to the said Thomas , and the rest is forfeited unto his Majesty , and taken for a fine , as appertaining to Rutter and Bennet , accounted traitors unto his Highness , during the time of his displeasure . 
 13 To the thirteenth article , concerning Rutter to be delivered unto you , to be carried home , the answer was , that as his Majesty will not detain any English man in his Country , that is willing to go home , according to the Queens request : even so will he not force any to depart , that is willing to tarry with him . Yet his Highness , to satisfy the Queens Majesties request , is contented at this present to send the said Ralfe Rutter home with you , and hath commanded that a letter shall be written unto his chief officer at the Mosco , to send the said Rutter away with speed , that he may be with you at Vologda , by the fine of May , without fail : and touching the rest of your request in the said article , his Majesties pleasure shall be signified in the letters of privilege , granted to the said merchant's . 
 14 To the fourteenth , touching artificers , his Majesty will accomplish all the Queens Highness request in that behalf , and now at this present does licence such and so many to depart to their native country as are willing to go . 
 15 To the 15 , touching Besson Messerivey , the Emperor's majesty is much offended with him , and will send down a gentleman with you to inquire of his 
 191 
 ill behaviour , aswell for speaking of undecent words against the Queen's majesty as you have alleged , as also against you , and the merchant's for his outrages mentioned in the article , & the said Besson being found guilty , to be imprisoned & punished by severe justice accordingly , and after to put in sureties to answer the Emperor's high displeasure , or else to be brought up like a prisoner by the said gentleman to answer his offences before his Majesty . And his highness does request that the Queens highness would do the like upon Middleton and Manlie her messengers sent thither two years past , and of all others for their ill behaviour towards his majesty , as may appear by letters sent by Daniel Silvester from his highness , lest by the bad demeanour of such lewd persons , the amity and friendship betwixt their majesties might be diminished . 
 16 To the 16 and last article , touching the corn brought into the Emperor's dominions by the merchant's , his majesty does greatly commend them for so well doing , and hath commanded to give you a letter forthwith in their behalf , directed to his officers of Duina , to suffer the said merchant's to fell their corn , by measure great or small at their pleasure without custom . 
 Thus I received a full answer from his majesty by his chief Secretary & one other of his counsel , to the 16 articles afore rehearsed , by me exhibited in writing touching your affairs , with his letter also sent by me to the Queens majesty . Which being done , I requested that the new letters of privilege granted by his highness unto you might be forthwith dispatched , to the intent I might carry the same with me . Also I requested that such money due to you , which it had pleased his majesty to command to be paid , might be delivered to me in your behalf . 
 Touching the letters of privilege , the Secretary answered me , it is not possible you can have them with you , for they must be first written and showed unto the Emperor , and then three to be written of one 
 192 
 tenor according to your request , which cannot be done with speed , for that his majesties pleasure is , you shall depart this night before him , who removeth himself to morrow towards Novogrod : but without fade the said letters shall be dispatched upon the way , and sent after you with speed to Colmogro . And as touching the money which you require , it cannot be paid here because we have not the books of accounts , for want whereof we know not what to pay : wherefore the best is that you send one of the merchant's after the Emperor to Novogrod , & let him repair unto me there , and without fade I will pay all such money as shall be appointed by his majesty to be paid after the books seen . 
 But forasmuch as there was none of your servants with me at that present ( although I had earnestly written unto your Agent Nicholas Proctor by Richard Pingle one of your own servants , one month before my coming to Starites , where I had my dispatch , that he should not fade to come himself , or send one of your servants to me hither , to follow all such suits as I should commence in your behalfs , which he neglected to do to your great hindrance ) I requested the said Secretary that I might leave Daniel my interpreter with him , aswell for the receipt of money , as for the speedy dispatch of the letters of privilege , but it would not be granted in any wise that I should leave any of mine own company behind me , and thereupon I did take my leave with full dispatch , and departed to my lodging , and forthwith there came unto me a gentleman who had charge as well to conduct me , and provide boats , men , post horses and victuals for me all the way to the sea side , being a thousand and three hundred miles , as also to do justice of the said Bessone , as aforesaid . And he said unto me , the Emperors pleasure is , that you shall presently depart from hence , and I am appointed to go with you . And that night I departed from the said Starites , being the fourteenth of May aforesaid . 
 in 193 N 
 And passing a great part of my journey , I arrived at the city of Vologda the last of the said May , where I remained five days as well expecting a messenger to bring unto me the new letters of privilege , as the coming of Rutter , whom the Emperors majesty himself commanded before my face should be sent unto me without fade , and I did see the letters written to the chief officers at the Mosco for the same . Nevertheless the said Rutter did not come , neither could I hear of him after , nor know the sudden cause of his stay contrary to the princes own word and meaning , as I suppose . But I could not help the matter being far from the prince , neither could I tell how to have redress , because by absence I could not complain . Notwithstanding I used my endeavour , and sent a messenger John Norton one of your servants from Vologda to Novogrod , where the court then lay , expressly with letters , as well to advertise his majesty that the said Rutter was not sent unto me according to his highness commandment & order , as also about the dispatch of the said letters of privilege and receipt of your money , with straight charge that he should in any wise return unto me again before the departing of the ships . And the first day of June I departed from the said Vologda by water towards Colmogro , where I arrived the 21 of June aforesaid , and remained there until the 23 of July , looking for the said John Norton to have returned unto me in all that time , which had respite fully enough in that space both to go to the court to dispatch his business , and to have returned again unto me , but he came not , for it was otherwise determined before his going , as I did after understand , and can more at large by word of mouth declare unto your worships the occasion thereof . 
 Nevertheless , I am well assured before this time your Agent hath received into his hands the said letters of privileges , and shall have dispatch with expedition in all things touching your affairs , according to his majesties 
 194 
 grant by me obtained , and as he hath written to the Queens majesty at this present , wishing that as now by my going the Emperor hath withdrawn his grievous displeasure from you , and restored you again into his favour , so your Agent and others your servants there resident may behave , & endeavour themselves to keep & augment the same , whose evil doings have be the only occasion of his indignation now remitted .
