country and people remain now to be speak of . but what shall i say , my good Hakluyt , when i see nothing but a very wilderness ? of fish here be incredible abundance , whereby great gain grow to they , that travel to these part : the hook be no soon throw out , but it be eftsoon draw up with some goodly fish : the whole land be full of hill and wood . the tree for the most part be pine and of they some be very old , and some young : a great part of they be fall by reason of their age , do so hinder the sight of the land , and stop the way of those that seek to travel , that they can go no whither : all the 82 grass here be long , and tall , and little differ from we . it seem also that the nature of this soil be fit for corn : for i find certain blade and ear in a manner beard , so that it appear that by manure and sow , they may easy be frame for the use of man : here be in the wood bush berry , or rather straw berry grow up like tree , of great sweetness . bear
