close aboard this shore , so near , that we may cast a stone into they , and so overtake any ship .. so likewise if the ship will go on the other shore , than they do go in great danger , because of those shoald and ledge of rock , and so be often cast away . and forasmuch as those ship which here do arrive be bring hither by easterly wind , and sometime with those wind which come out from the sea , and therefore perforce must give a good birth off , otherwise they can enter into this harbour , therefore of necessity they must come so close to the shore : and on the other side where the island of care stand , there may we build another tower foursquare , and plant some four or five piece of ordinance , and this will serve for the night , if occasion be offer that any small ship or bark shall come in here , or any pinnace in the night , to do any harm , or to attempt to burn any fleet which shall ride here at a anchor within this harbour : so the fort be on the one side , and the tower on the other side , keep good watch ,
