hear of in these part . the stateliness and riches of which country i fear to make report of , lest i shall not be credit : for if i have not know sufficient the incomparable wealth of that country , i shall have be as incredulous thereof , as other will be that have not have the like experience . i sail along the hand of the Malucos , where among some of the heathen people i be well entreat , where our country man may have trade as free as the Portugal , if they will themselves . from thence i pass by the cape of buena esperanza , and find out by the way homeward the island of saint Helena , where the Portugal use to relieve themselves : and from that island God have suffer i to return into 377 England . all which service with my self i humble prostrate at her majesty foot , desire the almighty long to continue her reign among we : for at this day she be the most famous and victorious prince that live in the world . thus humble desire pardon of your honour for my tediousness , i leave your lordship to the tuition of the almighty . Plymouth this nine of September 1588 . your honour most humble to command , Thomas candish .
