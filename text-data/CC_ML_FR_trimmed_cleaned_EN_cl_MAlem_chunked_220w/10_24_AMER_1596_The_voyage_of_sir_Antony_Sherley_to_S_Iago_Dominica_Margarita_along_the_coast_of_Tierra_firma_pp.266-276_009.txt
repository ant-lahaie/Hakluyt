do daily increase to the number of three thousand person : but we daily lose of our poor number . while we be thus keep the town , our ship come about unto we , who receive many dangerous shot from the upper castle . our general find himself thus straight , and discreet look into the policy and strength of the enemy , and scarce able to defend any one assault more , send to the fort and to his ship that about ten of the clock in the dark of the night they shall shoot at the upper fort with all possible diligence , and send all the boat ashore , which be accord perform . and we likewise keep a tumult in the town , the enemy suppose that our purpose be to assault the upper fort , ( which God know be most impregnable for we ) retire from their plot purpose for the defence thereof . so we in a soldierlike order with very good safety depart the town , although the Portugal have espy our general policy come very furious upon the back of we , after we have keep it two day and two night . in the road of saint Iago we take a ship with wine and cloth , which do great refresh our man . from
