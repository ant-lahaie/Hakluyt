three have ever draw sword out of a scabbard , as i think . let they which have be bold to say , that i have man enough leave i , so that i have mean to defend my self , give ear a little now unto i , and if they have eye in their head , let they see what man i have . of the nine there be four but young stripling , which serve captain Ribault and keep his dog , the five be a cook : among those that be without the fort , and which be of the foresay company of captain Ribault , there be a carpenter of threescore year old , one a beer - brewer , one old crossbow maker , two shoemaker , and four or five man that have their wife , a player on the virginal , two servant of monsieur du Lewis , one of monsieur de Beauhaire , one of monsieur de la grange , and about fourscore and five or six in all , count aswell lackey as woman and child . behold the goodly troop so sufficient to defend themselves , and so courageous as they have esteem they to be : and for my part i leave it to 93 fourscore and five leave in the fort with Laudonniere
