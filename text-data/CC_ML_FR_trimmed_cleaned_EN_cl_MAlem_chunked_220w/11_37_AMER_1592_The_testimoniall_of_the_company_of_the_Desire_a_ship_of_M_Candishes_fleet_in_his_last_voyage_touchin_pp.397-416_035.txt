sea , when we come to cape Frio , the wind be contrary ; so that 3 week we be grievous vex with cross wind , and our water consume , our hope of life be very small . some desire to go to Baya , and to submit themselves to the Portugal , rather than to die for thirst : but the captain with fair persuasion alter their purpose of yield to the Portugal . in this distress it please God to send we rain in such plenty , as that we be well water , and in good comfort to return . but after we come near unto the sun , our dry penguin begin to corrupt , and there breed in they a most loathsome and ugly worm of a inch long . this worm do so mighty increase , and devour our victual , that there be in reason no hope how we shall avoid famine , but be devour of these wicked creature : there be nothing that they do not devour , only iron except : our clothes , boot , shoe , hat , shirt , stocking : and for the ship they do so eat the timber , as that we great fear they will undo we , by gnaw through the ship side .
