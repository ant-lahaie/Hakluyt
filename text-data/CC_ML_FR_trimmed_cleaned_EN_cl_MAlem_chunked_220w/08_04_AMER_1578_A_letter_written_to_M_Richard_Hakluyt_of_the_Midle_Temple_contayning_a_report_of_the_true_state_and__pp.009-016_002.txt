reason that i do search the harbour , creek and haven , and also the land much more than ever any Englishman have do . Surely i be glad that it so increase , whereof soever it spring . but to let this pass , you shall understand that i be inform that there be above 100 sail of Spaniards . Spaniards that come to take cod ( who make all wet , and do dry it when they come home ) beside 20 . or 30 . more that come from biskaie to kill whale for train . Theise be better appoint for ship and furniture of munition , than any nation save the Englishman , who common be lord of the harbour where they fish , and do use all stranger help in fish if need require , accord to a old custom of the country , which thing they do willing , so that you take nothing from they more than a boat or twain of salt , in respect of your protection of they against rover or other violent intruder , who do often put they from good harbour , etc as touch their tunnage , i think it may be a report of Newfoundland a . d . . 1578 . near five or six thousand ton . but of Portugal Portugal !
