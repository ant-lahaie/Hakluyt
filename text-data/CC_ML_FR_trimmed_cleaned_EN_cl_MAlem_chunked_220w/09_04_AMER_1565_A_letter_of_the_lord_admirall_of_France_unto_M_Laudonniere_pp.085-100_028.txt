. be there present . i will plain say one thing , that the long delay that captain John Ribault use in his embark , and the 15 . day that he spend in rove along the coast of Florida , before he come to our fort Caroline , be the cause of the loss that we sustain . for he discover the coast the 14 of August , and spend the time in go from river to river , which have be sufficient for he to have discharge his ship in , and for i to have embark my self to return into France . i wot well that all that he do be upon a good intent : yet in my opinion he shall have have more regard unto his charge , then to the devise of his own brain , which sometime he print in his head so deep , that it be very hard to put they out : which also turn to his utter undo : for he be no soon depart from we , but a tempest take he , which in fine wrack he upon the coast , where all his ship be cast away , and he with much ado escape drown , to fall into their hand which cruel massacre he and all his company .
