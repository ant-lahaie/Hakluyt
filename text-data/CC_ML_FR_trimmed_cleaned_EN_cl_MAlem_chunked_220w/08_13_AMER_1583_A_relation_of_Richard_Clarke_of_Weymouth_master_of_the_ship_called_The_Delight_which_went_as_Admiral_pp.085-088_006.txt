the shore , think to have go to the grande bay to have come home with some Spaniard which be yearly there to kill the whale : and when we be hungry or a thirst we put our boat on land and gather pease and berry . thus we row our boat along the shore five day : about which time we come to a very goodly river that run far up into the country and see very goodly grow tree of all sort . there we happen upon a ship of saint John de Luz , which ship bring we into Biskay to a harbour call the passage . the master of the ship be our great friend , or else we have be put to death if he have not keep our counsel . for when the visitor come aboard , as it be the order in Spain , they demand what we be , he say we be poor fisherman that have cast away our ship in newfound land , and so the visitor inquire no more of the matter at that time . assoon as night be come he put we on land and bid we shift for our self . then have we but ten or twelve mile into France , which we go that night , and then care not for the Spaniard . and so short after we come into England towards the end of the year 1583 .
