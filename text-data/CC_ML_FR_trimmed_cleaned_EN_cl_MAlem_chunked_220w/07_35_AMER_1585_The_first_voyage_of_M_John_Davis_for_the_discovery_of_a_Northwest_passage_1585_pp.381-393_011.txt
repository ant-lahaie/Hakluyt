So the night come , we bid they farewell , and go aboard our bark . the next morning be the 30 of July there come 37 thirty seven canoas row by our ship , call to we to come on canms - shoare : we not make any great haste unto they , one of they go up to the top of the rock , and leap and dance as they have do the day before , show we a seal skin , and another thing make like a timbrel , which he do beat upon with a stick , make a noise their music . like a small drum . whereupon we man our boat and come to they , they all stay in their canoas : we come to the water side be they be : and after we have swear by the sun after their fashion , they do trust we . so i shake hand with one of they , and he kiss my hand , and we be very familiar with they . we be in so great credit with they upon this single great famill - acquaintance , that we can have any thing they have . with the we buy five canoas of they : we buy their clothes from their back , which be all make of seal skin
