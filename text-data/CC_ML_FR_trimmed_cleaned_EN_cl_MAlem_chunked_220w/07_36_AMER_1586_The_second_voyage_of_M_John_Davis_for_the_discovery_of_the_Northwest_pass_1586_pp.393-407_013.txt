, they have cut our boat from our stern , and now since your departure , with sling they spare we not with stone of half a pound weight : and will you still endure these injury ? it be a shame to bear they . i desire they to be content , and say , i doubt not but all shall be well . the 10 . of this month i go to the shore , the people follow i in their canoas : i toll they on shore , and use they with much courtesy , and then depart aboard , they follow i , and my company . i give some of they bracelet , and cause seven or eight of they to come aboard , which they do willing , and some of they go into the top of the ship : and thus courteous use they , i let they depart : the sun be no soon down , but they begin to practise their devilish nature , and with sling throw stone very fierce into the moonlight , and strike one of her man then boatswain , that he overthrow withal : whereat be move , i change my courtesy , and grow to hatred , my self in my own boat well man
