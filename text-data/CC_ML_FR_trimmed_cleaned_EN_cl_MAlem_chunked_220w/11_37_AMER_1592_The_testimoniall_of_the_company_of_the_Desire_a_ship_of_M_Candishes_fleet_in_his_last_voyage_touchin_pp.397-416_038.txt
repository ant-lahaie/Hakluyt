, nor heave out a sail : so our topsail and spritsail be tear all in piece by the weather . the master and captain take their turn at the helm , be mighty distress and monstrous grieve with the most woeful lamenta - they arrive atbear - haven in Ireland the 11 of June Â« 593 - cion of our sick man . thus as lose wanderer upon the sea , the 11 of June 1593 , it please God that we arrive at bearhaven in Ireland , and there run the ship on shore : where the irish man help we to take in our sail , and to more our ship for hoot : which slender pain of they cost the captain some ten pound before he can have the ship in safety . thus without victual , sail , man , or any furniture God only guide we into Ireland , where the captain leave the master and three or four of the company to keep the ship ; and within 5 day after he and certain other have passage in a english fisherboat to Padstow in Cornwall . in this manner our small remnant by God only mercy be preserve , and restore to our country , to who be all honour and glory world without end .
