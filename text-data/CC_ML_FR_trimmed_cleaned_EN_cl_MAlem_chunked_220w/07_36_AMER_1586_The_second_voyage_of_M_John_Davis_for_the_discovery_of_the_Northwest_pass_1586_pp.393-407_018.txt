think it will grow to my great 402 disgrace , if this action by my negligence shall grow into discredit : whereupon seek help from God , the fountain of all mercy , it please his divine majesty to move my heart to prosecute that which i hope shall be to his glory , and to the contentation of every christian mind . whereupon fall into consideration that the mermaid , albeit a very strong and sufficient ship , yet by reason of her burden be not so convenient and nimble as a small bark , especial in such desperate hazard : further have in account her great charge to the adventurer be at xoo . li . the month , and that in doubtful service : all the premise consider with diverse other thing , i determine to furnish the moonlight with revictual and sufficient man , and to proceed in this action as God shall direct i . whereupon i alter our course from the ice , and bare eastsoutheast to recover the next shore where this thing may be perform : so with favourable wind it please God that the first of August we discover the land in latitude 66 . degree , 33 . min . and in longitude from the meridian of London 70 .
