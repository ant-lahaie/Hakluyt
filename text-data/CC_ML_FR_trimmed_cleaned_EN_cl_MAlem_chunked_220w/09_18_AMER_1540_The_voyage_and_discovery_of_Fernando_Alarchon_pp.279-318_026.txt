i go no far in divinity with he . i ask he whether they have any war , and for what occasion . he answer that they have war and that very great , and upon exceed small occasion : for when they have no cause to make war , they assemble together , and some of they say , let we go to make war in such a place , and then all of they set forward with their weapon . i ask they who command the army : he answer the elder and most valiant , and that when they say they shall proceed no far , that sudden they retire from the war . i pray he to tell i what they do with those man which they kill in battle : he answer i that they take out the heart of some of they , and eat they , and other they burn ; and he add , that if it have not be for my come , they shall have be now at war : and because i command they that they shall not war , and that they shall cease 292 from arm , therefore as long as i shall not command they to take arm , they will not begin to wage war
