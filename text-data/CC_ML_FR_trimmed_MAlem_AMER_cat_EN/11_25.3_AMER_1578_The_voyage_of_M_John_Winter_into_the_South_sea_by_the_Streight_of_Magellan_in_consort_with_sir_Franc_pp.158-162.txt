And run along towards the northwest about 70 league , the wind turn direct against we , with great extremity of foul weather , as rain , hail , snow , and thick fog which continue so more than 3 week , that we can bear no sail , at which time we be drive 57 degr . to the south pole . the 15 of September the moon be there eclipse , and begin to be darken present after the set of the sun , about 6 of the clock at night , be then equinoctial vernal in that country . the say eclipse happen the 16 day in the morning before one of the clock in England , which be about six hour difference , agree to one quarter of the world , from the meridian of England towards the west . the last of September be a very foul night , and the sea sore grow , we lose the marigold , the general ship and the Elizabeth run to the eastward to get the shore , whereof we have sight , the 7 of October , fall into a very dangerous bay full of rock : and there we lose company of m. Drake the same night . the next day very hardly escape the danger of the rock , we put into the strait again , where we anchor in a open bay for the space of 2 day , and make great fierce on the shore , to the end that if m.

Shortly after there come another canoa aboard we with one Portugal and all the rest naked man of the country : of who we have two small ox , one young hog , with certain hen : also pome-cytrons , limon , orange , and other fruit of the country . for the which our captain give to they , linen cloth , comb , knife , and other trifle . in the mean time the governor of the town send word that we shall have nothing , unless we will bring our ship into the haven . whereunto our captain will in no case consent : for all their practice be to have get we within their danger , nevertheless we come somewhat near the town with our ship , as though we will have go in ; but we never mean it . here we take in our man ; and set the Portugal xi 161 l A.D.
