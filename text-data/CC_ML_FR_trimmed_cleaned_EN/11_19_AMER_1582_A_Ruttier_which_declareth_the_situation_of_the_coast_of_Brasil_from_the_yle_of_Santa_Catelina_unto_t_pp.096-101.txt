This river by another name is called Ygai. The Island of Santa Catelina is sixe leagues in length : It hath two small Hands on the North side betweene the maine land and{n}it: and on the South side it hath a shoald of rockes, which lyeth hidden very neere unto the poynt of the Isle. You are to passe betweene the firme land and the poynt of the Isle.{n}From Santa Catelina to the haven of Biaza, which by another name is called la Laguna, are twelve leagues: it is a good haven within : but you must stay the full sea to enter into it, because it hath shoaldes in the mouth, and it may be knowen by a small Island which lyeth a league into the sea which is called La Isla de Raparo, that is The Island of succour or defence, and you must ride there to search the chanell.{n}From this harbour unto the river before named there Rio Grande. is no haven for a ship to harbour it selfe. And Rio Grande hath many shoalds in the mouth thereof. It is a river that none but very small shippes can enter into. Certaine And this river divideth the countrey of the people called Hands 12 Carios from other nations which are called Guavaes. And leagues distant from this river unto the entrance of the mouth of the from the mouth river of Plate it is al a plaine land, and very low: you °Plate ’which" must sa^e a^ ^onS two or three leagues into the sea from aree^n the sh°re> untiU you come to certaine Islands which lye number. twelve leagues from the mouth of the river of Plate.{n}From Rio Grande unto these Islands are 68 leagues. And from these Islands unto the Cape of Saint Marie the coast runneth Northeast and Southwest, somewhat inclining a poynt to the South. The Islands are three, and may be knowen as you come from the sea by two poynts, which shew like the eares of a conie: you may ride betweene them and the maine.{n}From Rio Grande to the Cape of Saint Marie are 80 The Cape of leagues: and the Cape may be knowne by one Island s- Ma™-which lyeth from it a league and an halfe into the sea.{n}You may sayle betweene the maine and that Island, be- from Cape cause there is above 8 or 9 fathoms water. The Cape of Saint Marie. Saint Mary standeth in 3 5 degrees of Southerly latitude. Isla de{n}The Cape of Santa Maria upon the poynt thereof hath a little hill which standeth over against the Isle of Seales. From this coast of Santa Maria you must coast along the The way to land alway on the North shore, and along the same are en.ter certaine Bayes. From the Cape unto the river of Solis are	'{n}tenne leagues, the coast runneth East and West. There IO leagues standeth an Island over against the mouth thereof. From within the this river of Solis unto Los tres Mogotes which are on ^e-the maine land is three leagues. And from Los Mogotes tes ^leagues’ unto the Isles of Saint Graviel are other 8 or 9 leagues Saint Graviel more: all this distance runneth East and West. These 8 leagues. are five small Islands: to ride here you must keepe somewhat neere the maine within an harquebuze shot halfe a league before you come at the Islands, and straightway you shall see a crosse standing on the said land, and there is an harbour for some winds.{n}From Saint Graviel unto the river of Sant Juan going Rio de 8. Juan along the same coast, I say on the North shore, are three 3 leagues. leagues: it is very well knowen by the broken cliffe which it hath, which is a white hill. The entrance into this river is very dangerous: because it is shallow, and none but very small shippes can enter into the same: the entrance thereof is on the West side very neere the land, great Carackes may ride within the harbour. From this Martin Gar-river unto the Isle of Martin Garzia are three leagues: it zia 3 leagues.{n}xi	97	g{n}is one Island alone, and you must sayle along the coast on the North shore: and after you be come unto the Island, I say, over against the same, you shall have three fathoms water, and on the West side it hath a little creeke where you may ride.{n}He that desireth to crosse over the river of Plate unto Rio de Buenos the river de Buenos Aeres from the Isles of Saint Graviel, Aeres on the must shape his course Southwest: and the cut over is Sthe river f sixeteene leagues and upon his arrivall on the South Plate. shore of the river, hee must seeke a chanell of three  fathomes water, and straite he must goe along the coast untill hee come to a broken cliffe and a poynt like unto the firme land, which is distant from this chanell three or foure leagues: and when thou seest this broken cliffe, The first keepe thee a league from it. Here upon this river of Spanish colonic Buenos Aeres was the first Colonie that Don Pedro de Oliver of” Mendoza planted. This river lieth very much hidden: Buenos Aeres, because it is not seene, it is very shallow at a low sea, wherefore you must come in with the first of the flood.{n}From the Isle of Martin Garzia unto certaine small The Isles of Islands which are called the Isles of Saint Lazarus is two San Lazaro. leagUeS) these are shoalds: and to goe thither you must goe hard aboord the maine. for there goeth the chanell: all this is to be passed on the North shore, and with small barkes, and with good heede.{n}From the Isle of Martin Garzia to the mouthes of the river are eight leagues in passing along on this side to seeke one of the mouthes of the river Parana, as it is hereafter described. But you had need first to harbour in a bay, which is in the very cliffe or Barranca, and you must stay for the full sea. And if you fall into the Rio Uruay. mouth of the river which is called Uruay, you must leave it on the right hand, I say on the North side. And foorthwith leaving the said mouth forward toward the West, you may enter into the first mouth although it seeme narrow; or rather you may enter into any of Parana is the the mouthes: for all of them meete together in Parana, great river. which is the maine river.{n}And hee that desireth to goe from the Isle of Martin Garzia to the river of Palmas, which is the best of all Rio de las these armes, or mouthes to speake more properly, is to Palmat' shape his course to the West, and comming over to the other shore, and sayling along the coast Northnorthwest hee shall discover the mouth of this river of Palmas: and hee must enter hard by Los Juncales, which lye on the South side: and afterward within is very deepe sounding. All these mouthes of this river which are 5, are full of sholds towards the East above the space of two leagues. And if the course of the water were not swift there, you could not enter into them, as I have already sayd, and you must passe all along with much heede and foresight.{n}And if peradventure you have passed Cape Saint Marie and are come over to Cape Blanco, consider it, that it is so even and smooth a land, that you can scarcely discerne it a league from the maine, unlesse it be a very cleare day: and after this sort the coast lieth low unto the river de Buenos Aeres. And from thence the coast lyeth somewhat high unto the entrance of the river de Palmas: all the coast runneth as I sayd before. And all along this coast are naughty people, which eate those which they kill, and many Tygers.{n}From the Isle of Martin Garzia unto Sant Salvador is nine or tenne leagues. This is an Island which standeth two leagues within the first mouth : where Sebastian Cabota tooke possession. And this countrey is very well peopled by a people called Carios; and you must beware of all these people: for they are your deadly enemies. The most Southerly mouth of Parana called Rio de Palmas is sixteene leagues long, and it hath many turnings, and many palme or date-trees growing neere it, whereupon it is called The river of palme trees: and forthwith it entreth into the river Parana, as soone as these sixteene leagues are finished. All the other armes containe likewise sixteene leagues in length, saving one small or narrowe arme, which is called The river de los Beguaes; for this containeth fortie leagues in length.

As you enter on the left hand which is on the West shore up this river there are many Isles, lakes and small rivers, and many Indians which are your enemies.{n}From Santo Spirito unto a people which are called Los Tenbuis is fifteene leagues. This is by the narrow arme whereby they passe into the river Parana: it is the more because it is the longer way. From the Tenbuis by this narrow arme upward unto the Quiloacas, which is another nation, are twentie leagues; and all up this river is great store of people.{n}From the Quiloacas, to a place where the Spaniards now have builded a towne, are fifteene leagues. From this towne unto the people called Los Mequaretas is twentie leagues. Here are many sholds which continue thirtie leagues. All these thirtie leagues are sunken landes: where are many Isles, flats, and nations, which are our enemies.{n}From the Mequaretas unto the people called Mepenes are these thirtie leagues. And from hence begin the coasts of the firme land unto the mouth of the river Paraguai; saving that there are eight leagues more of sunken ground.{n}From the Mepenes unto the mouth of the river of Paraguai are thirtie leagues: it is a river that cannot be mistaken although it hath many armes and Islands and dangers, it hath a marke two leagues beneath the mouth on the East side, to wit, an high land, where are 7 points, which we call the 7 currents: and immediatly above these currents there is an Island as you passe up the river over against the poynt aforesaid standeth the mouth of Paraguai. This mouth is very plaine to be found in seeking whereof a man cannot be deceived. From this mouth the river of Parana is divided, which is a very great river: and it goeth unto the towne of Piquiri, which is an hundred and seventie leagues: and it runneth all this space{n}IOO{n}North and South, and in the way are many flats and shoalds; and great store of people, which are a bad nation, although they bee divided. From the place where these two rivers are divided, that is to say, from the mouth of Paraguai are sixtie leagues unto the citie of Assumption. This is a good river, and better to sayle then all the rest of the rivers, which are in this countrey. And from this towne to Los Xaraes are 200. leagues, very well inhabited with people of divers nations, which serve the Spanyards.{n}THE TWO FAMOUS VOYAGES{n}
