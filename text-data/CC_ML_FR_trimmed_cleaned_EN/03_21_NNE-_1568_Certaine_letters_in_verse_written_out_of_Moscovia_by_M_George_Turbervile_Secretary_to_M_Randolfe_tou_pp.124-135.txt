Certaine letters in verse, written by Master George Turbervile out of Moscovia, which went as Secretarie thither with Master Tho. Randolph, her Majesties Ambassadour to the Emperour 1568, to certeine friends of his in London, describing the maners of the Countrey and people.{n}To his especiall friend Master Edward Dancie.{n}MY Dancie deare, when I recount within my brest, My London friends, and wonted mates, and thee above the rest:{n}I feele a thousand fits of deepe and deadly woe, To thinke that I from land to sea, from blisse to bale did go.{n}I left my native soile, full like a retchlesse man, And unacquainted of the coast, among the Russes ran:{n}A people passing rude, to vices vile inclinde,{n}Folke fit to be of Bacchus traine, so quaffing is their kinde.{n}Drinke is their whole desire, the pot is all their pride, The sobrest head doth once a day stand needfull of a guide.{n}If he to banket bid his friends, he will not shrinke On them at dinner to bestow a douzen kindes of drinke:{n}124{n}Such licour as they have, and as the countrey gives, But chiefly two, one called Kvas, whereby the Mousike lives.{n}Small ware and waterlike, but somewhat tart in taste, The rest is Mead of honie made, wherewith their lips they baste.{n}And if he goe unto his neighbour as a guest, He cares for title meate, if so his drinke be of the best. No wonder though they use such vile and beastly trade, Sith with the hatchet and the hand, their chiefest gods be made.{n}Their Idoles have their hearts, on God they never call, Unlesse it be (Nichola Bough) that hangs against the wall.{n}The house that hath no god, or painted Saint within, Is not to be resorted to, that roofe is full of sinne. Besides their private gods, in open places stand Their crosses unto which they crooche, and blesse themselves with hand.{n}Devoutly downe they ducke, with forehead to the ground,{n}Was never more deceit in ragges, and greasie garments found.{n}Almost the meanest man in all the countrey rides,{n}The woman eke, against our use, her trotting horse bestrides.	'{n}In sundry colours they both men and women goe, In buskins all, that money have on buskins to bestoe. Ech woman hanging hath a ring within her eare, Which all of ancient use, and some of very pride doe{n}[I- 385J{n}weare.{n}Their gate is very brave, their countenance wise and{n}sadde,{n}And yet they follow fleshly lustes, their trade of living badde.{n}It is no shame at all accompted to defile{n}Anothers bedde, they make no care their follies to concile,{n}i25{n}Is not the meanest man in all the land but hee,{n}To buy her painted colours doeth allow his wife a fee, Wherewith she deckes her selfe, and dies her tawnie skinne,{n}She pranks and paints her smoakie face, both brow, lip, cheeke, & chinne.{n}Yea those that honest are, if any such there bee{n}Within the land, doe use the like: a man may plainely see{n}Upon some womens cheekes the painting how it lies,{n}In plaister sort, for that too thicke her face the harlot dies.{n}But such as skilfull are, and cunning Dames indeede,{n}By dayly practise doe it well, yea sure they doe ex-ceede.{n}They lay their colours so, as he that is full wise, May easly be deceiv’d therein, if he doe trust his eyes.{n}I not a little muse, what madnesse makes them paint{n}Their faces, waying how they keepe the stoove by meere constraint.{n}For seidome when, unlesse on Church or marriage day A man shall see the Dames abroade, that are of best aray.{n}The Russie meanes to reape the profit of her pride,{n}And so he mewes her to be sure, she lye by no mans side.{n}Thus much, friend Dancie, I did meane to write to thee,{n}To let thee weete in Russia land, what men and women bee.{n}Hereafter I perhaps of other things will write{n}To thee, and other of my friends, which I shall see with sight:{n}And other stuffe besides, which true report shall tell, Meane while I ende my loving lines, and bid thee now farewell.{n}126{n}IF I should now forget, or not remember thee, Thou Spencer might’st a foule rebuke, and shame impute to mee.{n}For I to open shew did love thee passing well,{n}And thou wert he at parture, whome I loathde to bid farewell.{n}And as I went thy friend, so I continue still,{n}No better proofe thou canst then this desire of true good will.{n}I doe remember well when needes I should away,{n}And that the Poste would licence us, no longer time to stay :{n}Thou wrongst me by the fist, and holding fast my hand,{n}Didst crave of me to send thee newes, and how I liked the land.{n}It is a sandie soile, no very fruitfull vaine,	{n}More waste and wooddie grounds there are, then closes fit for graine.{n}Yet graine there growing is, which they untimely take,{n}And cut or eare the corne be ripe, they mowe it on a stacke.{n}And laying sheafe by sheafe, their harvest so they dry,{n}They make the greater haste, for feare the frost the corne destroy.{n}For in the winter time, so glarie is the ground,{n}As neither grasse, nor other graine, in pastures may be found.{n}In coms the cattell then, the sheepe, the colt, the cowe,{n}Fast by his bed the Mowsike then a lodging doth allowe,{n}Whom he with fodder feeds, and holds as deere as life :{n}And thus they weare the winter with the Mowsike and his wife.{n}127{n}Seven months the Winter dures, the glare it is so great, As it is May before' he turne, his ground to sowe his wheate.{n}The bodies eke that die unburied lie they then,{n}Laid up in coffins made of firre, as well the poorest men,{n}As those of greater state : the cause is lightly found, For that in Winter time, they cannot come to breake the ground.{n}And wood so plenteous is, quite throughout all the land,{n}As rich, and poore, at time of death assurd of coffins stand.{n}Perhaps thou musest much, how this may stand with reason,{n}That bodies dead can uncorrupt abide so long a season. Take this for certaine trothe, as soone as heate is gone, The force of colde the body binds as hard as any stone,{n}Without offence at all to any living thing:{n}And so they lye in perfect state, till next returne of Spring.{n}Their beasts be like to ours, as farre as I can see{n}For shape, and shewe, but somewhat lesse of bulke, and bone they be.{n}Of watrish taste, the flesh not firme, like English beefe,{n}And yet it serv’s them very well, and is a good releefe :{n}Their sheepe are very small, sharpe singled, handfull long,{n}Great store of fowle on sea and land, the moorish reedes among.{n}The greatnes of the store doeth make the prices lesse, Besides in all the land they know not how good meate to dresse.{n}They use neither broach nor spit, but when the stove they heate,{n}128{n}GEORGE TURBERVILE’S LETTERS a.d. .	.
