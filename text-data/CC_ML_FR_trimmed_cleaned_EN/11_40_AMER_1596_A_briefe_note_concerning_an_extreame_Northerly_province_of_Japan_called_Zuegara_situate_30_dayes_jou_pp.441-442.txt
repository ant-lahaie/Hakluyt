A briefe note concerning an extreme Northerne province of Japan called Zuegara, situate thirtie dayes journey from Miac6, which argueth the Isle of Japan to be of greater extension Northward, then it is ordinarily described in maps, or supposed to be: together with mention of a certaine nation of Tartars called Jeza inhabiting on the maine to the North of China, never heard of in these parts before: taken out of an Epistle written 1596 from Japan by Fryer Luis Frois unto Claudius Aquaviva, &c. Printed in Latine at Mentz in Germanic 1599.{n}Ot many dayes ago was baptized a certaine honourable personage called John Vongui the sonne of Taigarandono, who is gover-nour of a certaine princedome situate on the borders of Japan towardes the North, being distant from Miac6 thirtie dayes journey.{n}And after a few lines it followeth.{n}This Taigorandono being the most Northerly gover-nour in all Japan hath traffique with the Jezi, who are a nation of Tartars, which from the maine continent resort unto the Isle of Mateumai, being about twelve or Bf fifteene leagues distant from the foresayd Northerly Mateumai-princedome of Zuegara; where they sell fishes, the skinnes of beasts, and certaine herbes of the sea used by {n}441{n}Jezi a nation of â€˜Tartars dweUingonthe continent to the North of China using cloth.{n}The Master.{n}the Japonians for foode, with other such like commodities. On the other side the said Jezi Tartari buy of the Japonians, cloth to make them garments, with weapons and other instruments. These Tartars (they say) are a most barbarous kinde of people, of a browne colour, with long haire on their heads and beardes like the Moscovites: they live by hunting and fishing, and neglect husbandry. This Northerly princedome of Zuegara (as the sayd governour reported to our Fathers) aboundeth with excellent grapes both black and white, which without the labour of man grow naturally in all places, and he promised the Fathers to bring some of these vines to Miac6, that they might be planted there.{n}
