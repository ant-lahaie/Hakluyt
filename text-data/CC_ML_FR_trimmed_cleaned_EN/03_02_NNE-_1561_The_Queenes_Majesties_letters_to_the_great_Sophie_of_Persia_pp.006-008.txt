By the goodnesse of the Almightie God it is ordeined, that those people, which not onely the huge distance of the lands, and the invincible wide-nesse of the seas, but also the very quarters of the heavens do most farre separate, and set asunder, may neverthelesse through good commendation by writing, both ease, and also communicate betweene them, not onely the conceived thoughts, or deliberations, and gratefull offices of humanitie, but also many commodities of mutuall intelligence. Therefore whereas our faithfull, 7{n}and right welbeloved servant Anthonie Jenkinson, bearer of these our letters, is determined with our licence, favour, and grace, to passe out of this our Realme, and by Gods sufferance to travell even into Persia, and other your jurisdictions: we minde truely with our good favour, to set forward, and advance that his right laudable purpose: and that the more willingly, for that this his enterprise is onely grounded upon an honest intent, to establish trade of merchandise with your subjects, and with other strangers traffiking in your realm es. Wher-fore we have thought good, both to write to your Majestie, and also to desire the same, to vouchsafe at our request, to grant to our sayd servant, Anthonie Jenkinson, good pasports, and safe conducts, by meanes, and authoritie whereof, it may be free and lawfull for him, together with his familiars, servants, cariages, merchandise, and goods whatsoever, thorow your Realmes, Dominions, Jurisdictions, and Provinces, freely, and without impeachment, to journey, go, passe, repasse, and tary so long as he shall please, and from thence to returne whensoever he or they shall thinke good. If these holy dueties of entertainment, and sweet offices of natural humanitie may be willingly concluded, sincerely embraced, and firmely observed betweene us, and our Realmes, and subjects, then we do hope that the Almightie God will bring it to passe, that of these small beginnings, greater moments of things shall hereafter spring, both to our furniture and honours, and also to the great commodities, and use of our peoples: so it will be knowen that neither the earth, the seas, nor t^e heavens, have so much force to separate us, as the godly disposition of natural humanity, and mutuall benevolence have to joyne us strongly together. God grant unto your Majestie long and happy felicity in earth, and perpetuali in heaven.
