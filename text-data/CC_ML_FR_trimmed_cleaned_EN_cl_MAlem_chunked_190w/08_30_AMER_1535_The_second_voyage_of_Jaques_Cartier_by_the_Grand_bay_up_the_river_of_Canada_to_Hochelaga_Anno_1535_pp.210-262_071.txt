in a little beast skin make like a little bag , with a hollow piece of stone or wood like a pipe : then when they please they make powder of it , and then put it in one of the end of the say cornet or pipe , and lay a coal of fire upon it , at the other end suck so long , that they fill their body full of smoke , till that it come out of their mouth and nostril , even as out of the tonnell of a chimney . they say that this do keep they warm and in health : they nev ^ r go without some of it about they . we our self have try the same smoke , and have put it in our mouth , it seem almost as hot as pepper . the woman of that country do labour much more than the man , as well in fish ( whereto they be great give ) as in till and husband their ground , and other thing : as well the man as woman and child ,
