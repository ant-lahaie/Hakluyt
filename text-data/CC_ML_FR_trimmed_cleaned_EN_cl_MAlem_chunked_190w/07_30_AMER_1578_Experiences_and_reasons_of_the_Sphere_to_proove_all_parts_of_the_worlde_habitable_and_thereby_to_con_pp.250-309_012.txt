prove by experience , and be nothing dissonant from good reason . therefore whosoever will right weigh the force of cold and heat in any region , must not only consider the angle that the sun beam make , but also the continuance of the same above the horizon . as first to they under the equinoctial the sun be twice a year at noon in their zenith perpendicular over their head , and therefore during the two hour of those two day the heat be very urgent , and so perhaps it will be in four or five day more an hour every day , until the sun in his proper motion have cross the equinoctial ; so that this extreme heat cause by the perpendicular angle of the sun beam , endure but two hour of two day in a year . but if any man say the sun may scalde a good while before and after it come to the meridian , so far forth as reason lead , i be content to allow it , and therefore i will measure and proportion the sun heat , by compare
