i can have sell it all at this rate . i have already get good store of real of plate : for it be tell i that money be a good commodity in Angola . but i must employ some in meal , which be in the grind . all the rest of my money i will send you by bill of exchange , and some part i will employ in sugar : for i have send order to Baia for that purpose . for from this place there be no ship that do go that way . so these letter i do send by the way of Fernambuc , and have direct they to my cousin : for i do determine to settle my self here in this country . there be come down from Peru , by this river of plate , a merchant call Alonso Ramires , and he have bring down with he ten or twelve thousand ducat in real of plate , and be come down to this place to build he a ship to return into Spain ; and there be come in his company a bishop . and thus Jesus Christ send you long health . your love brother Francis Suares .
