rocky and mountainous land that ever we see : the first sight whereof do show as if it have be in form of a sugarloaf , stand to our sight above the cloud , for that it do show over the fog like a white list in the sky , the top altogether cover with snow , and the shore beset with ice a league off into the sea , make such irksome noise as that it seem to be the true pattern of desolation , and after the same our captain name it , the land of desolation . the 21 . the wind come northerly and overblew , so that we be constrain to bend our course south again , for we perceive that we be run into a very deep bay , where we be almost compass with ice , for we see very much towards the northnortheast , west , and Southwest : and this day and this night we clear our self of the ice , run southsouthwest along the shore . upon Thursday be the 22 . of this month , about three of the clock in the morning
