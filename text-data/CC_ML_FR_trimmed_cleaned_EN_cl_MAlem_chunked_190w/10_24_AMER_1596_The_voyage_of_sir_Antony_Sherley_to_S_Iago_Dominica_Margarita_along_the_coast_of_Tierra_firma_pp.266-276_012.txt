shower of ash which fall so thick into our ship from that burn hill of Fuego , that you may write your name with your finger upon the upper deck . depart from this place the twenty of September , we shape our course for Dominica a isle in the 271 west India : but before we come thither our man fall general down , so that the hole can not relieve the sick , the disease be so vile that man grow loathsome unto themselves , frantic and desperate rave , among who our good general part be not the least ; for his disease be vehement , the grief of his mind , the lamentation of his man , and the loss of those who he love be to he torment more than durable : all which with patience and humility in prayer he humble himself unto . but have not his mind be invincible and his desire above the ordinary course of man , it have be impossible that life shall now have rest in he : but God ( i hope ) have preserve he to some exceed good purpose . Dominica .
