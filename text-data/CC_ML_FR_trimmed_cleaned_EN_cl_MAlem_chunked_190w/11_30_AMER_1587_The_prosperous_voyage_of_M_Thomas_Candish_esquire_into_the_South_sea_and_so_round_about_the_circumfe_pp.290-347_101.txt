chase this frigate along the shore , and get very fast upon it , until in the end we come so near that it stand in to the shore close by a wind , until she be becalm and be drive to strike her sail , and bank up with her oar : whereupon we come unto a anchor with our ship , a league and a half from the place where the frigate row in ; and man our boat with half a dozen shot and as many man with sword , which do row the boat : thus we make after the frigate which have hoist sail and run into a river , which we can not find . but as we row along the shore , our boat come into very shallow water , where many wear and stick be set up in diverse place in the sea , from whence 2 or 3 canoas come forth , whereof one make somewhat near unto we , with 3 or 4 Indians in it : we call unto they , but they will not come near unto we ,
