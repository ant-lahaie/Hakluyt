storm : but Pedro Sarmiento be a man of good courage , bear in with the land in this storm , and in a night he be put into the streit , not know how nor which way ; and the other ship run far into the sea , sail to 58 degree of southerly latitude . the storm be pass , this other ship find many island near unto the main land , and so return with fair weather all along the shore , neither can they find any other way to enter the strait , but only that 266 which Magellan discover : notwithstanding that other affirm the contrary , say that the strait be full of island to the southward : but they may be deceive , for if there be any other strait , it be beyond 58 degree , and have never be see of any man : for this ship be far to the southward of all that ever i hear of : for Francis Drake be drive by tempest no far than 57 degree can not know so much as this other ;
