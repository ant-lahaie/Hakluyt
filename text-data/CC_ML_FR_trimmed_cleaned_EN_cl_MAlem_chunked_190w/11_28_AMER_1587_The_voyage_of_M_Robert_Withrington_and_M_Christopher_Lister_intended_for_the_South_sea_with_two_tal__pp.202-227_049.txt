dare we to come on land : whereupon we go into our pinnace with forty shot : but the cowardly villain run all away to the hill , from the water side : but master Lister with nine man follow they , and they flee still before they , and dare not stay their approach : so they come back again , and we fill water quiet , and at our pleasure . the three day of June our captain master Lister , have a great desire for the performance of this voyage , accord to my lord direction , go to our admiral , and request he to give he six butt of wine , one barrel of oil , three or four barrel of flesh , and to have Thomas hood and seven or eight seaman for some of our landman , and by God help he with the bark Clifford , will alone proceed for the south sea : but admiral mighty withstand his motion , and will grant no jot of his particular request . 224 the 7 of June , have no use at all of our prize
