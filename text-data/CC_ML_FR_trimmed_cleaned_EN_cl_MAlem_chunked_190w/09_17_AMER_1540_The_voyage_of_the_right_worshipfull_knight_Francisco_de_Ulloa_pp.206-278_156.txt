port , our captain think it good to launch forth into the main ocean : yet although we run a swift course , above 500 whale come athwart of we in 2 or 3 skull within one hour space , which be so huge , as it be wonderful , and some of they come so near unto the ship , that they swim under the same from one side to another , whereupon we be in great fear , lest they shall do we some hurt , but they can not because the ship have a prosperous and good wind , and make much way , whereby it can receive no harm , although they touch and strike the same . among these island be such abundance of those weed , that if at any time we be enforce to sail over they they hinder the course of our ship . they grow fourteen or fifteen fathom deep under the water , their top reach four or five fathom above the water . they be of the colour of yellow wax , and their stalk grow great proportionable .
