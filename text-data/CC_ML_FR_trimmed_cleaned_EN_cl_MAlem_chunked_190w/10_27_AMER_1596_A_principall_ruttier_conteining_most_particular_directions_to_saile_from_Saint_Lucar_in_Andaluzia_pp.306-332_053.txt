you not the shold , for you shall meet with 12 fathom , and shall have black sand in your sound . And go near to the end of the say Tortugas ( for he that be on the top shall see they all ) as you pass by , you shall find but eight fathom , and stony ground , and that be the shall water you shall have . and you shall pass by a bustle of a tide , that shoules out of the chanel that way : but you need not fear any thing for you shall have no less than eight fathom water : and be past the say bustle but a minion shoot , you shall loose the ground and be in the channel . 331 note . when you shall pass this course , go not out of sight of the Tortugas . and if you will go from thence to Havana , have a fair wind , stir away Southwest because the current may not set you off : and if with a fresh wind and northerly , then stir away southerly .
