between saint germane cape and saint Martha , about two league from the say island , there lie a bank of sand , upon which bank the water be but four fathom deep , and therefore see the danger of the coast , we strike sail and go no further that night : the next day be the last of July , we go all along the coast that run east and west , and somewhat southeasterly which be all environ about with island and dry sand , and in truth be very dangerous . the length from saint germane cape to the say island be about 17 league and a half , at the end of which there be a goodly plot of ground full of huge and high tree , albeit the rest of the coast be compass about with sand without any sign or show of harborough , till we come to cape thiennot , which trend northwest about seven league from the foresay island , which cape thiennot we note in 212 our former voyage , and therefore we sail on all that night west and westnorthwest
