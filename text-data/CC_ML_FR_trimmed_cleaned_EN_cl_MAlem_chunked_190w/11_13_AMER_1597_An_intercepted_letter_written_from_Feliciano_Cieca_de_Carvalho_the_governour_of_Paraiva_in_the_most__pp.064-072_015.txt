these broil the inhabitant of this Parajua forsake their house and dwell place , and so do some of the friar , because they can be suffer to rule and govern . also the Indians have complain against i , because i have burn their village in this last rebellion . wherefore if your majesty do not send some order for this country and see into these case , it will breed great dissension and rebellion among we , and we shall be ready to cut one another throat before it be long . thus i think good , accord to my humble bind duty , and for the service of your majesty and quietness of this realm , to certify your majesty the truth of the whole matter ; hope in short time that your majesty will send some good order to qualify these broil : for there be great hatred and malice among we . Jesus Christ preserve and keep the royal person of your majesty with long health , as it please he . from the captainship of Parajua this present 20 of August . 1597 . Feliciano Cieza de Carvalsho .
