shore upon it , but ride before it at anchor . the land of cape Briton we find to be somewhat like 181 the Newfoundland , but rather better . here towards the west end of it we see the cloud lie low than the hill : as we do also at cape Laurence in Newfoundland . the easterly end of the land of cape Briton be nothing so high land , as the west . we go on shore upon it in five place : i at the bay where the Chancewell be cast away : 2 at Cibo : 3 at a little island between Cibo and the new port : 4 at the new port : and 5 at port ingle , or the english port . concern the nature and fruitfulness of brion island , isle Blanche , and of Ramea , they do by nature yield exceed plenty of wood , great store of wild corn like barley , strawberry , gooseberry , mulberry , white rose , and store of wild peason . also about the say island the sea yield great abundance of fish of diverse sort . and the say island also seem to proffer , through the labour of man , plenty of all kind of our grain , of root , of hemp , and other necessary commodity .
