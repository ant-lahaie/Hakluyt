their sacrifice among our people , take a diligent view of every person ; and such as please their fancy , ( which be the young ) they enclose they about offer their sacrifice unto they with lamentable weep , scratch , and tear the flesh from their face with their nail , whereof issue abundance of blood . but we use sign to they of dislike this , and stay their hand from force , and direct they upwards to the live God , who only they ought to worship . they show unto we their wound , and crave help of they at our hand , whereupon we give they lotion , plaster and ointment agree to 324 ... I578 , the state of their grief , beseech God to cure their disease . Every third day they bring their sacrifice unto we , until they understand our meaning , that we have no pleasure in they : yet they can not be long absent from we , but daily frequent our company to the hour of our departure , which departure seem so grievous unto they , that their joy be turn into sorrow .
