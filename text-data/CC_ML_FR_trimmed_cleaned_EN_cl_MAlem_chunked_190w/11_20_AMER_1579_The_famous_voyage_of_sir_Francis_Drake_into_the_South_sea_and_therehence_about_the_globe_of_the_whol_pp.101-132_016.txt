some beast with the fur or hair on , and something also wreathe on their head : their fence be paint with diverse colour , and some of they have on their head the similitude of home , every man his bow which be a ell in length , and a couple of arrow . they be very agile people and quick to deliver , and seem not to be ignorant in the feat of 108 war , as by their order or range a few man , may appear . Theise people will not of a long time receive any thing at our hand ; yet at length our general be ashore , and they dance after their accustom manner about he , and he once turn his back towards they , one leap sudden to he , and take his cap with his gold bane off his head , and run a little distance from he and share it with his fellow , the cap to the one , and the band to the other . have dispatch all our business in this place , we depart and set sail
