from thence to saint Michael , where we seek to board a Portugal ship , which we find too well appoint for we to bring along with we , and so be force to leave they behind and have waste all our victual , we be constrain against our will to hasten home unto our narrow sea : but it be the two and twenty of December before we can 160 get into the down : where for lack of wind we keep our Christmas with dry bread only for drop of our clothes . one thing very strange happen in this voyage : to wit , that a mighty great whale follow our ship by the space of many day as we pass by cape Razo , which by no mean we can chase from our ship , until one of our man fall overboard and be drown , after which time she immediate forsake we , and never afterward appear unto we . A . D . * 593 * a huge whale pursue their ship by the space of many day , till one of their man fall overboard .
