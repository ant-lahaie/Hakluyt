well content with this messenger , march forward . the messenger pray he to stay his man , and say , if he will come apart from his man , the treasurer will come and speak with he , whereunto he do agree to commune together . the captain only with his armour without weapon , and the treasurer on horseback with his javelin , be afraid to come near he for fear of his armour , which he say be worse than his weapon , and so keep aloof commune together , grant in fine to all his request . which be declare by the captain to the company , they desire to have pledge for the performance of all thing , doubt that otherwise when they have make themselves strong , they will have be at defiance with we : and see that now they may have what they will request , they judge it to be more wisdom to be in assurance then to be force to make any more labour about it . so upon this , gage be send , and we make our traffic quiet
