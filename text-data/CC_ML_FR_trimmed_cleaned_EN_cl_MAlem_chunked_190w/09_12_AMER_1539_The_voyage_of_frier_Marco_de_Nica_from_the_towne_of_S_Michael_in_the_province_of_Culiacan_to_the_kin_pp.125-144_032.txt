morning this indian be a thirst , and go out of the house to drink at a river that be near at hand , and within a little while after he see Stephan run away , and the people follow he , and slay certain of the Indians which go in his company . and when this indian see these thing , he hide himself on the bank of the river , and afterward cross the high way of the desert . the Indians that go with i hear these news begin incontinent to lament , and i think these heavy and bad news will cost i my life , neither do i fear so much the loss of my own life , as that i shall not be able to return to give information of the greatness of that country , where our lord God may be glorify : and straightway i cut the cord of my budget which i carry with i full of merchandise for traffic , which i will not do till then , nor give any thing to any man , and begin to divide all that i carry
