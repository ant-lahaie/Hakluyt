which happen upon their coast of some christian ship , be beat that way by some storm and outrageous weather , whereof none of the people be save , but only the ship , or some part of her be cast upon the sand , out of who side they draw the nail and the spike , and with those they make their best instrument . the man - manner ner of make their boat be thus : they burn down some great tree , or take such as be wind fall , and put gum and rosin upon one side thereof , they set fire into it , and when it have burn it hollow , they cut out the coal with their shell , and ever where they will burn it deep or wide they lie on gum , which burn away the timber , and by this mean they fashion very fine boat , and such as will transport twenty man . their oar be like scoop , and many time they set with long pool , as the depth serve . the king brother have great like of our armour ,
