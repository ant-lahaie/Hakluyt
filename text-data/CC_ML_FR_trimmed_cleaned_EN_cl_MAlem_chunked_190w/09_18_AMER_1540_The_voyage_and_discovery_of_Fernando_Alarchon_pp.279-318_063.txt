they use many gesture in their speech , move their arm , and point at i . therefore i send my interpreter out , will he to draw near unto they , and listen what they say ; and within a while i call he , and ask he whereof they talk , and he say , that he which make those gesture say unto the other , that in Cevola there be other like unto we with beard , and that they say they be Christians , and that both of they say that we be all of one company , 306 and that it be a good deed to kill we , that those other may have no knowledge of we , lest they may come to do they harm : and that the old man have answer he , this be the son of the sun , and our lord , he do we good , and will not enter into our house , although we request he thereunto : he will take away nothing of we , he will meddle with none of our woman ,
