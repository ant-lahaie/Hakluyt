there be a scale ladder set up , and that there be one gate : but the crossebowman sudden break the string of their bow , and the harquebusier do nothing at all : for they come thither so weak and feeble , that scarce they can stand on their foot : and by this mean the people that be aloft on the wall to defend the town be no way hinder from do we all the mischief they can : so that twice they strike i to the ground with infinite number of great stone , which they cast down : and if i have not be defend with a excellent good headpiece which i wear , i think it have go hardly with i : nevertheless my company take i up with two small wound in the face , and a arrow stick in my foot , and many blow with stone on my arm and leg , and thus i go out of the battle very weak . i think that if don Garcias Lopez they defend the wait with stone like those of Hochelaga . de Cardenas
