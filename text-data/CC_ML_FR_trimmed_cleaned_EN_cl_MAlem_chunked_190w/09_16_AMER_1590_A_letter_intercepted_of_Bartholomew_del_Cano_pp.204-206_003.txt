to be dismiss of their office , nor to be arrest , nor carry prisoner to Mexico . when the viceroy have intelligence thereof , and that the country do resist his commandment , and will not suffer they to be apprehend , he send certain captain with soldier to go and apprehend the judge , the king attorney , and as many as do take their part . So the citizen of Guadalajara withstand the viceroy force , and put themselves in defence ; and be up in arm against the viceroy : yet they do not rebel against the king , but say : God save king Philip , and will submit themselves to his majesty , but not to the viceroy . so that all the kingdom of Guadalajara be up in arm , and be all in a mutiny against we of Mexico . i beseech almighty God to remedy it , and that it may be qualify in time : or else all nova Spania will be utter spoil . i write this thing , because it be public know in all place . and thus i rest , from Mexico the 30 . of May 1590 .
