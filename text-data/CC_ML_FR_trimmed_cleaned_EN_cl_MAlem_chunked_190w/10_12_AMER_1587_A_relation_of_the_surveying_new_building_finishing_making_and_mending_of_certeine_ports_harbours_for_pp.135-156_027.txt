mount which lie to the northward , a little fort foursquare that will hold four or five piece of ordinance , and to appoint six man to watch and ward ; and this be do we shall have no occasion to make any more defence , by reason the country be full of rock and filthy way , and all full of wood round about the harbour . and so likewise on the other side to build a little tower in manner of a fort , with eight piece of ordinance and five and twenty soldier to keep it . and this will be of more importance because it must be build on the town side . and a little beyond this place on the northside there lie a creek , where there be a very good anker in eight fathom water : so this fort be build in this place it will defend the harbour and offend the enemy : and will defend the coast along and a point of the land which do run from the east to the west , and reach to the hand of buena Ventura .
