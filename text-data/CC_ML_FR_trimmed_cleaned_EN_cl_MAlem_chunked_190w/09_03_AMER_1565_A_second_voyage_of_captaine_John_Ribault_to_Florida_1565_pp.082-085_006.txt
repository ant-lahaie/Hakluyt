to be there command : that my friend will never like of it , and that he will hardly give i that counsel , if in good earnest i shall demand his advice therein . he make i answer , that he will not command i , that we shall be companion , and that he will build another fortress , and that he will leave my own unto i . this notwithstanding i full advertise he that i can not receive a great comfort than the news which he bring i to return into France : and far that though i shall stay there , yet it must needs be that one of we both be to command with title of the king lieutenant , that this can not well agree together : that i have rather have it cast in my tooth to be the poor beggar in the world , than to be command in that place , where i have endure so much to inhabit and plant there , if it be not by some great lord or knight of the order : and that in these respect i pray he very hearty to deliver i the letter which my lord admiral have write unto i , which he perform .
