of Peru in time past can never conquer this part of Chili , nor yet any other king of the Indians . the weapon use by these people of Arauco be long pike , halberd , bow and arrow : they also make they jack of seal - skin , and head - piece : in time past the head of their halberd and pike be of brass , but now they have get store of iron . they pitch their battle in manner like the Christians : for put their pikeman in rank , they place bowman among they , and marshal their troop with discretion and great valour . now the Spaniard come unto this province send word unto they by other Indians , say that they be the child of God , and come to teach they the word of God , and that therefore they ought to yield themselves unto they : if not , they will shoot fire among they and burn they . Theise people not fear the great word of the Spaniard , but desire to see that which they have hear report
