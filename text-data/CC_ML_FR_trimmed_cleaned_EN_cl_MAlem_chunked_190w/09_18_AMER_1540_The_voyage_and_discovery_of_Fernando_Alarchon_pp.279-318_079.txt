recommend unto he the worship of the cross , and all such other thing as i have recommend to the 313 rest of the Indians ; namely that they shall live in peace , and shall leave off war , and shall continue always good friend together : he answer that of long time they have continue in war with their neighbour , but that from thence forward he will command his people that they shall give food to all stranger that pass through his kingdom , and that they shall do they no kind of wrong , and that if any nation shall come to invade he , he say he will tell they how i have command that they shall live in peace , and if they refuse the same , he will defend himself , and promise i , that he will never go to seek war , if other come not to invade he . than i give he certain trifle , as well of the seed which i bring , as of the hen of Castille , wherewith he be not a little please .
