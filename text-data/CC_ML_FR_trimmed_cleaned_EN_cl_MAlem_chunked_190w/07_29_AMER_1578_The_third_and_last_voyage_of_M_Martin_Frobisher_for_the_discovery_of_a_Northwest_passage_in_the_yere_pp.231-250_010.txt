God send we , we bend our self . and furthermore , he provide better for we than we deserve or hope for : for when we be in the foresay clear place , he send we a fresh gale at west or at west Southwest , which set we clear without all the ice . and further he add more : for he send we so pleasant a day as the like we have not of a long time before , as after punishment consolation . thus we joyful wight be at liberty , take in all our sail and lay a hull , praise God for our deliverance , and stay to gather together our fleet : which once be do , we see that none of they have any great hurt , neither any of they want , save only they of who i speak before and the ship which be lose , then at the last we hoist our sail , and lay bult off and on , till such time as it will please God to take away the ice that we may get into the strait .
