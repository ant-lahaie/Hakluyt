the next day morning i return down the river , and the day follow i come where i have leave my Spaniard , with who i speak , and tell he that all thing have go well with i , and that at this time and the former i have go above 30 league into the country . the Indians of that place inquire of i what the cause be of my departure , and when i will return ; to who i answer , that i will return short . thus sail down the stream , a woman leap into the water cry unto we to stay for she , and she come into our boat , and creep under a bench , from whence we can not make she to come out : i understand that she do this , because her husband have take unto he another wife , by who he have child , say that she mean not to dwell any long with he , see he have take another wife . thus she and another Indian come with i of their own accord ,
