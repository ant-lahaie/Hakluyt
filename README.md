# Hakluyt's Voyages--Computational Explorations #

## Overview ##

The repository documents my 2021-2022 experiments with computational analysis focused on a late 16th-century compilation of exploration and discovery narratives. [Richard Hakluyt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hakluyt), an English clergyman most famous for his promotion of English imperial/colonial expansion, amassed just about every kind of text related to European travel in the world. *The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation* was first published in 1589, then greatly expanded in a second, three-volume edition printed between 1598 and 1600 (he kept gathering yet more documents thereafter, posthumously published by Samuel Purchas). It is a curious text, which, coming at a little over 2,000,000 words, is eminently suited for computational analysis, despite the technical difficulty of processing Early Modern English. My work started with extracting text from a PDF edition, moved on to broad-methods exploration and then focused on representations of violence and the ways in which Hakluyt occludes colonial violence against non-European people while highlighting intra-European (and especially English-Spanish) hostilities.

The majority of the work was done in Python running on Jupyter Lab notebooks, with occasional use of other tools such as MALLET or MorphAdorner. This is very much a learning work-in-progress, but if you see anything fo use, feel free to ~~borrow~~ pilfer, just as I did in putting this together.
